11. Lallah has not been formally charged with any wrongdoing or abuse of authority. Many Haitian activists feel the case against her is politically motivated, as she has been a strong supporter of President Aristide and critical of the army's role in repressing his followers during the military coup of 1991.

13. According to an Associated Press account, Haiti's former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, once again on the run, was found guilty of corruption on May 26, 2006. During a nine-hour trial a special commission found Aristide guilty of corruption and misuse of state funds. A two-year prison sentence for misuse of state funds was imposed. See Michael C.

18. The authors refer to the April 29, 2004, coup by General Raoul Cédras, which saw the return of Aristide to the country in an attempt to return a semblance of democracy to the country. The coup was followed by the U.S. occupation.

19. It was alleged that the coup d'état of 1991 had caused the U.S. to make an oil concession deal with Haiti. In the deal, America made "a deal whereby, in return for lifting the price controls on oil production and sales, Haiti would allow U.S. oil companies to explore, produce, process, refine and market petroleum products in Haiti." To allow this, Haiti eliminated all tariff and quotas and granted them a tax holiday.
