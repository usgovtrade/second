Not Sure Where I Stand is a young adult, English language novel written by R. Crumb, published in the United Kingdom by Virgin Books and Macmillan Publishers in July 2007. The story takes place in a world where everyone has an electric eye implanted in their head. There is no privacy or anonymity. Everyone is constantly watched. A boy named TJ finds a strange-looking, green electric eye stuck to his forehead. Not Sure Where I Stand begins there. In order to find out where it came from and what it really means, he sets out to get it back by following the trail of clues left behind. As TJ gets closer to figuring out where he is, he soon realizes that someone is trying to keep him from figuring it out. And he might be better off not knowing...
