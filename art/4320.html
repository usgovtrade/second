In high school, college freshmen have often have already had a set plan for the fall semester. They plan to go to all their classes on time, study and get a few good sleep nights each week to get a decent grade point average. They do not stress about classes missing (since the professor usually lets them make up missing work during the break week) and have had a lot of time to adjust to their new environment.

College and high school schedules are a lot different. Especially for those with roommates. The hours are different, homework is harder to manage and there are more things that make it more stressful than their high school lives. You can do it.

I know everyone is getting into their college fall schedules, so I figured it would be fun to share my time management tips for students just starting out in college.

Schedule yourself. I think this is the most important thing to do. You should always be scheduling everything in your life in a way that fits your personal life and work life. When you have an assignment that due, you should set a calendar event. That way you can look at it and ask yourself if you need to put it off. You can also schedule in down time to refresh, do laundry, read a book or something to help your mind relax from those long nights. This will help you get more work done.

Set some time for yourself. You need to make sure you’re eating and getting sleep. It is okay to take a break from work every now and then. Make sure you make time for friends.

You will have to read, work, and studying a lot more in college than you did in high school. It is okay to treat yourself to the occasional movie or pizza with friends, but make sure you save time for your school work.

Get everything ready. This may sound elementary, but it is not always a simple task to get everything done. You should figure out how many days you have until you need to get ready to hand in your assignments and get them done. Get everything ready the day before or day of. Sometimes, when you have a huge assignment due, it will seem almost impossible to get everything done, but you can do it! Make a schedule and get everything done ahead of time. It is amazing how well that works out.

You may think that it is impossible to get all your work done and go out and play as a college student, but you have to remember that no one can do it all. Everyone has a schedule and everyone struggles sometimes, but when the stress is there, remember to just keep pushing forward. Take a deep breath, and you will be okay.

I have helped students in the past with college time management, and many things mentioned are things I like to help them with. You can reach out to me on twitter (@alouisena_7) or Instagram (@soubou_lisa) and I’ll be happy to help.
