Over the past few decades, the rates of chronic diseases have risen much faster than the total number of deaths because people are living longer with these chronic diseases. NCDs are leading causes of morbidity and premature mortality in both developed and developing countries. Of a total of 65.3 million global deaths in 2008, 37% were attributable to NCDs and 21% to injuries. The prevalence of four out of five leading risk factors—cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high body-mass index (BMI), and low fruit and vegetable intake—are consistently higher in developing countries than in developed countries, with the striking exception of physical inactivity, which is very high in both. </p>
<p>While a vast majority of NCDs are considered to be preventable, their increasing prevalence can also be attributed to population aging and population growth. Over the past three decades, the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/trhfbirth.pdf">prevalence of undernourishment</a> has declined globally due to progress in global economic development and in the food production, resulting in fewer deaths from malnutrition-related conditions, such as diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, malaria, and HIV/AIDS. This has been offset by the emergence of noncommunicable diseases as major causes of death in the developing countries and the growing double burden of both under- and overnutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Health systems</strong> are challenged by the rise in chronic disease. These challenges include growing health care costs, rapidly increasing costs associated with managing chronic disease, increasing rates of NCDs in rural and remote areas, and inadequate health worker capacity to manage the rising burden of patients with chronic diseases. </p>
<p>These are some of the reasons why low-income countries are facing an epidemic of NCDs and rising health care costs due to chronic disease. A recent report estimated that NCDs may cause about two-thirds of all health problems in poor countries and may even surpass communicable diseases as a cause of poverty in these countries. </p>
<p>Chronic disease contributes to an estimated 24% of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) or about 1 in 10 cases, resulting in a huge economic burden on low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for addressing NCDs </strong>should encompass population approaches, as well as individual approaches to address the risk factors through health promotion and chronic disease prevention interventions, as well as effective treatment, diagnosis, and management strategies.</p>
<p>NCDs are not going to stop growing. In order to curb the growing epidemic of NCDs, especially in the developing countries, it is important to put more emphasis on the health sector and on evidence-based health promotion, disease prevention, and control measures.</p>
<p>Global Action Plan is helping countries to reduce the burden of chronic disease by providing the evidence and building the capacity of local communities and health systems. The World Health Organization's global report shows that NCDs are leading causes of morbidity and premature mortality in both developed and developing countries. But the prevalence of NCDs is rising quickly among the poor and vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>In the last five years alone, NCDs such as obesity and diabetes have taken an increasing toll, especially in low- and middle-income countries. But many governments have not put strategies in place to deal with the rising costs of chronic diseases and the growing burden of the disease. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that NCDs contribute to approximately two out of five deaths globally and account for nearly 65% of all deaths.</p>
<p>The report shows that a healthy diet (eating less salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats), physical activity, and tobacco control are areas that offer the greatest hope in addressing the problem of NCDs, and that by combining this approach with other strategies, such as strengthening health systems, improving access to medicines, increasing access to quality care, and promoting self-management of NCDs, health gains can be made. </p>
