very high quality and affordable dining with a welcoming atmosphere.  This 
weekly event offers $2.00 lunch special Monday - Thursday.  I'm going to 
start with a cold beer and then come back for the great food and fun.  Make 
this a regular date. 

I have a meeting on Thursday at 2:00 p.m. that I will not be able to attend. 
Please call me on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. or Thursday at 1:00 p.m. with any 
issues. 

See you at Joe's!

I have this Wed. a.m. meeting on the 30th floor with Joe Sutton and he said 
that you did not have this.  Can we reschedule for the 30th?

I am having lunch next Wednesday with Lloyd at GiGi's (the best lunch in 
Houston).  Is this something you are going to do?

Let me know.
