You Mangled My Netsuke is the debut album by the American band The Deathray Davies, released on April 1, 2008. It was a full-length album and was their debut release with major label Ardent Records. The album got attention from multiple sources such as alternative rock magazine Pitchfork. The album received more attention for the group's unique use of the accordion as a lead instrument in the form of "Leather Daddy," which became popular among blogs such as Lazy-i.net. On May 4, 2008, "Leather Daddy" was featured on NPR's World Cafe with host David Dye.

On June 3, 2008, the song "Hometown" was featured in a season 3 episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia entitled "Bummer Summer."
