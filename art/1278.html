“That (his team’s) the only team that was left to race,” Hagan said. “I called it as soon as the winner was announced.

“I was like, ‘Dude, it’s over. They just won. It’s done.’ He (the skipper of the winning team) asked if they won a prize or something. I said, ‘No. There is no prize. You’re done. There’s no prize.'”

A member of three straight North American Soling North American Titles, Hagan also represented the United States as it won its first North American Cruising Challenge title in 1999 and 2000.

“It’s definitely awesome to be back (in Fort Lauderdale) since I won that Soling race in 1999,” he said. “I did come up here for the racing, but we were all here for a vacation, so it was like work/vacation.

“It’s so nice to be back here. I haven’t been back since 2000. But if I’m ever in the area, I’m definitely going to come out to play. It’s really, really nice.

“It’s a really great spot to sail, and we have the event so well organized.”

The Soling North American Championship at the 2011 Spring Fling of Sailfish, presented by Fort Lauderdale Yacht, will be open to anyone who makes a North American Soling Rating. Competitors must complete at least five rated races during the tournament series from May 12-14, 2011. A fee of $45 will be charged to compete at the Spring Fling of Sailfish for each one-day race entry. An eight-race weekend package is available for $95.

“Last year’s event was very successful, and it was fun to see a mix of familiar faces, many of whom race with us in the Fort Lauderdale Sailing Squadron, as well as many first-time participants,” Zwier said. “It’s always great when new people experience yacht racing.
