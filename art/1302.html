"Taste the Victory!" "Taste the Victory!" "Taste the Victory!" "Okay." "I made some calls." " I found out what happened to him." " What?" " He had a bad ticker." " You're lying." " I'm not lying." " You're lying!" "He was murdered." "The White House called it a heart attack." " No, it was his heart." " Yeah?" " You're just making this up to get attention." " I'm not." "He said he had a heart attack, and then he choked on his own blood and then died." "Okay, he lied, but I'm not lying." "I checked." "I looked in the papers and I found it." " When?" " A couple days ago." " Did you tell anybody?" " No." " Did you put it on the Internet?" " No." " Did you put it on YouTube?" " No!" "Your whole thing is a bunch of lies." "I found out what happened." " You didn't even know him!" " But he knew you." "You're just saying this because you want attention." " I want attention?" " I'm his son, not you!" "Why didn't he have a will?" "Why?" "Why?" "Because he didn't think he was going to die." "Well, he did!" " He thought he was going to die in the war." " But he did." "He died and you're just saying all this!" "No." "I just know." "No, you don't!" "You don't!" "I just know he's dead!" "And you're just saying all this!" "No, I just know!" "He's dead." "Okay, okay." "Can I just sleep in here?" "Yes, you can sleep in there." "And why are you sleeping on the couch?" "Because I wanna go to bed." "Yeah, right." "I'm going to bed." "Why can't I go to bed?" "I don't know." "Well, you can't go to bed." "You can go to bed." "I don't wanna go to bed." "You're not going to bed." "Just go to sleep." "I want to sleep with you." "That's all." "I just wanna sleep with you." "Fine." "You can sleep on the couch." "But just sleep." "Okay." "Well, is there anything else I should know?" "No." "There's nothing else you need to know." "I'll just go to bed." "Just go to bed." "I'm going to bed." "Just go to sleep." "I don't have to go anywhere, but I'm going to bed, okay?" "And go to sleep." "Fine." "Hey!" "Hey, it's me." "So, I was just thinking, if you ever get up and want some breakfast or something, I'm around." "Or, you know, if you get hungry later, call me." "I don't care." "So, I'll see you." "Okay." "Hey, buddy." "Hey." "How was your meeting?" "It was good." "You wanna do something?" "We should get a drink or something." "Yeah, definitely." "I think it's time we did something." "Okay." "So, how was your meeting?" "It was good." " Yeah?" " Yeah." "It went good." "You're right." "I'm right?" "Yeah, I'm right." "What'd you say?" "I said I'm right." "Right?" "Yeah, yeah, yeah." "That's right." "That's right." "So how was your meeting?" "It was good." "Yeah?" "Yeah." "It went good." "Yeah." "What did you say?" "I said it went good." "Right." " Yeah, yeah, yeah." " Yeah." " So, I was thinking..." " Yeah, you wanna go somewhere?" "Yeah." "Where do you wanna go?" "I don't know." "I mean, I was thinking, like, a drink would be nice." "Like... a drink-drink." "A drink." "Okay." "Okay." "No?" "No." "We could just talk for a bit, maybe." "Maybe." "Yeah, maybe..." "I think that's what we should do is just talk for a bit." "Yeah?" "Yeah, just talk, maybe." "Yeah, just talk." "Yeah?" "Yeah." "You want to talk?" "Yeah." "Yeah." "Are you... you're mad." "No, I'm not mad." "I..." "I just think..." "We should..." "I think maybe we should just talk." "About what?" "About you." "About me?" "Yeah." "You know, how you're feeling and stuff." "Yeah." "Do you wanna get a drink, or do you wanna..." "Okay." "A drink, I think." "It's been a weird couple of days." "Yes, it has." "Can I get a drink?" "Can I get a drink?" "I'll get you a drink." "Can I get a drink, please?" "Okay." "Do you want to?" "Yes." "Okay." " Can I have a beer?" " Yeah." "You can have a beer." "Okay, good." "Hello?" "Hello?" "Hey, yeah, this is it." "Yeah, sorry I couldn't come to the phone earlier." "I was out with a friend of mine, with work." "Okay, yeah, that sounds good." "Yeah." "Maybe we could do it next month or something, or whenever you want." "Yeah, okay." "Good." "All right." "Okay, good." "Yeah." "Yeah, okay." "Well, bye." "Okay, bye." "Can you see me?" "Yeah." "So, how are you?" "I'm fine." "How's work?" "It's good." "It's all right." "You don't have to go back there." "Sure I do." "What's so good about it?" "It's a paycheck." "All right, then I guess you don't need a drink." "I don't need a drink." "No?" "No, I'm fine." "Thank you." "So..." "Are you gonna call me?" "I don't know." "Did you use the phone on your way here?" " No." " Yeah, you did." "I called you." " I must have missed it." " Really?" "Yeah." "Do you ever think about meeting other women?" "What?" "Can I ask you a personal question?" "I'm not gonna sleep with them, so you don't have to worry." "Wait, what do you mean?" "I don't sleep with them." "Like, you don't do that?" "Well..." "I've done it once, but it's not like I'm gonna do it again." "Okay." "Why?" "It was a..." "It was a really long time ago, and it just... didn't really end well." "Didn't end well?" "Didn't end well how?" "I mean, did you break up with her or something?" "Yeah." "What happened?" "Well..." "I mean, she just didn't really work out, and we... we just didn't get along." "We didn't get along?" "Yeah." "You know, and it just wasn't right." "Well, there's lots of people you don't get along with." "That doesn't mean it's not right." "So what happened to her?" "She... died." "So what, you slept with her and then killed her?" "No." "What are you doing?" "I'm just making a point, I guess." "So what happened to her?" "She..." "I don't know." "She left, and then she got pregnant, and then her parents made her have an abortion." "Did you tell them it was mine?" "Yeah." "I was a kid, but I..." "What did you do?" "Nothing." "I just went to bed, I guess." "That's bad." "You should have called me when you were drunk." "Well..." "You should have told me when I first asked you if you did it." "Then maybe it wouldn't have even happened in the first place." "What do you mean?" "You shouldn't have lied to me." "You shouldn't have slept with her." "I mean, you never even..." "Why did you do that?" "Because I wanted to, you know." "I mean..." "I liked her, and I thought you liked her, and she liked me." "She liked you?" "Yeah, she liked me." "So you didn't have sex with her?" "Yes." "Do you love me?" "I think so." "I mean, I..." "I..." "You don't know?" "No." "Well, sometimes you know and sometimes you don't." "I think so." "Do you love me?" "I don't know." "It's really weird asking you that question." "It's a weird question to ask." "Well, what do you think?" "I mean, have you ever loved anybody else but me?" "No." "No, I didn't think so."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:45
