She then continued, "So when I would tell him I loved him, I don't think he knew how to express that love back, and when we would kiss, it wasn't a passionate kiss. It was just like a brother and sister kissing, you know? So I knew it wasn't the right one for me."

Banks added that he is no longer married, and said: "I didn't know how to be a boyfriend or anything."

The former Disney star said she has never had a relationship lasting more than one year with another man, and said: "I was just doing this because I felt I didn't want to be alone. I was having a panic attack in the car and they pulled me over and I thought I was going to die.

"I just felt so broken. I was in such a rush to get here, you know?"

She said that she did not get out of the car for fear that "some freak or serial killer is going to jump me".

Fans of the reality star went on to express their concern, with one saying: "Safety, safety, safety."

Another added: "So just be careful, especially with some of these people."

The teen also told how she became pregnant at the age of 16, explaining: "You know what I like to say about that, I didn't want to have a kid.

"I was too young, I didn't know how to raise my kids. I was a teen mom, but I was in love."

She added: "I would have never chose to be a teen mom because of the way I felt about life. So that's another reason why I'm in here."

Meanwhile, Banks previously spoke to Inside Edition about her struggles growing up, saying: "I had really bad anxiety. My panic attacks went way beyond what the average human experiences. It just got to the point where I wasn't safe anywhere.

"I don't like to do a lot of thinking, because then that means I'm not living, so I just try and stay on the surface and be here."
