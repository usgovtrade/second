defeat the attacks, and we're making progress toward developing a solution."

There was no mention of the two methods that had been reported in November. 
That makes experts wonder why the attacks were not disrupted immediately.

The first method involves an increase in the amount of random data that a 
computer system adds to the beginning of each message, raising the cost of 
an attack and making the messages harder to break.

The second attack method relies on changing the time sequence in which bits 
are transmitted during the transmission of a message. The change makes it 
more difficult for hackers to use codes that look for particular sequences of 
bits.

"If they had applied the countermeasures quickly, the whole system could have 
been kept off-line," said Scott Shackelford, a professor of information 
systems at Indiana University who served as an advisor to the Federal 
Communications Commission when it launched its Internet Security Advisory 
Board (ISAB). 
? 

Other experts agreed that the government is likely to blame for the delay in 
the application of the new security measures. "They may be blaming the wrong 
people," said Eugene Spafford, professor of computer science at Purdue 
University. "But they don't want to reveal the real causes."

? 

As the government continues to blame the ISPs for the attacks, experts say 
that it doesn't help the situation for the ISPs to remain in denial. "They 
should know by now that denial isn't helping them," Spafford said.

? 

As the Federal Trade Commission works to develop and enforce rules to 
improve security of the new email system, the ISPs may have an important role 
to play. Experts say the ISPs can play a major role in helping to increase 
security. They can provide a service that would detect an attack and shut the 
offenders out of the network. The ISPs, for example, could install software 
on their customers' computers that would allow an email server to scan 
messages for viruses or messages that indicate spam is involved.

? 

But, he said, the problem is a cultural one. "The ISPs need to accept 
responsibility and be willing to be involved in this fight," Spafford said. 
But "they need to leave some of the work to the computer security people."

? 

One of the biggest problems with the current system, the experts say, is 
that email addresses have become one of the most popular ways for hackers to 
break into corporate networks and steal information. "People in the corporate 
world have learned to love email," said David Schuetz, vice president of 
security research at the Computing Technology Industry Association, which 
represents the high-tech industry.

? 

"If you pick an industry, there is a high probability that someone on staff 
will have a very weak password or be willing to receive email from a bad 
address," he said. "In addition, many businesspeople have never thought of 
their e-mail addresses as a security issue."

? 

The government's plan will cost billions of dollars and probably will create 
more job losses by putting even more pressure on the ISPs to cut back on 
expenses, experts say. "There's no way the ISPs can do it without laying off 
employees," Schuetz said. "This is a huge cost that would have to be absorbed 
by the companies."

? 

And many experts say that government spending programs are likely to miss 
their targets and make the country more dependent on foreign technology 
companies in order to buy equipment. "This is a very expensive plan," said 
Spafford. "Not only will the ISPs have to pay for it, the people who buy 
computers will also have to pay for it."

? 

One of the reasons the government didn't go to the ISPs sooner is because it 
has been reluctant to take on the powerful network operators and their allies 
in Congress, which has the authority to regulate the Internet, Spafford 
said. The government's delay is a mistake, Spafford said. "The government is 
making its decision about the security of the Internet without any factual 
information."

? 

The FTC was set up by President Clinton in 1995 to regulate e-commerce. But 
it has not shown much ability to accomplish that goal, and its chairwoman, 
Clinton appointee Patricia Ireland, has resigned.

? 

Meanwhile, the ISPs are fighting any federal involvement in security issues, 
including cybersecurity. The ISPs are currently discussing strategies for 
fighting off any government regulation of the Internet. One proposal is that 
the ISPs, with the help of their allies in the high-tech industry, make sure 
that the government spends the money on broadband Internet access rather than 
security technology. The current estimate is that the Internet security plan 
will cost about $50 million a year for five years. But other sources say that 
the cost could be three times higher.

? 

But all the experts interviewed for this article agreed that the attacks 
against the Internet will continue unless the government introduces some 
reasonable security measures. "The situation will only get worse," Shackelford 
said. "This will probably go on for the rest of the year."

??Internet Security: What's in your e-mail? 
Posted April 2, 2001 04:19 PM ET 

Last week's events underscore the fact that when it comes to Internet 
security, there's no such thing as 100 percent. But what are the odds of you 
getting hit with the kinds of e-mail viruses, worms, and Trojans that shut 
down City Hall, Enron, and the White House Web site last week? Our survey of 
expert security watchers offers some answers. 

How common are viruses? 

For those of you working at home, you're more likely to get an 
e-mail-borne virus than someone who goes into the office, even if you 
communicate regularly with them. As we noted last week, hackers are in the 
game for big prizes. Not much chance of getting caught means a higher payoff 
for the effort involved. For many, viruses are not a big issue. But for some, 
like those working from home or small companies, they pose a problem. 

How common are worms? 

A computer worm is a program that copies itself to other computers by sending 
messages to people with common e-mail addresses. The most recent one is 
Mydoom.net. This worm started as an e-mail message that infected users' 
computers if they clicked on an attached 
e-mail message that appeared to be from one of the U.S. mail carriers. 
However, many people were confused and opened the message, thinking it was 
from a friend. Instead, they sent it on to their friends and colleagues, and 
so the worm was able to spread rapidly. This worm hit about a dozen companies 
and organizations that deal with government agencies. 

How common are Trojans? 

Unlike viruses and worms, which can hit any computer connected to the 
Internet, Trojans are programs that hide within specific programs, like 
word processing software, to attack them. As such, most of us are not at risk 
from these types of threats. As one security expert we surveyed said, "Who 
among us hasn't double-clicked on an e-mail attachment or opened a message 
that had a virus in it?" 

Are we doing enough? 

For most of us, the answer is no. As one security expert told us, "We're not
