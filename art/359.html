[The Top 10 Superhumans]

Graphene's unique strength stems from its lattice-like molecular structure, according to researchers at Washington State University. This structure allows for a very high proportion of carbon atoms to be packed into a very small space, creating a material much stronger than the strongest steel alloys.

And yet, it's very thin, being thousands of times thinner than steel. That makes it perfect for replacing structural beams and bars that can crush and bend under pressure. Indeed, the first commercial application of graphene was to reinforce concrete.

A big difference between the two materials, however, is that concrete needs to be hardened in order to gain its compressive strength, whereas graphene's strength remains even when it is bent in two. Therefore, graphene may be better suited for structural applications such as the exterior of a building, rather than for the structural beams or columns that hold up the building.

A graphene-infused concrete has already been created in Canada and is being tested in the field. The team behind it is confident it's the future of building with the material, although it will be some time before it's used on any large-scale buildings or structures.
