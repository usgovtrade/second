(P.s. The "f" in "soda" should be capitalized. I think it's just out of habit, but it should be.)

A:

In the "To Whom it May Concern" paragraph, you might not need 'at all' - instead of "is it possible to put all of the letters of your name in one sentence", you could say "is it possible to put all the letters of your name in one sentence".
You don't want to repeat "the" after every name. Try "the first one to use all the letters of their names in a sentence would be our nominee for the month" - "first one" can be made plural by changing "one" to "ones".
You might want to rephrase it in order to avoid the possibility of confusing us readers - "the first to try" might be clearer to some. I could argue that you don't need "try", but I'm not sure you need "to try".
You can delete "of" at the beginning of the sentence. "Someone from the group that started it all would be our nominee for the month" - I'm not sure why the phrase "who started it all" is in there, unless it's to make you seem more important. The group is actually starting it (you were the one who started it, not the other members).

There are a few things you could fix and still get the basic idea across - you might be a bit too wordy and you might want to change that sentence to get more across in fewer words - as it is, the first sentence has too much information. I think I would try saying something like this:

In our own way, we all are trying to live our lives by the standards set by George Lucas.

This is how I would go about this:

The person who invented the phrase "life, the Universe and Everything" - "LUE" - was the person who lived it best. Every time you use one of the letters of their name in a sentence, you get one vote. In our own way, we all are trying to live our lives by the standards set by George Lucas.

You might want to think about whether or not "lived it best" should be a sentence all its own, or if it is a part of another sentence.

A:

A few points that can be improved

In our own way, we all are trying to live our lives by the standards set by George Lucas.

Let's break it down
In our own way (prepositional phrase)
It has to have a preposition
By (used for two purposes)

used to indicate the means by which something is or has been done
used to indicate that something was done by the stated person or thing or in a particular way

In the first case, it isn't clear if "George Lucas" is being used to indicate some means or a thing or a person.
E.g. "we all are trying to live our lives by Coca-Cola" - this would imply that you are trying to do something, and using the beverage as an indication of some quality that you're attempting to fulfill.
E.g. "we all are trying to live our lives by the rules set by George Lucas" - This is the second use of by.  It means "I know how George Lucas is trying to live his life"
So with "in our own way"
Either "by living our lives" - we are going to take action to live in a manner that is according to George's example (to live by his example, in the sense that we want to become like him in some respects)
or "by the rules set by George Lucas" - if we are a set of people who like George, and set our own standards according to the example he set, "by the rules set by George Lucas" can mean that we are "trying to live by the standards set by George Lucas"
A second point I would suggest is if the question is "Can you construct a sentence that will use all the letters of George's name in a sentence, using words you know or have heard before" - the answer to which would be "Yes".
And maybe this wasn't the intended question but how about "Can you make a sentence, using a variety of words that would use all the letters of George's name in a sentence?"
This is a bit different.
As I see it, the point of this question was to find a single sentence that would use all the letters of George's name in a sentence.
This means "We will be happy with the winner of the next round."
That would be one way to do this.
This does seem to also show that, in the minds of whoever it was that created the challenge, that they would be happy with a sentence that used all the letters of George's name.
You might notice that that person/group is a little ambiguous.
It is quite possible that they would be happy if someone used the letters of the name but would not like a sentence composed of the letters of the name in an understandable way.
It is also possible that they would require sentences containing all the letters to have a coherent understanding.
It is quite possible that the phrasing of the challenge was deliberately left ambiguous so that the challenge would force the challenge-takers to define the challenge.
A final thought is that you could use the expression 'by George' or 'in George' in this context.

"In George's own way, we all are trying to live our lives by the standards set by George Lucas."
"We are all trying to live our lives by George's standards."

You can also have 'by George' or 'in George' for other reasons:

By George!
By George, I had an idea!

By George's standards
In George's own way
