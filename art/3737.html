[¶] She got up, and she saw

defendant in the room and she called out to him, and then she screamed. He ran

out of the apartment. And I think that's when the police arrived. [¶] When the police

arrived, she led them up the stairs to [defendant] in the garage, who was in the

process of dressing."

       The prosecutor argued defendant had not suffered any legal prejudice, stating,

"[T]here was no evidence that [his] defense was harmed. [Defendant] was found not

guilty of all charges. He is not incarcerated on these allegations." Defendant asked the

court to keep his "current bond in place" so he could return home to his two children

and their mother. He said, "I should not be going through this, I can't sleep at night,"

and that "my daughter is scared because she has no idea what happened that night."

       The trial court denied defendant's request for a preliminary injunction: "[I]t is my

understanding that the defendant has made a similar request in this case. . . . I have

reviewed the materials provided by [defendant] . . . . It does not, in any way, change my

analysis." The court ordered, "[T]he bond is going to be continued at this time."

                                     II. DISCUSSION

       In November 2012, in the case that gave rise to the prosecution of the November

2012 charges, defendant was charged in a 12-count criminal complaint with seven sex

crimes against his stepdaughter A. (Case No. 12WF1820). In January 2013, defendant

was acquitted of those charges following a jury trial. Defendant argues that the

acquittal establishes he did not commit a felony against A, so the trial court erred by

denying his request for a preliminary injunction.

A. Standard of Review

       The law pertaining to whether a plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction is

well established. " 'Preliminary injunctions are "interlocutory pretrial judicial

proceedings" [citation] . . . . "The grant or denial of a preliminary injunction does not

involve a determination of the ultimate rights in controversy. It merely determines that

the court, balancing the respective equities of the parties, concludes that, pending a trial

on the merits, the defendant should or that he should not be restrained from exercising

rights claimed by him." ' [Citations.] Because of the summary nature of preliminary

injunctions, an appellate court's review of such an order is governed by the highly

deferential abuse of discretion standard." (People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna (1997)

14 Cal.4th 1090, 1095-1096.) "Discretion is abused whenever, in its exercise, the court

exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances before it being considered."

(Nance v. NLRB (9th Cir. 1985) 705 F.2d 705, 707.)




                                             12
       The standard of review for an order denying a petition for a writ of error coram

nobis is also well established. The application for an order of habeas corpus can only

be based on error of law apparent on the record. (See People v. Kim (2009) 45 Cal.4th

1078, 1095; People v. Adams (2014) 60 Cal.4th 541, 546, fn. 2.)

       Appellate courts give great deference to trial courts in determining whether there

are reasonable grounds to grant or deny a motion for a preliminary injunction.

However, when the facts relied on by the trial court are in dispute, it is the appellate

court's role to conduct an independent review of the factual and legal issues raised.

(Gelco Corp. v. Constr. Laborer's Vacation Trust (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1410, 1421.)

B. Analysis

       The trial court granted a preliminary injunction based on its findings that

defendant's ex-wife's testimony established (1) she was a victim of defendant, (2) she

did not intend to repeat her testimony against defendant at trial, and (3) defendant had

not been shown to have any significant adverse interests in this action. The court found

that defendant had not shown any legally cognizable prejudice resulting from the

prosecution of the case against him for November 2012 charges. On appeal, defendant

contends his acquittal on charges relating to sexual abuse against his stepdaughter bars

the People from proceeding with prosecution for the same alleged offenses against

defendant's biological daughter in this action. As defendant did not address these

contentions at the trial court level, he cannot raise them for the first time on appeal.




                                            13
       A motion for a preliminary injunction is the remedy to prevent the irreparable

harm that could result from any interim deprivation of an important right, including the

right to be free from the actual or threatened violation of law. (Mamou v. Trendwest

Resorts, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 686, 713; see Cal. Const., art. I, § 7.) "The party

seeking the injunction has the burden of producing evidence sufficient to make a

prima facie showing he or she will be successful on the merits. (Mamou v. Trendwest

Resorts, Inc., supra, at p. 713.) The injunction is properly denied if the evidence

produced by the party seeking the injunction does not show such a likelihood. (Ibid.)

       "A successful section 1983 action must establish that the defendant has violated

the plaintiff's federal constitutional or statutory rights. However, section 1983 is not the

appropriate vehicle for challenging final judgments of criminal convictions. Rather, a

section 1983 claim for unlawful conviction, imprisonment, or detention must be filed in

the original court of conviction. [Citations.] 'The proper forum for such a collateral

attack is provided by 28 U.S.C. section 2254, which requires a petitioner to exhaust state

remedies and permits federal courts to interfere with pending state court proceedings

only in limited circumstances.' [Citation.] Because section 1983 is not a vehicle for

challenging the validity of a conviction, 'the claim presented by [petitioner] is properly

characterized as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.' [Citation.]

       "We conclude that the order denying plaintiff's petition is void because the relief

granted was not one the court could grant under its equitable powers. First, the court's

order is void to the extent it purported to grant or enforce the preliminary injunction

because an injunction to prevent trial is a prerogative of the appellate courts. (See

                                            14
People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 1095 [noting that preliminary

injunctions are, in general, an extraordinary remedy and a prerogative of the appellate

courts].) Second, the order is void to the extent it purported to grant a new trial based

on the admission of illegally seized evidence. (Cf. Brown v. Municipal Court (1978)

22 Cal.3d 741, 750 [recognizing a trial court's inherent power to order a new trial when

an error has been committed which, in the court's opinion, prevented a fair trial].)

Finally, the order is void to the extent it purports to grant relief by vacating the

judgment, as it does not appear the court had jurisdiction to grant the judgment

vacated. (See In re Ramirez (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 390, 400 ["Because a trial court

lacks inherent jurisdiction to vacate a void judgment, a void judgment may be attacked

at any time, directly or collaterally."].) If relief is granted on appeal, it must be ordered

by a reviewing court, not the trial court. Thus, [this court] concludes that the order is

void." (People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 1097.)

       Here, defendant did not show that the prosecution of his "current" case—the

November 2012 charges—would constitute a legal injury to him and did not show that

the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on that issue. Defendant therefore was not

entitled to a preliminary injunction.

                                 DISPOSITION

    The order denying defendant's petition for a writ of coram nobis or habeas corpus is

affirmed.
