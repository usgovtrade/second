Cheap flights to Europe for under 18-year-olds under the European Voluntary Fee Agreement 2016 (JERSEY1)

JERSEY1 is a new subsidy system for EU students starting in 2019-20. This EU funding mechanism will help fund your European travel costs for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 academic years.

On top of saving money, you can enjoy more free travel days on many low-cost airlines. With more frequent and cheaper low-cost flights, you can expect to save up to 50% compared with the cost of a student flight using regulated market prices.

Benefits for EU students under the JERSEY1 subsidy system:

Save time and money on EU travel for any destination in the EU under the JERSEY1 scheme

Student visa exemptions for most EU destinations

No application fees for a single-entry student visa from the first day of your studies

Free travel insurance
