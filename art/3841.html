"Uh, "The History of Tombstone."" "Now, if any of you folks are from Kansas, I'm gonna see if I can give him a "whoop" right now, right?" "Hey." "Hey." "I'll bet you got more gold in your teeth than a tooth in a goldfish." "Ooh, I'll race you for that." "What happened?" "I don't know what you can do, but you sure as hell can get it said." "Yeah, I'll bet you know a lot of dirty words, too." "Oh, well..." "No, sir." "That's too much money to put on a dog race." "You better catch up." "Come on." "Come on." "What's the matter with you?" "Keep it steady." "We'll catch up." "I'll cut his throat from ear to ear." "You stay with the stage!" "I'll cut his throat!" "Where is he?" "I don't know." "Come on!" "Come on!" "Come on!" "Come on!" "Get your thumbs out of your asses." "Come on." "Come on." "Whoa!" "I'll be dipped in shit!" "Son of a bitch." "That's the man." "He shot him." "You did it?" "Yes, sir, no, sir." "Shot him right through the neck." "You all right, boy?" "You have to watch for a gun." "This is my town." "The man who killed your friend Shotgun is inside there." "His head's broken open." "His guts spilled out." "Oh, hell, I'm so sorry, Tombstone." "He has no name." "You can't say a man has no name and call yourself a man." "I'm going in there and bring that killer out." "Oh, I appreciate your being here." "I don't trust them to do this job." "You know, he shot Lassiter in the back." "In the back?" "Yeah." "I mean, he must've been mad with grief and rage and thirst." "Drink up, honey." "It'll make you strong." "Give me another one." "It's me again." "You gotta tell me about it sometime." "If we're ever going to get out of this place, you gotta start talking." "You gotta stop keeping secrets." "I've been here long enough to know that you should never drink alone." "It makes you brave." "Keep it up." "You got a lot of secrets, don't you?" "I'll bet you do." "You're young." "You can keep a secret." "And you're handsome." "And you're dashing." "I'm here for the stage." "And I'm going to have a drink." "Thank you, ma'am." "That was stupid." "There you go." "That's a real drink." "All right." "Okay, that's it." "Well, hell." "My name's Wyatt Earp, and I'm here to tell you there's going to be rough justice in this town." "I mean, a child needs to be taught a lesson." "You can't put a child in jail." "I was with the Pinkerton Agency back east." "Oh, yeah?" "How'd that go?" "It was good money, but you can't beat the law for the law, if you understand what I mean." "So are you going to get out?" "No, ma'am." "What are you going to do?" "You going to retire?" "I plan to kill all the bad guys." "What a great idea." "Who are the bad guys?" "I don't know." "That's why I'm going to go after them." "What do you do for a living?" "You don't seem like the type of person that does what you do." "I know that." "So how do you keep going, just to shoot everybody you see?" "Tough, sorry." "What about you?" "How are you gonna make a living?" "I never thought about it." "But I do know this." "What's that?" "I'm going to go after the man that killed my friend." "Can't get my gun." "Hey, you son of a bitch." "Sheriff?" "I'm sorry about your friend." "Well, well, looky who's back." "Come on, now." "We had a deal." "You were supposed to take that deal, and now I'm taking you in." "All right, where's the rest of your boys?" "Where's Holliday?" "You hear me, Wyatt?" "Come on out, Wyatt." "Come on out, Wyatt." "I got a big, big beef to settle with you." "I'm going to shoot you right between the eyes." "You hear me?" "I'm coming out, Wyatt." "I don't want to shoot you in the back." "What are you doing in that dress?" "You didn't think I was gonna let you have all the fun, did you?" "Oh, come on." "Give me your gun." "You know, the only thing that makes you a real man is killing other men!" "That's what it takes." "You have to kill." "It's your nature." "What are you doing in those clothes?" "And why aren't you crying?" "You cry when you kill." "I'm not crying because I'm not sad." "I'm mad." "Mad!" "That's it." "Now I'm mad!" "I don't cry when I kill." "Come on, now." "Give me a nice smile." "That's it." "That's a good smile." "Let me see you smile!" "I'm glad you came back, Wyatt." "I needed a friend." "I didn't think I was your friend." "I'm your biggest friend." "I love you." "Look at me!" "Don't I look loyal?" "I'm loyal." "You're loyal." "Yes, I love you." "And you love me." "And you're my best friend." "And I will never leave you." "Do you feel it?" "What?" "The power, the glory?" "The terror?" "All right." "All right, all right, all right!" "Everybody out." "Get out!" "Let's go!" "Get out!" "That's right!" "Come on!" "Get out!" "Everybody out!" "Wyatt, take it easy." "Take it easy." "You're drunk." "You're drunk." "You're mad." "Get out!" "Let's go." "Come on." "Let's go, everybody out." "Out!" "Just get him out." "Let's go." "What do you want?" "You!" "Put your gun on him." "I've got a better idea." "Put that thing away." "Move away." "Wyatt!" "He's the killer!" "What's he talking about, Sheriff?" "Is he..." "Is he talking about my pa?" "Your pa?" "Let's move out." "Sheriff, what's happening?" "Move out of here." "You're a disgrace to the entire human race." "Yes, I am, but that's beside the point, isn't it, Sheriff?" "I've had a bellyful of this, Wyatt." "You're through." "Wyatt?" "Wyatt!" "Come on, darling." "This isn't the time." "There is no time." "Come on." "Let's get out of here." "What did I tell you?" "Get away." "What's he doing?" "Don't do it, Wyatt." "You know what you're doing?" "Get away from him!" "I told you to stay out of it." "Wyatt, don't." "I told you to get out of this town!" "You've been nothing but trouble." "I told you." "Leave him alone!" "This is none of your affair." "Wyatt!" "Come on." "Leave it alone." "You okay?" "Look at my hat." "Leave it alone!" "Back off, Wyatt!" "Let's move." "There's a man in there." "He's a killer." "He's a hater." "He don't need a reason to kill." "Go!" "Move out!" "What is it?" "What do you see?" "What's going on?" "The posse." "The posse." "What are we going to do?" "We're going to go after them." "We're not going to make a stand here." "Those men are killers." "They can't be bargained with, can't be reasoned with." "They wouldn't listen to me and they're going to listen to you." "We're going to go after them, and the only thing that's going to stop us is total destruction." "You know what that is?" "I've been out in the world, and I've seen it." "I've seen it." "We're going to go after them." "We're going to do it my way." "You sure that's how you want to do it?"
