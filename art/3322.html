When the show started in the mid 1990s, it did so with a certain level of respect for the audience, not always a common thing in reality television. They got up to a lot of naughtiness, and had a lot of fun, but when a show goes on too long, things take on a life of their own, and can start to really be something other than what the show creator intended. When the show was taken off the air for two weeks in 1998, it was re-imagined as an all new show. But Kali and Pooja started a trend, as the girls are now coming back to the screen to play in the ring once again, though each one seems to be in a different phase of their lives. While one has returned, she doesn't appear to be the one that we last saw competing in the ring.

Shyamala is seen working on her house or whatever it is that people do in India. She doesn't appear to be on the show anymore, except for her name to be mentioned on the show. In fact, there is a real mystery about why she was mentioned in the last two weeks. She was never on the show again, and had the final say when the show got pulled from the air. Did she leave the show, or did they leave her? We just don't know.

Pooja was seen the other night in a Bollywood movie with Sunny Deol. She was also named after her idol, Bruce Lee. Is that where she went after she left the show? If she left the show, it was the other way around. She gave us a clue when she mentioned during a commercial break that she had "a little thing for Sunny Deol."

Kali is the one most likely to be on the show right now. One thing we do know is that her daughter is getting on the show, along with the original Chantel and Tami. All of them are in the same age range. So, Kali could be coming back, as well. As she is a former reality show winner, she would be an obvious pick to compete. We know there were talks of bringing her back for a time, when Tami and Chantel were being signed on, as this was the time when it was most likely that the show was going to return.

It's been said that there is a different contestant being produced for each show. There was a different one for Show #1, Show #2, and then Show #3. But for whatever reason, it's not the same person on each show. For example, it's been said that the person picked to be in the "first" show was from an Eastern European country. So she would not have been from the United States. Is it possible that Tami was supposed to be picked for the first show? She was working as a housemaid at that point in time. There has also been mention of a contestant who had a crush on one of the first show players, which can also be a reason that Kali was selected to be on the show as a contestant.

There are too many questions. It's anyone's guess right now. But we have come to believe that this new crop of players is not being picked through a normal tryout process, such as the women at the Miss Universe pageant, where a group of fifty to seventy-five women enter to become "that girl" on the Miss Universe show. Yes, some of those women are being "auditioned" for the show, but only one goes home. The others are just there for background or support. A lot of people have wondered whether or not Chantel has her own show being done on UPN, but that will probably not be the case.

Some women who have been picked have never been featured in a magazine or a tabloid. Some of them have never been on television. How did this group of women get picked? Who put them all together? Who was involved? Who really makes the final decision?

We have heard of an American woman who has a friend in India who sends her information and sends it back, which has been passed on to the producers. So it could be someone within the company who is helping with this. How does anyone ever get an invitation to do this show? How would any of them get an invitation to this?

As we can see, it's a long shot, but we wonder how Kali got the invitation. We have seen girls who never even competed in the ring before being invited to do this show. That is something that is extremely uncommon, and it makes us wonder why. It seems that this may have been a part of the plan, but we're not sure if there is an explanation as to why so many people were called into tryouts with different levels of success.

And what happened to the other one who was sent back? Was she not up to snuff? Was she too weak? What happened to her? Is she still in the same age range and is she trying to make a comeback?

There are a lot of questions, and we have tried to answer a few of them. So many things were kept out of the first season that, well, it will be hard to answer. We also have seen some other women who were never on the show, like Chantel, before and after this, along with some who disappeared only to return. So that makes it hard. We may get some answers next season.

But what is pretty clear right now is that there are too many young girls looking for fame. That makes it easy for someone to take advantage of that and get in on the action.

It has been said that we may see a different woman for each episode. It's possible that this is part of the show. It's likely that we'll be seeing more of one woman than the others. So it's not like everyone is going to be featured equally and equally.

The story is going to be focused on a different woman, so we will get to know her for a while before she starts competing against the other players, so there will be a lot of character development. We've seen this same type of thing with people who get on shows like Survivor. All of us can say that Survivor isn't about who has the most brains. The same goes for this show. It's not about brain power or anything like that. It's going to be about what they do as individuals and how well they get along with each other. Is there going to be drama? You have to know that it's going to be more of a reality show than anything else. We are not expecting it to be anything different than Survivor or American Idol, except for the fact that the competition is going to take place inside of a tarp covered ring.

We don't know how long these people are going to be on the show. It could be as short as six months or it could be as long as four years. We have heard that there is a chance that there will be more than one woman after the first season.

We've seen plenty of speculation about how the show will be like a new American Idol, and many people are trying to compare this to a lot of other reality shows on television. There was a time when we would have given you a one or two sentence response to that, but it's no longer the case. We didn't mind being compared to reality shows like Survivor. We do not mind being compared to a new American Idol either. We do not mind being compared to The Price is Right and even Deal or No Deal. It's not a matter of being proud or embarrassed. It's a matter of not having a good comparison. It's not a matter of us being compared to a soap opera. It's a matter of not being able to describe what's being done. It's just not that simple.

This show has been criticized because we haven't had any information about the women since the last season. Many feel that this has been unfair to us, but the truth is we have just been going on what the show has shown to us. We don't know anything else. We don't know how much money these women are making, and we don't know if any of them have children. What we do know is that they are all really pretty women who are looking to make some money. What we know is that the women have left their families, homes, friends, and jobs behind to be on this show. We know that they are all going to be competing for a prize, and that this contestant can be eliminated in as little as six minutes. What we know is that the amount of sex, drugs, booze, and parties is nonstop. We know that the women often appear to be drunk in public, and we know that a few of them were arrested.

Yes, there is more to see on the show, which we are being told is going to be called "Lies" as well as "Reality." The second season may have been a lot different than what we have seen so far.

A lot of women have been put on different shows, from America's Next Top Model to The Bachelor, and we've seen what that has done to those women. They've lost their homes, their spouses, and a lot of friends because they have appeared to become part of an entertainment industry.

There are a lot of things that can happen to a girl or woman in the world of reality shows</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:59
