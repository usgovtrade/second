Many people claim

You didn't mention any of those, except bookings.com, which is just a more
rigorous way of asking "what should I charge on my site"

Maybe I am looking for a needle in a haystack but it seems to me that there is
a fairly good correlation between temperature and flight delay times and
pricing. I live in the U.S. and I've noticed that summer peak pricing is more
predictable than winter peak pricing. But I'm willing to accept my own anec
data as evidence.

This: "Maybe I am looking for a needle in a haystack but it seems to me that
there is a fairly good correlation between temperature and flight delay times
and pricing." points out that all prices are correlated with temperature. If
you know what I mean.

~~~
bignoggins
Your points is not at all related to what I am saying. My point is that
temperature isn't the only factor that affects prices. Things like time of day
and day of week can all influence prices and cause volatility.

One thing I've learned, and it's a hard-earned lesson from years of freelancing
- is that the client won't pay for what they don't see.

My rule: if it takes more than 3 days to deliver, just don't do it. Or find
someone else who needs to get the thing done - who's got plenty of funds to
pay for it - and who doesn't have a deadline looming (which is, coincidentally
also a good indication they won't pay you anything).

Once the client sees it on your machine, he's got an idea how long it will
take you to get it out there. If it's going to take you a week, he's not going
to think he'll get it back in 5 days. And that may be true because it's been
1.5 years since you sent the last version. So be realistic, and if something
else comes up that's more interesting, take the time you saved and go do that.
(It's going to happen).

If you need to keep the customer happy, then you're back to writing the
speedy-but-not-much-of-a-workhorse code. I hate that, because it gets very
time-consuming. But if you work for a customer you like, and can avoid having
to do it again, then it's ok.

This is a really important point that is a big reason why I prefer small
projects rather than large projects - when I have a 1 week deadline, it is
mostly a one-time investment, since the worst case is that I don't find anyone
else to take over the project. If I have a 12 week deadline and my client does
not have budget for multiple people on the project, it is unlikely that I will
find someone who will put in the time and effort necessary to finish in a week
and keep the project on time.

This happened to me during my second year of college. I had a friend who was
the top guy at a large tech company. One of his clients wanted a feature
implemented in a week. It was one of the first things I ever developed, so I
implemented it as requested (only took me about 1 hour since I was only 15 at
the time and the client had to review).

Six weeks later they asked for a slight modification, which only took me an
hour to complete. Six months later they came back with something completely
different, which only took me about a week, but they still needed me to do
other jobs. From then on out they treated me like crap, and I eventually went
back to school. I don't regret doing this because it made me see how things
can change, but I'm glad I didn't start off my career the same way.

I have yet to see any large development project finished. In all its guises:
from simple database migration, to a complex CMS/website, I've had no projects
complete and workable.

Even the simplest projects, take 6x as long as promised or more, overrun, or
fail.

I know it's just one customer. I've seen more than one project go wrong. But
this is always the pattern. Even my small apps take too long. It's been many
many projects. All of them run into the most complex issues. Every project has
at least one.

Perhaps there is a point to all this, but I cannot even begin to fathom it.

"This is why we don’t write tests."

This is why we don't develop apps by following the steps on an article like
this. We write tests so that we don't run into those issues and that means we
make less mistakes. (And no, unit tests don't slow things down, they make them
faster.)

One of the big problems in our industry is that most things that seem like a
good idea don't actually work. I've been developing software since around 1999
and I've only been successful a few times. I'd love to share the secrets, but
the secret is the things that really work.

I can probably think of a few cases where the things I've done work for small
projects, but when I get larger projects, my advice doesn't usually work well.

The most important takeaway from this article is the importance of setting a
goal for your team - a minimum goal that is realistic, yet challenging. My
team (I run a web app company) is working on a product that we haven't yet
developed, so we can get a better feel for what the right price is. We've got
a few features that we know are "good", but we don't know if they're "good
enough" to charge for.

So we're estimating, and making goals. We already know our initial goal is too
low because we can do everything for free. So we make it one step higher.

Doing this actually seems to drive us all to do better work. Our estimates are
more accurate now because it's more realistic. Also, it's good to see that
we're getting more jobs done. The price you can charge doesn't go up until
you've put in the work. I'm sure this isn't true of all the freelancers out
there, but it's the same at my company. We have customers who are willing to
pay more, but they'd rather use a competitor because of price. So we just
busting our ass to make things that will appeal to them.

I can definitely agree with the article - that having a goal, and using
estimates are great. However, I do wonder if in some cases, we're over
estimating because we want to be careful. It's a risk vs reward - we're
willing to work harder, but if you don't succeed, it's going to be a lot
harder for you to charge. I've noticed that when we've had a product
decommissioned, the team morale tanks and it's hard to get anything done. I'm
sure that's the feeling around the entire company.

There are so many factors that go into the final cost of an application:
personnel, tools, time (coding + debug), hosting, physical location of the
developers (in case of remote).

I've been working for a few years now with small clients and I have a simple
rule:

\- _Never_ tell a client how much I have worked or the time spent. Because
time is a very subjective variable and if we start using it to communicate
cost, we're going to get angry and frustrated. The client will use this as an
excuse to pay less.

\- Always ask for a reasonable amount of time (and keep saying this _ad
nauseum_ to the client). You might have to take into consideration the time
needed for them to think about it, time needed for them to consult a third
party for a quote, etc.

\- Always tell clients the price. Then negotiate.

When you sell to big companies, they have no idea what they are actually
getting, especially if they're dealing with an inexperienced contractor. They
trust their lawyer (lawyer: "The devil you know is better than the devil you
don't" [1]).

And keep in mind that what they believe is an expensive project for you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:33
