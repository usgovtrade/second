It has a top-down perspective, and is set on a fishing boat, which can be controlled with a joystick. It is similar to the previous two titles, but includes more features.

It was not ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System as Bega Baseball and Sega Worldwide Soccer were, but a version of the game was made for the ColecoVision by NEC. It can also be played in Sega GT mode for the Genesis.

In the arcade game, the player flies the fishing boat from the deck, and can pick up items such as bait and a shark cage. Various boats and sharks are the playable characters, with most of the sharks being larger fish including barracuda, grouper, and tuna. Unlike previous games, three human captains cannot play simultaneously.
