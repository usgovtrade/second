"You're a very lucky boy." "The doctors know what they're doing, Dad." "Is this what you meant by "staying positive"?" "I got to turn these in by the end of the week." "This says the last day you can drop them off is Friday." "My roommate has an extra key." "Come on, give me a hand." "Your dad's been in there at least half an hour." "Should I help you?" "No, no, it's fine." "I'm gonna be at work all day." "Thanks." "So I see that you are the proud owner of a new cell phone." "Yep." "I got one for you, too." "You don't need one." "All right, I'll take it back." "I actually have my own phone now, but thanks." "Just let me pay for that for you." "Don't need to..." "Don't need to..." "I'm fine." "You need to relax, though, all right?" "If we were meant to be, you wouldn't be out here by yourself." "Yeah, we were meant to be." "Don't be scared." "Hey, I told you I'd wait for you." "Oh, hey." "How you doing?" "Doing good." "Going to school here." "What's your major?" "Um, I'm undeclared." "Oh." "Are you in the day program or night?" "No, I'm..." "Just figuring it out." "You know, what's right for me." "Hey, I hope we can hang out soon." "Yeah." "You can come out with me tonight." "I don't know." "Sounds great." "It's a date." "How about tomorrow night?" "Do you want to come with me tomorrow night?" "I might not be able to." "I have choir practice tonight, so..." "Oh." "Yeah, you're right." "What about Sunday?" "What about Sunday?" "Maybe." "Do you wanna meet in the park after my church thing?" "It's at that diner near my church." "They have really good meat loaf." "Or we could do it in your church if you want." "I..." "Uh..." "It's probably not what you expected." "What's up?" "I want you to take a look at this." "All right, let me..." "Look at that." "So..." "So tell me something." "What is it that makes me just so irresistible?" "I don't know." "I have a boyfriend." "Okay." "Right." "What about that guy, is he your boyfriend?" "No." "Oh, my God, is that why you're so pissed at me?" "No." "You're not gonna come with me next time, are you?" "No." "That's what I thought." "No wonder you don't have any friends." "Your father had a word with me, Theo." "About what?" "Well, he had a concern about you and your friends at school." "Why?" "Because he's worried that, uh..." "He thinks maybe they've talked to you about your history." "Okay." "Like what?" "Like..." "Like you know what?" "I'm not gonna let you use the excuse of being a kid anymore." "It's not right." "I'm sorry, but you can't have it both ways." "You can't do one thing one way in this house and then another in this house, it's not fair." "You can't have your friends over here, then you can't see your friends over there." "You can't live here and not go to school there." "Your dad and I have done the best that we can do to help you understand that you've got some issues to deal with." "What do you mean, "issues"?" "Look, I'm not asking for this to be easy for you, but you have to face the fact that we're not gonna be around forever." "Yeah, but I'm still here." "You're still here, but you're here less and less." "You're not even here a week, and then you're leaving with just a couple of boxes?" "That's not fair." "We're not leaving forever." "Yes, I understand that, but, uh, we want to be a part of your life." "There's no school in the world that you can get to where we can't be there to see you off to." "Hey, you guys." "Hello." "Listen, listen." "Hey, have you seen Zora?" "Yeah, you know..." "I heard that she and Max broke up." "Yeah, I just saw them at the park." "I had a job interview, so I was late picking her up." "Okay." "I'm gonna go to study hall." "So you got a job?" "Yes, just part-time, but it's in the computer lab, so that's good." "So if you just get off, I'll give you a ride to school." "Yeah, okay." "I'll call you later, okay?" "Bye, Zora." "Bye." "Bye, guys." "You know that they were getting together to be together?" "Oh, do they talk a lot about it?" "Yeah, yeah." "But you know what?" "I always felt that she liked him." "That's cool." "Yeah." "Just 'cause I didn't know he felt the same." "I mean, I didn't know if he..." "You know, I knew that he liked her." "You never told me what the job is." "Um..." "Okay, I'm gonna stop you." "A little job I do in the lab." "Really?" "Yeah, really." "What do you mean, at the lab?" "I gotta go to class." "I'll see you later?" "Yeah." "I'll see you after class." "Later." "Hello?" "Oh, hey." "Come in." "Sorry, I had a class at the gym." "It didn't show up in the phone logs." "Sorry." "You should have called." "I was just working." "What's going on?" "I thought we were gonna play the song?" "What song?" "The song I wrote for you?" "It's..." "It's kind of a long story." "You said you wanted to hear it." "Yeah, sure." "Um..." "Well, you have three minutes." "Great, okay." "Have a seat." "It's okay, I'll sit down." "Oh, yeah." "Thanks, Dad." "Listen, I just wanted to call and tell you that..." "That I think it's great that you got the job." "Well, great for you." "Yeah, I'm so proud of you." "I'm so proud of you, too." "Thanks." "I'll tell you, it has been such a struggle for me, um, just to find a job to make ends meet, and..." "Uh, I don't know why I'm telling you all this stuff." "I mean, we hardly ever talk." "It's fine." "No, it's not fine." "Dad..." "I think I'm in love with someone." "I don't know how I could have done that without realizing it until now." "I just..." "It came as a total shock to me." "No." "What?" "What are you talking about?" "Who?" "What's her name?" "Her name is Marissa." "I knew her." "She was my girl back in Jersey." "And, yeah, I kinda..." "I was in love with her." "Uh-huh?" "Yeah." "I was in love with her, but I didn't..." "I didn't realize it until recently." "I knew she had an ex, but I never thought about that." "Well, then what happened?" "I just found out that she's been seeing Max all along." "Well, then, obviously, she lied to you when she said she didn't like him." "Do you want me to talk to her?" "Well, now you're being silly." "You think I'm stupid." "No, no." "No, I'm saying that's what I mean, I'm sorry." "I was just saying that you're being silly for even thinking that." "Look, she lied to me." "You're my dad." "I love you." "Yeah, I love you, too." "So you have nothing to be jealous about." "No, no." "I know you're in love with her." "Dad, why would you say that?" "Is that why you didn't call her?" "Oh, well, she said she was gonna call you back." "Look, I was just..." "I was worried about you." "Did something happen with her?" "She said that she didn't want me." "Oh, my God, I'm sorry." "Well, I just..." "Well, let's see..." "Well, I mean..." "I just didn't realize it till just now." "Okay?" "Okay, I'm sorry." "I think I know why you didn't want to see her." "And your mom knows about this?" "Yeah, yeah, no..." "I mean..." "Why didn't you call me?" "I wanted to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:56
