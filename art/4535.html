The mission of the OAIC Program at the University of Iowa (UI) is to improve the independence and quality of life of older persons through a better understanding of normal and pathological aging and by developing and testing innovative and integrative interventions. In pursuing its mission, the Iowa OAIC is dedicated to a goal of bridging the gaps in our knowledge of critical gaps in the biology and mechanisms of aging and frailty, by promoting translational, interdisciplinary research using functional and operational definitions of independence. The goal of the UI OAIC is to stimulate research in aging and frailty that seeks to improve the quality of life of older persons. To accomplish its goals, the UI OAIC will: 1) Promote interdisciplinary collaboration by: a) encouraging researchers in different disciplines to work together, b)providing infrastructure support to promote interactions, 2) Foster the performance of high-quality, cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in aging and frailty 3) Serve as a national resource for research training, technical assistance and information 4) Disseminate research findings and the lessons learned to health professionals, older adults, family members and other relevant audiences so that they can improve the quality of life of older persons. The UI OAIC is organized into 4 cores: 1) Research Core, 2) Pilot Core, 3) Career Development Core, 4) Administrative Core. These cores reflect the diversity of the research activities carried out by center investigators, the diversity of the faculty serving on the OAIC, and the diversity of the type of aging and frailty research being performed at the UI. The University of Iowa OAIC is multidisciplinary, incorporating investigators from the Colleges of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Social Work.
