The Fujifilm FG line of lenses, which runs around $550-600, was only announced at the very end of 2014 and so there hasn’t been too many reviews. With the lens officially announced, we reached out to David Chandler, who often focuses on Fujifilm lenses and is a recognized expert, for a review.

The FG 35mm f/1.4 is a medium-format portrait lens with a maximum aperture of f/1.4 that is extremely sharp and contrasty. The maximum aperture gives it excellent performance in low light and indoors. The optical performance puts it on par with the larger FG 80mm f/1.9 (review). When shooting on the street, this is one of the best ultra-wide lenses I have used.

Here’s some sample images I shot using this lens on the Fujifilm X-T2. All images were shot at f/1.4 with the XF 27mm f/2.8 M.

This camera is really good, I love this 35mm lense and the build of the camera.

Excellent lens for a 35mm. No complaints. For some reason I really don’t like my camera because it says Nikon. It’s still just as good as I have been very happy with what i’m getting out of it.

John Delaney

Seth, I agree. I had a D610 for a long time and just recently got the X-T2. The build quality of the X-T2 seems to be way better. My 5DMkIII is getting a lot more use since I’m now shooting on it and want to test the FG lenses. Once I test the 85mm 1.8 then I’ll be ready to pick up an X-T2 body to move all my Nikon gear over.

Kurt S.

Just bought this lens. I haven’t got to spend much time with it yet. Hope it’s as good as the one review said it was. I have to admit that I am a Canon user but this one lens just had me sold.

John Delaney

Kurt, I agree. It will be interesting to see how good it really is with the X-T2.

Brian Mackey

Just got this great lense, and can not wait to shoot it. Thanks for all of your reviews, this has helped me so much.

John Delaney

Brian, it’s such a great lens. I’ve never been more happy with a Fujifilm lens.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:30
