generate an image from a number."
This process has become increasingly useful in 
creating a digital portrait of what will be an 
important number for us in the next section.
As we'll see, the Golden Ratio has long played 
a critical role in the construction of many 
masterworks in art, music, design, architecture, 
and even nature itself.
But it turns out that we're not the first to think 
of the Golden Ratio as a key to the best possible 
design of a building.
Historians believe that Vitruvius used it during 
the construction of the Roman Pantheon in 
nearly 25 B.C., and it appears in architecture 
and art as far back as the third century B.C.
The Golden Ratio makes its first appearance in 
Western art in the 15th century.
Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci is credited with 
introducing the Golden Ratio into Western art.
He would use it to create his masterpieces, 
including the Mona Lisa, the Madonna and Child, 
and The Last Supper, all of which are considered 
pinnacles of the Western art tradition.
Leonardo's knowledge of perspective enabled him 
to use the Golden Ratio in order to make the 
perspective of his images more natural, which in 
turn contributed to the way people viewed 
the world around them.
Over the centuries, the Golden Ratio became an 
icon for proportion in Western art, and was used 
throughout the Renaissance and into the 20th 
century.
For the remainder of this lesson, we'll study the 
most fundamental property of the Golden Ratio, 
its beauty, and then explore the importance of 
this property in a variety of ancient disciplines.
To create a beautiful image, we need two distinct 
properties.
To begin, we want an aesthetic element.
To create an image with beauty, we must balance 
proportions so that the Golden Ratio is 
present in both axes of a given image.
Here, we have a beautiful portrait of 
Cindy Crawford.
We see that the Golden Ratio, along with the 
other geometric properties of this image are 
balanced.
The height and width of the image are both 
exactly 2 times the Golden Ratio, or 2 to the 
Golden Ratio.
In contrast, this is not a beautiful image.
The Golden Ratio is present in one dimension, but 
not in the other, so the Golden Ratio is only 
part of the equation.
I've illustrated the four possible axes of any 
given image.
In the first image, we can see that the Golden 
Ratio is present only in the left-right axis of 
the image.
This means that the top and bottom of the image 
are not in perfect equilibrium, so the Golden 
Ratio is not present in the height and width 
dimensions of this image.
This is a good way to notice when you see 
something that has the Golden Ratio on one 
axis but not the other.
Because an image has a single orientation, 
we can represent the Golden Ratio only by two 
equations, one that defines the top and bottom, 
and the other that defines the right and left 
of the image.
The Golden Ratio has several properties of its 
own, but the most important is this.
When we place the Golden Ratio on the left and 
right of an image, the height equals the width.
We call this equality of the height to width the 
"equality of parts."
In this example, the proportion that describes 
the left and right sides of the image is the 
Golden Ratio itself.
While we can study the Golden Ratio by itself, 
the beauty of this ratio is enhanced by its 
combination with other proportions.
The Golden Ratio has many such 
combinations in nature.
Some of the most compelling and inspiring 
combinations are found in nature.
The Golden Ratio can be placed on many different 
sectors of a given image.
We use these combinations of the Golden Ratio to 
create beauty in a range of art forms, including 
architecture, painting, music, and other 
visual forms.
While there is much beauty in the natural world, 
we have a special fondness for the Golden Ratio 
in music.
Here are two famous songs that are well-known 
for their Golden Ratio.
Both of these songs are so well known for 
their perfect beauty that I'm sure many of you 
could sing them from memory.
On the left is Dido's, "Here is a portrait of 
my love."
On the right is David Bowie's "Sound and Vision," 
the first of a dozen albums that contain 
proportional values of the Golden Ratio.
These proportions are most evident in David 
Bowie's album title, which references two 
different ideas.
The first, "sound," refers to the song's 
lyrical themes.
This song, at times called "The Laser Man," 
featured unusual chord sequences and rhythm.
Its rhythm patterns are influenced by jazz.
The second idea, "vision," refers to the 
songs featured in this album.
David Bowie's musical influences included 
everything from the Beach Boys, to the Beatles, 
to Kraftwerk, to the Velvet Underground, and 
even the Japanese electronic band Yellow Magic 
Orchestra.
David Bowie was inspired by Japan's pop culture 
and the way Japanese teenagers use the ratio 
in fashion, design, and music.
Since we've taken a look at the Golden Ratio as a 
mathematical concept in art and music, let's 
take a look at some of the most beautiful 
architectural structures in history that were 
designed using the Golden Ratio.
Here we have some of the most iconic structures 
in Western history, including the Pantheon 
and the Duomo in Florence, Italy, and St. Paul's 
Cathedral in London.
As you can see, the Golden Ratio is present in 
all three of these masterworks.
The Pantheon and the Duomo both were 
designed using the Golden Ratio, as well as a 
beautiful ratio called the "divine proportion," 
which has fascinated artists and architects for 
centuries.
In fact, it is one of the oldest ratios still in 
use by modern architects and designers.
The divine proportion has fascinated many of 
the great minds in art.
For example, in the 1500s, this ratio was 
celebrated by the 16th century artist and 
architect Andrea Palladio.
This relationship, when placed between the 
divine and the Golden Ratio, is known as the 
"divine Golden Ratio," or the "divine 
proportions."
The divine proportion is the golden ratio of 1.618.
While other proportions, such as the Golden 
Ratio, can be demonstrated on multiple axes, 
and can be displayed on straight lines or 
curved lines, the divine proportion only works 
on curved lines.
Why is the divine proportion so powerful?
I think the reason is obvious when you look at 
the image above, which illustrates the power of 
the divine proportions in a single line.
And, unlike the Golden Ratio, which 
consists of two numbers that are not whole 
numbers, the divine proportion consists of 
whole numbers that are expressed as fractions.
The lengths of a and c and the diameter of the 
circle are all in the ratio of 1.618 to 1.
This is the golden ratio, and the ratio between 
a and c has the same value as the radius of the 
circle.
The relationship between the divine proportions 
is so tight and so compelling that it has 
a unique quality about it.
Every other ratio that we've examined 
includes two number that are a little bit off 
from 1, but the divine proportion uses two 
whole numbers.
Because these numbers are whole numbers, this 
means that the divine proportion exists not 
just on curved lines, but also on straight lines, 
allowing us to see the beauty of the divine 
proportion in everything from buildings, to 
crystals, to the human body.
While there is much beauty in nature, there 
are many other fascinating properties of the 
Golden Ratio in art, music, mathematics, and 
nature that have been studied and celebrated.
Let's take a look at some of the most 
powerful and interesting uses of the Golden 
Ratio.
In 15th century Persia, mathematicians 
discovered that the Golden Ratio can be used 
to find a sequence of squares that are the most 
beautiful, as well as a sequence of cubes that 
also add up to the square of the most beautiful 
number.
This ratio was first discovered in music when 
German composer Pythagoras and music 
theorist Johann Faulhaber were both searching 
for a way</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:04
