"It's part of the plan." "I mean, look, if she stays the way she is, she's gonna die in a few days." "Look, that's not the point." "Her brain is still alive, but it's been cut off from the world." "And you can give it another 30 years of loneliness?" "That's gonna kill her." "I'm not gonna let that happen." "That's all there is to it." "You know, these things have short lives, ten years, maybe 15." "They're designed to function just enough to procreate and then die." "Look, we've kept them alive way beyond what they were designed for, but at a cost, you know?" "I mean, look at them." "They're deformed and dysfunctional." "Sure, they're a little pathetic, but that's because they were born in captivity and have never been allowed to live free and wild, and so they're psychologically stunted." "Are you saying you feel sorry for them?" "Yeah, I guess so, in a way, but that's not the point." "Look, I mean, come on, we're the ones who made them this way, you know?" "They're just a little bonus for us." "So, what do you want me to do?" "We need a donor." "What does that mean?" "Like a live donor?" "Yes, that's right." "So, why don't you just grab a couple of your rich friends and ask them for a kidney?" "That wouldn't work." "What about one of those people who need one and they're willing to sell theirs?" "They don't exist." "Sure, they do." "There are all kinds of them." "You just have to look for them." "I can't do that." "No, we have to be careful." "Why?" "There are certain government agencies that frown on that sort of activity." "What government agencies?" "The ones that Congress created to watch the government itself." "Jesus!" "Come on, man, you should at least think about it." "No." "Look, it doesn't matter anyway." "She's probably not gonna last the week." "Oh, well, then, you figure it out." "I mean, all you're doing is playing with her future anyway." "All right, look, I'll see what I can do." "Thanks." "I appreciate it." "Hey, I gotta get back to work." "Come on, man." "We're just talking here." "Hey, just keep me in the loop." "Thanks." "So what you doing tonight?" "Mike's gonna be home late." "You wanna go get a drink?" "Nah, I can't." "Sorry." "Oh, come on, man, just one drink." "It's nothing." "All right, what are you doing after?" "Um, nothing." "What time is it?" "It's, like, 10:00 or something." "We should call it a night." "You know, it's Friday night." "Dex, the shit's gonna hit the fan on a Friday night." "Mike can handle it." "Yeah, well, what if he can't?" "What happens then?" "It's not like it's just you out there." "It's me and you and him, and I don't want anything to go wrong." "Listen, you've done a good thing here." "But I don't have a job." "You're gonna find something." "The economy is booming right now, okay?" "There's a lot of jobs out there." "Maybe you're the one to figure out what to do with this stuff." "Yeah, maybe." "Do me a favor, though, will you?" "Yeah." "Don't go looking for a job." "Let Mike handle that." "He's the cop." "Yeah, I know." "I know." "Look, I'm sorry." "I'm gonna go." "I'll see you later, okay?" "I don't want to stay." "I know." "I know, buddy." "It's okay." "Do me a favor." "Go on in the house and have a drink." "I can handle this." "All right?" "All right?" "Go on in the house, okay?" "I'm sorry, bro." "Hello?" "Yeah." "I got a package here for you." "The address is on the front." "Yeah." "Uh-huh." "I got it." "Okay." "Just sign right here at the X." "No problem." "Thanks a lot." "Sorry about that." "What's in the package?" "Is it a gift?" "Yeah." "It's a carving." "Hey, Dexter." "Dexter!" "Dex!" "Come on, you son of a..." "Hey." "Where the hell are you, you bastard?" "All right." "Yeah, you either need to get your ass out here... or I'm gonna come over there and show this thing to you, pal!" "I got a knife, motherfucker!" "Yeah?" "What you got in your hand?" "It's a carving." "I see that." "Hey!" "All right!" "I'll be over there in a second, all right?" "Dexter." "Are you out of your mind?" "What are you doing?" "Hey, babe." "This is Dexter." "I think he's drunk again." "Yeah." "No, I was just wondering if you're coming home tonight." "Uh..." "I don't know." "We'll see." "We'll see." "Okay, bye." "This isn't funny, Dexter." "You can't just stay out all night, especially not tonight." "I'll be right there." "There's a... knife in my bag." " I know." " All right, then." "I'm coming." "Bye." "I love you." "Yeah, me, too." "I gotta get ready for work." "You know how much I like to watch you go off to work... in your pretty blue suit?" "No, seriously." "You look good." "Hey, Dexter!" "Dexter!" "Have a good day at work, bro!" "Yeah, you, too." "Morning, Dexter." " Hey, Joey." " Hey." "I'm just bringing in your paper." "Don't forget that package I left on your desk." "Oh, yeah." "No problem." "Hey, you want me to get that?" "No, it's okay." "I got it." "Hey, babe." "I totally forgot to tell you something." "It was so last night." "I bumped into Nina at the grocery store, and she asked me if I was going home tonight." "I said no." "You said no?" "Yeah." "Is that okay?" "I don't know, I..." "I didn't think it was that big a deal." "Anyway, Nina really wants you to come, and I told her you were busy." "Busy?" "What do you mean, busy?" "I'm not doing anything." "I'm just gonna sleep." "You know what?" "I'll bring home leftovers from The Spaghetti Shack." " Really?" " Sure, yeah." " That'd be great." " All right, great." "Hey, um..." "Could you do me a favor?" "Yeah, sure." "Could you not mention this to Harrison, because..." "Because he got really mad at me last time I bumped into Nina at the grocery store, and I don't want him to do something like that to her." "Okay, sure." "I can do that." "Thanks." "I really appreciate it." "No, it's okay." "See you tonight." "Okay." "Bye, Joey." "Thanks." "No, of course, they're in the conference room." "Okay." "So is the family getting along okay?" "Yeah, so far so good." "I'm headed over there right now." "Everything okay?" "Well, Deb's upset because her ex-husband won't give her son a kidney." "What a jerk!" "Why can't he just do it?" "Lack of insurance, maybe?" "Well, does he have to be so cheap?" "Uh, that's actually why I'm calling." "I may be way out of line here, but it seems that she may be having an affair." "What?" "How would you know that?" "I don't know." "I'm sensing it." "I can always tell." "And you don't want to tell her?" "She'll kill the messenger." "There's a lot of them out there." "And I just think that she should hear it from you." "That's all." "Yeah, I know, I know." "I know how you feel." "You're right." "I'll tell her." "Okay, thanks." "I gotta go, okay?" "Everything okay?" "Debra, you have a phone call." "Hello?" "Dexter, this is Debra." "You have a phone call." "From who?" "Your children." "Would you like me to tell them you're indisposed?" "Deb, it's the hospital." "They need</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:44
