Aaron Baker was found guilty of wounding with intent to do GBH.

Baker, 31, approached the transgender woman and her boyfriend, and asked them to go back to her flat with her and smoke cannabis, Exeter Crown Court was told.

However, when Baker became aggressive, the pair decided to go home.

The transgender woman claims Baker shouted: "You're going home in a coffin tonight."

When her boyfriend began to walk home, Baker walked towards him before pulling out a knife and swinging it, the court heard.

She stabbed his arm and left forearm before telling the couple: "I’ll cut your b***** off."

When officers arrived, Baker was found hiding in bushes.

The officer said: "I’ve got her, you’re b***** off tonight," according to prosecutor Emma Jones.

A doctor also told the court Baker was agitated and emotional and a full psychiatric report was carried out to determine if she was fit to plead and if she was mentally ill.

Baker also faces charges of racially-aggravated harassment, assault and theft, as well as common assault and possessing cannabis, the court heard.

Baker will be sentenced on November 5, when a number of other charges are due to be decided.

"This was a terrifying experience for the victim, who had never experienced anything like this before.

"Thankfully the victim did not sustain any serious injury.

"I would like to thank the police officers who dealt with the matter swiftly.

"However, as the offender had a knife and was obviously in a fit of temper, it’s good that someone has been convicted of these offences."
