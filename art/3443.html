1994, the City of Pensacola 
and Escambia County
joined forces in an ambitious capital improvement program.
The public-private partnership is now widely regarded as a model of 
successful public-private 
partnership.
But not everyone agreed back then. 
Those who 
did not approve of the plan felt,
as one speaker said at the hearing, 
"like we're being pushed into an old age home."
These naysayers are in good company,
as many Americans feel that way today.
Now we need to take their perspectives into consideration, 
and find common ground
while working together to solve our most pressing 
problems.
If we can successfully pull this off, the end result could help 
shape
a stronger Florida for generations to come.
Because the best way to strengthen a community is to 
get people working together.
And the best way to get people working together 
is to get them listening
to each other.
I've seen that.
And I believe it's the same idea our framers 
had in mind.
So, my friends, let us talk more often and listen better.
The next great idea 
can only be found in 
the great conversations 
of our people.
Thank you.
My fellow citizens,
I ask you to recognize the extraordinary 
people in this room.
I'd like you to picture 
the future of 
Florida.
I'd like you to imagine a world 
where we can work together 
to create the jobs and 
the opportunities
of which we can each dream.
I'd like you to imagine that future,
and then dream bigger, 
because together we can achieve 
even more.
Today, we're going to focus on
public 
private partnerships.
The strength of our economy lies 
in our ability to innovate.
We need the knowledge, expertise and innovation of 
our private sector.
We need the risk-taking of our entrepreneurs, 
and we need the dedication of our workforce.
Our public and private sectors
have a significant role to play 
in making Florida great again.
Let's begin with transportation, 
where our innovative entrepreneurs can leverage 
local resources and build 
economic opportunities for 
all Florida 
through job creation.
Let's consider this. 
Florida's transportation agency has a plan 
to improve 
the safety of 
our roads 
and highways,
that are in need of repair.
If we're going to have an 
engine of growth,
this is the time to act.
Let's improve Florida's infrastructure, 
to make our state a hub for 
economic opportunity.
As we make our transportation system 
smarter, stronger and safer,
we will provide Florida's workers with 
the mobility 
and freedom to move to job-creating areas.
Let's keep our 
economy moving forward, while strengthening 
and safeguarding our safety.
I am pleased to announce that state 
senator Tom Lee and Congressman Neal Dunn are joining us 
in a partnership
to build consensus around road safety, 
and the future of our transportation system.
I also want to make sure all of our 
communities and residents are involved in making Florida great again.
Let's work together 
to create the vibrant, competitive 
economies 
we want to see.
I am a firm believer that economic 
development and job creation are not an 
either/or situation.
If we want to strengthen our economy,
we need to improve both infrastructure and public safety.
This is what Florida wants, 
and this is what we have to give.
Now I'd like to hear your thoughts and ideas.
What do we need to do to make Florida great again?
It's important to remember that public-private partnerships are a form of public policy. 
So, it's up to us
to make sure that policy is good 
for the people of Florida.
And I know many of you are ready to 
roll up your sleeves.
Let's listen to each other.
Our vision is shared by many.
Let's help bring 
our community together, and make Florida 
as great as it can be.
Thank you, 
God bless the 
United States of America,
and God bless the great state of Florida.
And now, let's get to work.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We have come a long way together, 
and when we get through 
this together, 
we will have never, ever forgotten
what you have done 
for our country.
We will not forget, and now 
I am going to turn it over to our friends from the 
Corporation of 
The City of New York.

My fellow citizens,
and distinguished guests,
New Yorkers will be glad to know 
there are many others who think of us today
as we celebrate 
Emancipation Day in New York.
This great city was born from two great minds.
It was born from a single idea: 
let us make this earth 
a better place.
And I am deeply honored to stand in the presence of our forefathers today,
and in the presence of our fellow 
citizens, our leaders, our heroes, and
those that sacrifice so selflessly to keep us all safe.
Over the last several years, we have weathered a few storms that have tested our national character.
Whether it's our response to the worst natural disaster in our country's history, 
which devastated our state.
Or those trying times 
when we're called upon to make a decision that,
while it was hard and painful, was absolutely right.
I was humbled to work with the President on his visit to New York City, 
while 9/11 is still as vivid as it was that day in 2001.
For every American, 
this nation and New York is a source of pride,
of national memory, 
of patriotism. 
New Yorkers and Americans have been tested.
We continue to go forward to make sure that this nation is strong, 
that America's core values will be the guiding principles of our society.
In New York, that's the core value of freedom.
That's the core value of liberty.
Those are the core values of the founding fathers 
who started this great nation, 
the core values that have been reinforced by the blood of our veterans, 
the sacrifice of our</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:15
