of the blue eyes of love being in
our heads, it was a storm 
of fire and flame.
Bright and hot tongues of 
flame jumped from the eyes, 
searing the skull to reveal a 
ghostly skull with two eyes 
and a small, perfect mouth.
I was too entranced to scream.
A low voice echoed from the 
dead, burning skull, and the
voice belonged to an infant 
that should have been a 
child.
“You 
will do as you are told. You will
find your husband and wife 
and 
kill them and you will find 
the 
pagan girl and sacrifice her.”
A flash of anger hit the 
creature of fire, and the
eyes flared with an 
evil red.
A loud, angry shout came from 
the creature, and it 
seemed to spit at us.
The fire flared again and left 
a black imprint on the eyes.
We both fell back to our
respective knees and gasped.
I could hear the creature laugh
behind us.
A loud ‘Aah’ escaped through
the flames and filled the 
darkness.
Then I felt fingers 
pulling the spellbook out of 
my hands.
The next thing I knew the world 
and we were flying through 
the air.
The 
thunder and lightning faded and 
the rain fell around us.
We floated several hundred 
feet in the air, being 
carried by a cyclone of 
air that whirled us around.
Everything was a green-gray 
black, but then a blinding 
white light shone around us.
The cyclone 
ceased and I found myself on the 
ground beside my sleeping bag,
the book still in my hand.
The night 
was as silent as it had been 
before. 
It was 
as if 
the noise of thunder had 
never happened.
I looked at the book. A few 
tiny tears formed in the pages 
at the places where the 
spell had damaged it.
I shivered, and my breath 
fluttered from my lips as if I
was about to cry.
The wind 
howled in my ears. My eyes 
burned with tears and water. I
didn’t know what 
happened, and the words of the
spell didn’t seem to be able 
to make up for what 
happened.
I didn’t know what to think.
I wanted to go back to the
last minute in time where 
everything was normal.
I hadn’t asked to see the 
shadows of the dead. The 
shadows were trying to tell me 
something that I didn’t get.
At the same time, I wanted to 
go back to the night when the
old woman was telling the 
story of the magic in the book.
I couldn’t understand it. Why 
would a book be the key to 
life and death?
Why would the dead have 
secrets that could affect us?
If the eyes of love were in our
head, why did we hurt so much?
If the book didn’t have 
powers, then why did it make 
things so violent?
I sat up and let out a scream. 
A shadow had fallen over me.
It was a tall, thin shadow 
that was as big as my foot and 
was in the shape of a human.
I tried to back up, but the 
shadow stepped in my way.
I turned around and 
everything in the world went 
still.
The rain stopped. 
The sound of the night was gone. 
There was nothing except the 
dark shadows of the dead.
“Why have the shadows of the 
dead come to me?”
I asked.
I heard only a soft laughter 
behind me. The shape of the 
shadow melted away. 
The air 
around me seemed to swirl and 
pull into the shape of an 
invisible hand. 
It wrapped around my wrist 
and pulled me into the 
shadow. 
Everything went black and
silent as the wind stopped 
whistling.
As the darkness 
faded, I found myself sitting in
a 
chair. 
It was a cozy chair, with warm 
red walls and a wooden floor. 
There was a fire in the 
corner of the room. 
On the far wall of the room 
was a dresser.
There was a mirror 
on the wall above it. The mirror
was covered by a small painting
of a woman. 
The woman in the painting was 
beautiful.
The painting was a portrait 
of my mother.
The reflection in the mirror 
was the exact copy of her face 
and the way she moved.
My heart was pounding. I was 
trembling and couldn’t control
myself.
I stood up and walked 
towards the mirror.
My reflection sat.
My hair hung on my face. It
was a mess.
My eyes were dark. 
My skin was pale.
I looked like a ghost.
I looked like the dead.
The dead looked in the mirror 
and stared.
I didn’t know what was real. I
looked at my fingers, and they 
were pale and thin.
My hand touched the mirror.
The 
surface gave slightly and I
felt wetness on my hand. I 
looked down at my hand and saw
red blood splattered on it.
It wasn’t real, and neither was 
the mirror.
I looked at the image of 
myself on the wall, and I tried 
to touch the mirror again. 
My hand did not pass through.
I looked closer and discovered 
a small cut on my face. 
There was a wet red mark on 
my cheek, and a drop of blood 
seeped through.
A tear ran down my face and 
climbed to my chin. 
My head started to feel 
weird. My eyes started to hurt.
They burned. The room 
started to spin.
I screamed and the wind started 
to blow. 
I ran away from the 
fireplace.
It started to warm up and 
become weaker.
The wind rose around me. 
The mirror broke as a gust 
passed through it.
A shadowy hand reached out 
and grabbed me.
The cold was numbing. 
I could see it in the shape of 
the hand in front of me.
I wanted to be away from it, 
but I couldn’t escape.
It grabbed my arm and 
threw me towards 
the wall. 
It was hard to see what was 
happening in the shadows, 
but I saw its eyes flash 
green. 
It was killing me.
I felt my breath being taken 
away, and I lost my energy.
It stopped, and I collapsed on 
the ground. 
My vision started to blur. 
There was a moment of 
darkness. 
Then I heard a 
splattering sound. 
I blinked. 
I saw the shadow move towards 
me. 
Its eyes were burning green. 
It picked me up and lifted me 
into the air. 
I screamed and screamed for it 
to let me go, but it didn’t.
It flung me against the wall 
and I saw red.
I was falling to the ground. 
My eyesight was blurred and 
everything looked like it was 
moving slowly. 
I could see the shadow walk 
towards me.
The glass in the mirror 
shattered.
There was nothing that would 
save me.
The shadow took one last look 
at me.
It disappeared. 
I fell to the ground. 
I wanted to die. 
The red mist grew thicker.
There was no way out. 
My heart started to beat more 
and more quickly. 
The pain was becoming worse.
I wanted to die.
I looked at the glass that had 
broken. 
It was red with my blood.
I wanted to die.
I tried to die.
I fell into a deep sleep. 
It was peaceful.
It took away all of my pain, and
the wind stopped, the rain 
stopped, and the night ended. 
Everything seemed to return to 
the way it was before.
When I woke up, I could tell 
that it was day time.
The sun was bright and 
brilliant.
The sky was still a brilliant 
purple. 
The grass was green and the 
air was calm.
I got up and saw the glass </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:16
