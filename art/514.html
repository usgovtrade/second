? As announced in our e-mail on July 21, we have started discussions with 
our technology partners about a number of possible IT solutions.  We are in 
mid- to late-stages discussions with vendors to eliminate potential 
barriers to the technology partnerships and are making good progress.  We 
have also started testing the first set of prototypes of these IT

financial performance. 
 
Please let us know if you have any questions.

Further to Klaus' presentation today, there are a few follow-up questions:

Will the functionality from the existing workflow applications be
transferred to the new IT infrastructure, or is there some sort of
investment in the development of workflow functionality specific to the
new architecture?

Will the scope of this investment be limited to Worklife, or will the
scope be expanded to include other applications?

What is the timeframe for implementation? It's been rumored that
implementation will begin in 2002, but I haven't heard a specific
announcement regarding implementation timeframes.

The last bullet above suggests that there is a large amount of
workflow functionality within Worklife. What is the estimated
percentage of worklife transactions which utilize workflow?

Is the Worklife transaction functionality currently utilizing the
capacity on the existing infrastructure, and, if so, how does the
forecasted roll-out of the IT infrastructure support additional
workflow processing?

What is the implementation timeframe for financial trading
workflow?

Thanks,
David

Subject: Workflow and other  following-up

There were several questions that came up during today's discussion on our 
options for dealing with the WorkFlow/EnTelligence tool.  These are the 
initial options as I understand them:

Option 1 - No action - do nothing and let Milnthorp and his team sort out the 
contractual issues.  The risks here are that we have no perceived need/use 
for the tool (and we are locked into only one vendor) and that we have a 
potential $10Million expenditure with Milnthorp at a time when we are trying 
to minimize expenses.

Option 2 - Terminate for $1 - obtain a one year license from the current 
vendor, PeopleBank, terminate the current agreement and allow the current 
vendor to complete the WorkFlow project in its current form.  The risks here 
are that we terminate an agreement with a vendor in the middle of a project 
that may have lower switching costs, that the new product is perceived as a 
disappointment (due to our involvement) and that there is a perceived 
$10Million expenditure at a time when Milnthorp is focused on cost 
cutting/opportunities to reduce expenditures.

Option 3 - Terminate for $2 - Terminate the agreement and obtain a two year 
license from the new vendor, PeopleBank. This option assumes that we have the 
ability to negotiate an arrangement with PeopleBank to minimize our payment 
and therefore we have no $ risk. The risk with this option is that we have no 
WorkFlow/EnTelligence product for one or two years. I assume that PeopleBank 
will allow us to roll the current WorkFlow project over into the product 
that they will develop for us for a one time payment. The upside of this 
option is that we are able to minimize the costs to Enron by leveraging 
PeopleBank's product development capabilities. 

The group is still considering all the options and I will continue to 
reiterate the risks of the different options. Please direct any questions or 
requests for additional information to myself at 713 853 3174.
