"We’ve set up ‘Satisfaction to Win' rather than ‘Satisfaction to Win Later’ because we want people to win instantly. The longer people spend at the site, the greater chance they have of winning, but if they're playing to win now, we want to ensure they do just that, and in that way get to experience the winning feeling," said the team in a blog post.

Gamespot's New App

The "Satisfaction to Win" feature works through a special kind of advertising: a new in-app purchase called Instant Win. You'll need to pay $2.99 to play the game, and it will earn you an instant win ticket every 20 seconds.

Winning an Instant Win can unlock another prize, which itself will give you instant wins every 20 seconds, so it's sort of like a prize chain where you move from a ticket to the next in a row. And that's how the whole lot of prizes will be unlocked: you'll need 20 tickets to move from level to level.

It doesn't have to be this complicated, of course, as there are alternative methods of unlocking these prizes if you don't have the Instant Win bundle. There's also a handy rewards chart that explains all your options, and this is the section that seems to attract the most attention in the game.

In the "Satisfaction to Win" version of Gamespot, prizes and offers are replaced by a "Reward for Participation" section. A large banner is displayed on screen (see image above), and is displayed with all offers and prizes, but these prizes are not actually attainable with the Instant Win bundle.

In fact, there is a new Achievement system which is used to create your own in-app rewards. A banner on the top of the screen displays your status as a winner, and if you have earned some points, you'll be presented with a list of all games and rewards that have earned the most participation and points.

These in-game rewards can be unlocked at any time, and include an early access ticket to a game, or to sign up for a newsletter, the chance to win exclusive prizes or even a chance to have your own app featured as the "Winner's Reward" that other players can win in the future.

New Gamespot Mobile App

One other thing that's unique about this mobile version of the Gamespot website is the Gamespot Mobile Ad Platform, which will be used to introduce new advertisers to the mobile market. We haven't seen these ads in the desktop version yet, so we can't confirm if they're just new features for the mobile version of the site, or if we'll see them here in the near future.

For now, here's a screen of the mobile version of Gamespot, followed by a video.
