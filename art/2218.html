We know you would be tempted to post your video, your love song, your kiss on the “what I would like to see on a site such as ours” page, right? I was too until I actually did it and realized that there is a more subtle, un-public place on our site to do so.

We wanted to give our members a very simple way to put an extra “special” touch on their listing that didn’t seem “tacky” so we created a special spot called My Profile Page, found on the My Property tab.

The “My Profile Page” is reserved for users to write something very special about themselves, but also as an area that is very private and only viewable by members. We don’t encourage users to write long, detailed accounts about themselves as it could come off as very self-involved. If your page doesn’t grab the right eyeball it can be very off putting.

When you write something on your profile page it gives people who look at the listing even more reasons to think about you before they sign up.

The beauty is that this is completely optional and can be left blank if you don’t want to write anything extra or you don’t have anything to say.

If you want to write something just add something like this:

Hi, my name is [your name here] and I love dogs! I am looking for a roommate who loves animals just as much as me. There is always a pet at the house! My Profile Page:http://www.animalRoomMate.com/Jennie1

You can sign up for a membership to be notified by email when we have more listings that might fit your needs.

It’s that easy! If you are looking for a roommate or you know someone that might, check out http://www.animalRoomMate.com today!

This is definitely a good place to advertise because it lets potential roommates see what you’re really looking for (if that is what you want people to know). My girlfriend actually posted a link to this site on craigslist and has gotten her share of replies. She got back at least one, if not two, actual potential roommates who are already living together who would be happy to share the rent. She ended up not having the need for them, but it’s still a good idea.

My roommate is moving out, and if someone can’t let her new room until I am done moving next week, I will be paying the full rent. I would prefer to rent my old room until my new roommate gets here, but if no one wants to share, I will try to find a “real” roommate.

Hi Jennie, The new home owner is allowed to “sell” their old home before moving in. I would be happy to have your friend stay with me and in no time you can have the room for yourself once she leaves. However, if you are looking for a new roommate, it might be better to keep the room for yourself if you are moving. Even if you will be moving into a small apartment, you will need a lot of storage space and a bathroom. If you are planning to get a larger place, be sure to leave enough space for one person so that you can share bathroom space with whoever you may end up moving in. Let me know how that turns out! Please let me know if I can be of any help.

I searched for more than a year in the newspaper and websites, and found nothing. I wanted a roommate for 2 months, not a one-year lease. Thanks to your site, I got not only a roommate, but a really awesome person. I now have a very interesting and nice female roommate who I have learned about a lot of things in just 1 month. Thank you so much!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:09
