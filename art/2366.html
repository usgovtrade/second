What we want to do
is we're gonna
use the same method
we used to create it.
I want to begin by
selecting
right click on my
background.
And hit
"New."
And so what I want to do
is create a texture.
And to do that,
I'm going to go up here to
the toolbar, and I'm going to
select "image."
So I'm going to load my PNG.
And the easiest way
to do that is
just to select
file, and drag your image file.
So I'm gonna load my image.
And if we scroll down,
we can see the different options.
Now, before I get started,
what I want to do is we're gonna
create our image set.
And you want to do that,
so that way we can save the PNG.
And you don't want to do that,
because you want
to go ahead and make
your animations.
So to do that, what we want to do
is we're gonna click "Open."
And now we have this option,
"New Texture."
And if we go ahead and save
this image set.
Now that's saved.
Let's go ahead and create our
sprite sheet.
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a new sprite
sheet with a frame
count of one.
And you'll notice this number
here, this is the sheet size.
You can also just use the
number right here.
But I recommend using this if
you want to export to something
like a video format.
Okay, so let's make a sprite
sheet with a sheet size
of 1280 by 720.
Click "OK." Now I'm going to
start animating the sprite sheet.
And I'm going to load in
the number plate for our bike.
So I've got this image
here on the left.
And I want to just animate
it around that image.
And so this is how I want it.
It's starting at left edge.
You can see the texture's
getting bigger.
And then it's going
down here, and it's gonna come
to the right edge.
And so now that I have
it positioned here,
I'm gonna select the image,
but I'm going to right click,
and I'm going to "Paste in Front."
So we now have the same
image in front.
And I'm gonna rotate
it a little bit.
So I'm gonna select "Rotate."
And I'm gonna go ahead and
rotate it a little bit.
I'll go ahead and right click,
and I'm going to "Paste in Front."
Okay, so that's what
we did in order
to get the texture
to move like that.
We're gonna do the exact same
thing, except we're gonna move it
from left edge to right edge.
So if we right click,
we're gonna go up here to "Copy,"
and this is "Paste In Front."
And now I'm going to go
up here, and I'm gonna select
"Transform."
And I'm gonna go ahead and
rotate this around the y axis.
So if we scroll down
to the last two settings.
So we want to select "Pivot,"
and just change this from "none."
So it's gonna be over our bike.
And then we'll go ahead
and just "transform."
And then we'll hit "OK," and we'll
go back up to the top right.
And it's going to animate.
We're gonna go ahead and just
animate it again the same way.
So if we go
to our playhead.
Now, what I want to do is
we're gonna just make one minor
change to this animation.
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to select this.
I'm going to scroll
down to "Opacity."
And what we're gonna do is
we're gonna increase this value.
So let's go ahead
and increase it to two.
And then it's gonna blend in,
and the plate's not gonna be there.
And I'm just gonna apply
it like that.
And now what we can do is we can
add some animation to this.
And to do that, we're just
going to select "Time,"
and then we're going to drag this.
And now what I want to do is I want
to have it be a little longer.
So I'm gonna increase it to 100.
And then the image is
gonna go from left to right.
And now if I drag
this to the right,
it's gonna get smaller.
And I can decrease the speed
here, if I want to.
I don't want it to move
quite so fast.
And I'm just going to right click,
and I'm gonna "Undo."
So now, if I right click, and
we go up to "Image,"
we're going to click "Rename."
And we're going to rename this
"Speed Texture."
Now I'm gonna rename this "Image 1."
And if we scroll down,
and we go to our playhead,
you can see that's basically
how the animation looks.
Now, what I want to do is
we're gonna have one more set.
So we're gonna create another
sprite sheet, but we're gonna
create it with a frame count of 10.
So I'm gonna go
ahead and save that.
And then we're going to do
the same thing, but we're going
to just create another texture.
And so, again, we're
just gonna repeat
what we just did
to create another.
So we're going to make the same
image, save it, and apply the same
animation to it, except
we're gonna offset it.
So here is one.
And we're gonna have the next one.
And I want to align this so
it kind of starts here.
So I'm going to "Time," and then
I'm going to add another row,
so the time is gonna go down,
and it's gonna go back up.
And now, if I go over here, and
I look at the layers in "Layers."
I'm gonna create this.
And I'm gonna make the
width and the height,
but I'm going to scale it down
a little bit because I want it to
be a little bit smaller.
And so we're gonna go ahead and
do that, and then I'm gonna click
"Scale."
And you can see that's working.
And now I want to select
"Time," and I'm going to rotate it
around the y axis, so
we can see the texture.
Okay, so that's the texture.
Now what we're gonna do
is what we just created,
which is the main texture.
We're going to save
that as well.
So let's go ahead and do that.
And now we're going to have a
sprite sheet that looks like this.
But now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna duplicate this, and
we're gonna invert it.
So let's go ahead and
duplicate it.
And let's go ahead and invert it.
So I'm gonna right click,
and I'm gonna "Duplicate,"
and I'm gonna name this.
So now, we have
a second layer here.
And this one I want to invert.
So it's going to change to this.
So I'm going to "Time,"
and I'm gonna create
an animation where I
will have the texture.
So I'll go here, and I'm going
to add another row.
I'm going to make it
from left to right.
So it's going to be on one, and
then two, and then three, and
then four, and then five,
and then six, and then seven,
and then eight.
And I want it to have a
delay between the six and the seven.
So let's just click
here and then let's just
drag this over a little bit.
And I'm gonna copy the animation.
And what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go ahead
and offset this
animation so it goes up,
and then it'll come down,
and then it'll come back up.
So I'm gonna right click here,
and I'm going to "Duplicate."
And I'm going to duplicate that.
And now I want to invert that.
So this one's going to change to
the same thing as that one here.
And what we're gonna do is we're
gonna copy this and invert it,
and then offset this.
So I'm gonna select "Time," and
I'm going to add the animation.
Now this animation has a delay.
And it goes to 1.
And the animation
has a duration of 100.
So now, I'm going to add a frame.
