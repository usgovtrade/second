Jace Toney, 18, was driving his mother's Toyota Corolla and drifted into the opposite lane around 10 a.m. when the vehicle slammed head-on into another driver.



Toney died at the scene, while his mother and two passengers were rushed to the hospital.



The car Toney was driving was rented. A few weeks ago he asked his mom to drive him to an area west of San Antonio to pick up a car for him.



"We've learned that the driver of the other vehicle is also dead," said Sgt. Ryan Hagen with Texas Department of Public Safety. "Now the story has changed, apparently. The story before this was that there was a medical emergency in that vehicle, but there wasn't any medical problems in that vehicle."



The DPS trooper said the accident happened near mile marker 161 near Luling.



"It's an absolute tragedy," said Hagen. "It's a real loss to the community."



The driver of the other vehicle was a 44-year-old man from West Paducah, Ky. The man's family is flying into Texas to pick up his body.



Officials are trying to locate the other driver's family members to notify them of his death.



Family members of Toney are also flying into Texas to meet them in San Antonio.



"You hope in these cases, there's a lesson to be learned," said Hagen. "How did this man reach this point in his life? What could have caused this tragedy?"



The DPS trooper said the drivers of both vehicles were taken to the hospital with injuries that are not life-threatening.



Further details about the accident are not being released at this time.

As they try to find the cause of the accident, Toney's friends and family are still reeling from his death.



"You know, at any point in time, I guess, you know, in any part of this life you can look around, and everything can change," said Lizzie Brinkmeyer. "And a lot of the time we have people that we love that are affected by those things. It's not just tragic for the person that's affected, it's just tragic period."



"Everyone always asks 'Who can we pray for? Who can we pray for?' We can pray for all the families that have been affected by this," said Tammy Taylor. "It's just devastating to lose a child."



"It is hard to hear. And to see all the sadness in everyone's faces because it's sad," said Tiffany Toney.



We have learned that a memorial fund has been set up for the family of the victim. You can donate to the memorial fund at: www.giveforward.com/fund/r3f7l9
