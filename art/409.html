concerned about people being comfortable when around you, especially in 
professional contexts," she wrote in the May 6 memo, obtained by The Times 
under the California Public Records Act. 
A call to Turley's home number was answered by an automatic message 
system. 
Deal's spokesman, Dan Bartlett, said the administration wasn't worried about 
Turley's views. 
"His comments were made in his personal capacity as an academic, not in his 
capacity as a member of the [deregulation] committee," Bartlett said. 
But Turley's memo reflects the same concerns raised by private consultants 
and Republican legislators about the power crisis. 
They complain that the deal will make matters worse by paying less for 
over-priced electricity and that the state is rushing to give money away 
before its residents are ready for the consequences. 
An edited version of the memo was sent to Lawrence Makovich, senior director 
for long-term supply forecasting at the governor's Energy Commission. 
In the memo, which was addressed to top staffers and appeared on a Power 
Exchange long-term forecasting Web page, Turley wrote that the state has 
already spent nearly $5 billion on power and could spend "perhaps as much as 
$50 billion over the coming decades." 
He added, "It is not at all clear that this huge expenditure will turn out to 
have been worth it. On the other hand, having spent so much on electricity, 
California may find that the costs cannot be met, that people do not accept 
that they are priced into darkness, and that the experiment will fail. 
"Californians can only hope that the situation is not so dire. If 
regulators do not act soon, then the lights will go off in many homes and 
companies at the flip of a switch," he wrote. 
The Senate will take up the bill at a special session today at 3 p.m. Gov. 
Gray Davis is expected to sign it. 
It was uncertain which private companies would benefit from the bill's 
provisions that authorize billions of dollars in bonds to pay for past energy 
purchases. 
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said officials from 
the power exchange--the agency that buys electricity on behalf of utilities-- 
will be allowed to sign contracts and pick beneficiaries before July. 
After July, the contracts would be awarded through competitive auctions. 
The measure's passage came as a bitter disappointment for business 
representatives who supported the governor's plan. 
Davis' proposal for the state to purchase the transmission lines of two 
utilities--Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric--has run 
into stiff opposition from lawmakers, consumer advocates and utility 
executives.

GOP stalls Davis' rescue plan in committee 
By Kate Berry
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 10, 2001) 
A rescue plan for SoCal Edison crumbled in a legislative committee Monday, 
but not for lack of trying by Democrats or Republicans. 
Assembly Republicans refused to approve Gov. Gray Davis' plan for a state 
energy reserve and opposed his latest version of a bill that would allow 
SoCal's two troubled utilities to sell their transmission lines to the state 
for more than their book value. 
With their rejection of both measures, Republicans delayed action on the 
pair. The bills go to the Assembly Appropriations Committee today. If adopted 
by the panel, they would go to the Assembly floor. 
But Republicans said they would not vote for Davis' bill. 
"We don't see the need for the state to take over transmission," said Assembly 
Minority Leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks. "There are no national security issues 
here. The governor knows a whole lot more about the power grid than I do, and 
I think he's a little confused about it." 
On the other bill, the Republicans supported it but demanded changes. They 
did not want SoCal Edison to be given $1.5 billion in exchange for the 
transmission lines, which is less than half their book value. They also did 
not like a provision that would raise rates, as much as 47 percent, on 
residents who use more than 130 percent of their baseline electricity use. 
Instead, the Republicans suggested a trust fund be created so the money 
eventually could be returned to customers. They also questioned whether 
returning the transmission lines to the utilities was the best way to keep 
them healthy. 
"If we are going to transfer facilities to a utility, why not just give them 
the cash?" asked Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Northridge. 
Republicans also took issue with Davis' estimate that the state would save as 
much as $8 billion by purchasing the lines. The state would have to spend 
billions just to take over the facilities and may have to pay more to upgrade 
the lines to handle more electricity, Richman said. 
The Democrats' bill, AB8x, will be taken up today by the Assembly Appropriations 
Committee. Lawmakers plan to send it to the Assembly floor next week. It 
provides the framework for negotiations that must take place before a 
three-day energy auction begins July 1. 
Davis announced the framework of a deal in April, saying that the 
Legislature's Democratic leaders agreed to support a plan to buy Edison's 
power lines if a new rate structure is approved for consumers. The plan 
proposed by Davis would charge a fixed price of $78 per thousand square feet 
for the transmission system. 
In response, Assembly Democrats changed the bill so that Edison could keep 
up to 10 percent of the state's purchases if they occur between July 1 and 
Sept. 1. That would raise as much as $2.5 billion for the Edison parent 
company. 
In addition, Democrats increased the amount that SoCal would have to pay to 
$1.7 billion from $1.2 billion. 
The governor struck a similar deal with San Diego Gas & Electric for its 
power lines. 
That bill has not yet been voted on by the committee, said Ray Sullivan, chief 
of staff to Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. 
The energy crisis will put a strain on the state's budget reserves, said 
Doug Heller, a spokesman for Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell. 
Campbell and lawmakers of both parties agree that SoCal and Edison need to 
sell their transmission lines to give them a chance to become viable. 
But they disagree over how the proceeds of any sale should be divided among 
ratepayers, taxpayers and investors who backed the utilities. 
GOP lawmakers said the Edison deal, which has been called bailout, should not 
be used to pay off debt that is solely the responsibility of shareholders. 
Instead, Edison shareholders should be paid off, so the state's budget 
officials would not have to borrow to pay the debt, Campbell said. 
Edison and SoCal say they lack the cash and credit to survive the energy 
crisis. Without the transmission lines, both companies could be forced into 
bankruptcy within two weeks. 
A transmission line acquisition bill by Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, 
remains stalled because Senate Republicans will not allow a vote on it. 
Sher's plan, SB47X, has languished in the Senate for months because it 
lacked support from key lawmakers. 
Senate Democrats added $3.3 billion in borrowing to win Republican support 
for a companion bill, SB28X, which the Senate passed last week. It authorizes 
the Department of Water Resources to sell as much as $13.4 billion in bonds to 
buy power. 
The $13.4 billion in state bonds would be added to the more than $12 billion 
in bonds the agency has already signed. 
Edison and SoCal say they are close to bankruptcy because they have been 
overcharged by power generators, which have received premium prices for 
months.

Lockyer challengesGenerators' 'bluff' 
Another lawsuit may be on the way: The governor says power wholesalers are 
lining up behind the generators in the antitrust lawsuit. 
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 10, 2001) 
Faced with a growing chorus of critics and uncertainty about its 
long-term-contract strategy, the Davis administration issued a dire warning 
Friday to California's major power generators: Shape up or face another 
lawsuit. 
While attorneys for Gov. Gray Davis will continue negotiations for long-term 
contracts with the companies, the warning was apparently a warning shot: Line 
up behind the state and fight for the best deal you can get, or face an 
antitrust lawsuit similar to the one</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:31
