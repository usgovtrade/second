"youre a piece of shit and I hate you. I had dinner with my family with some 
very important people who weren't pleased that my time was taken up for 
dancing.  It really wasn't necessary."

It was my first lesson, so I was really excited to get so much attention from 
the teacher. He was a super cool guy and did an amazing job of teaching me 
all the basics.  Afterwards we just hung out, drank some beers, and ended up 
making out.  That was a long time ago, but I still remember all the techniques 
and steps of how to dance. It looked like you didn't get any of the above, 
which is a shame!  I hope you have fun partying on my dime!!

I can't wait!!!
Are you up for a night of dancing?

What are you drinking?  I have that in the fridge already.

What do you mean by 'I'm going to dance like a maniac?'

Also, do you have any idea where Jill might be?  I don't think she said.

ESA has not authorized you to use EOL addresses.  There could be a 
possibility of lawsuits and having to turn over passwords.  

Jillian,

I had not yet booked my flight when I sent the message below.  In case ESA 
didn't give you the ok, I was wondering if you would be up for a night of 
dancing?  You can just get off work around 6:30 and I'll pick you up at your 
house.  Just let me know!

Thanks!
Jillian


Wilson,

I had not booked my flight yet but was wondering if you wanted to get some 
dinner one night after work.  It will probably be after 6:30 because of traffic.

I had not yet planned on flying yet... let me think about it.  I might take 
you up on dinner, but I am still on the fence about flying.  I will let you 
know!

You must be the only person in Houston never to go out. 

I have a couple of questions, though. What are you going to have me do while 
you are away? Are you going to pick my brain while I am gone? And is this the 
whole weekend?

How far out are you guys?

You are not going to believe this...

I am moving in the "Merit" direction!!!!! I am leaving work on Friday to go 
house shopping.  I am driving from Houston to Austin on Saturday morning and 
then I will drive back to Houston on Saturday afternoon.  I will sleep on the 
way back and will be there Saturday night.  Does that mean you will actually 
see me?  Well it should mean seeing me.  So I will call you Saturday 
afternoon from Austin.
