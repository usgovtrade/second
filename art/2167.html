A friend recently let me in on a nice little secret: Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is actually a really good game. I never would have guessed, to be honest. The only two kinds of games I’ve been exposed to throughout my entire life are Pokemon and Final Fantasy, both of which are good in a totally non-technical and subjective way. The only things about RPGs I know is that they're “long” and “I like to keep my eyes closed.” Well now I know the reason why.

The game was a fairly low-budget production, and there aren't a ton of copies floating around the internet if you're searching for it (shame on you). The story is amazing, and the plot is actually coherent and interesting. While most RPGs make a lot of annoying and unnecessary changes to the plot halfway through (see: Final Fantasy X), this game makes me want to look up some plot summaries and find out what happens at the end! Of course, none of the characters are incredibly memorable, and the plot is filled with boring fetch-quests and repetitive side-quests, but if you have the patience for it, it’s worth checking out.

Anyway, that’s a small insight into my game experience. Now, something that inspired me to write this.

You probably remember me talking about Star Wars: Clone Wars a while back, right? Well, my dad happened to bring it up that I probably should get around to watching it. In the past, I’ve never been a fan of Star Wars, and I was honestly surprised by this movie. It’s not as good as some of the other Star Wars movies out there, but I’d say that it’s good enough for me. Plus the fact that Darth Vader is basically the main character in the movie makes it even better. I know I shouldn’t say this, but I never really cared much for him as a character. I’ve always thought that he was the type of evil person that you just get along with because they’re so easy to get along with. I mean, he’s evil. He has absolutely no shame or remorse.

I’ve decided that the only thing I hate more than evil people is people that try to justify themselves. For some people, it seems like it’s easier to do this than it is to work on themselves and try to be better people.

My problem with the new Star Wars movie is the fact that these kids are just so damn innocent. They always act so surprised whenever anything bad happens to them, as though they’re the first ones to ever get in trouble, but they just keep living in this bubble, thinking that everything’s perfectly fine until a giant monster comes out of nowhere and smashes their bubble. I wish I could explain it more clearly, but it just bothers me how the majority of the movie is focused on the innocent nature of these kids.

It’s even worse when you consider that, after watching the movie, you realize that this movie would be much better if it were only made of just one character that is evil. Not that I wish death upon anyone, but I would much rather watch evil people do bad things and die than to watch kids make the same stupid mistakes that they did at the beginning of the movie for two hours.

I also noticed that none of the main characters seemed very “powerful.” It seems that these people are all so weak and stupid. I guess this might be more obvious if you see Star Wars: Clone Wars first, but then there’s no one interesting to make the main character. You need at least one character who’s stronger than the other characters.

Meh, that happens in every single movie. My mom’s always told me it’s because a lot of the movies have a positive message behind them. I agree with you, however, that it’s too bad that the movie centers so much on the kids instead of the evil characters. Makes sense, I suppose.

I’m pretty sure that movie did put an emphasis on the kids, and honestly it has nothing to do with having a positive message behind them. It just sort of makes me wonder how these characters were supposed to become heroes in the first place if they can’t handle some weird aliens with huge lightsabers and a mysterious space empire.

The movie “The Dark Crystal” was supposed to be this awesome fantasy adventure that had a positive message about “growing up and accepting yourself.” It was a complete disaster.

I think the movie should’ve been made so that the audience was left to wonder who was the evil character. Instead of focusing on the good guys, the audience should’ve been left in a “Who is the evil character? And how are they doing this? And why? How can we fight them?” mindset. It would have done much more justice for the movie. Instead, it’s just a bunch of really generic movies with just a few more awesome characters thrown in to try and save it.

To some extent, I’m actually thinking about doing the same thing with my novel! I want my main character to be a “normal” kid, who does normal kid things, and I’m really trying to find his personality that seems as normal as possible. It’s tough because most people just don’t know about my book, so it would be difficult to make sure that it’s not too bland. I think though, once I find out more about the character, it’ll come naturally.

I always wondered why people would like movies like The Matrix that had a much darker theme, because as a whole, kids (especially in their teens) can see right through the evil-like nature of the main character(s). The only way for a movie like this to succeed is if the main character was just as vulnerable as anyone else. I also noticed that movies like Shrek never had this problem, even though the main character is an asshole.

On the other hand, I can’t think of a single movie (non-animated and non-cartoon) that had a really good depiction of an evil child. Not even Anakin Skywalker as a kid, at least not that I can recall. So, yeah.

I agree with you about the movie Shrek! That was one of my favorite movies of all time. At least the good guy in Shrek had a good amount of depth in his personality. I don’t know. That is one movie that you should definitely check out.

It’s funny you bring up Anakin Skywalker, because even though he isn’t that evil, a lot of people actually seem to have a lot of issues with him. He’s not completely innocent and all that, but when you first watch it, you might say that he’s innocent because he’s too busy making Star Wars a better place for everyone else. And on top of that, when you really think about it, most evil characters aren’t that evil. You could try and convince me that Vader is evil, but that just isn’t the case. The main characters are usually supposed to be the bad guys in movies like Star Wars, and in the end they usually end up redeeming themselves. They have the choice to either take over and continue the destruction or step back and let their friend-turned-insanely-powerful enemy do it for them. A good example is that Jedi knight who lived in the Star Wars movies who had a good friend with the name of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He eventually betrayed him to Darth Vader and later died, but the audience still knows that he didn’t want to betray the other Jedi. His actions are always good for what he needs to do.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:05
