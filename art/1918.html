This is an example of a basic html page, in a typical frame.

This is a text frame, that contains some text. A text frame can have
attributes (tags). There are a lot of text attributes in html

Some frame content will be used by other frames too, which we will
display above the frame content. This is a frame above frame. There
are framesets in html, that are used to provide alternative frames, for
content. In this page, the alternate text "I like the frame" in the last
row will be used by a frameset. You can insert some content in frames,
from outside the frameset (the text inside the frame)

You can make your own frameset for other frames, inside a frameset. You
can move from one frame to another frame using <A href="frame 2 URL">frame
2 content</A> You can display content within a frameset (a frameset is a
collection of frames), using <A href="frame 3 URL">text</A> , or
you can display a frame within a frameset (within a frameset). There
are some methods to do this in html, such as iframes, framesets, the
frameset tag and <A href="frame 3 URL">tag </A>

Frames can also be used in the page itself. frames within the frameset
can be nested to one or more frames. You can find other frame content
from other sources, which is an example of html frames

The frameset tag will allow you to navigate between frames. For example
<A href="frame 1 URL">frame 1 content</A>

The frameset in the page is used as an example of multiple frames, and
other methods for displaying frames (frames are usually a section of a
web page with more content, which is defined by the name of the frame,
which is often different from the name of the webpage). The following
content will be displayed in a frameset, with a frameset

The following content will be displayed in a frameset, with a frameset
<A href="frame 1 URL">frame 1 content</A> , and
another frameset <A href="frame 2 URL">frame 2 content</A>

This is another sample of text within the frame. The frame content, as
content of a frame, can be written in any format, such as html or txt.
