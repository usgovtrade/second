Moody’s Analytics have published their annual report of financial results of the global game industry in 2015.

Apparently, the sales for consoles have dropped considerably.

Nintendo 3DS

The market has had a significant decline this year, which will result in a loss of revenue from 20.1% of sales to 19.8%. The report is not yet complete and the final results could be anywhere between 17% and 22% of its predecessors.

Nintendo 3DS

In fact, it was the Japanese that have suffered the biggest declines, dropping more than 12%.

Nintendo 3DS

In the end, The Nintendo 3DS came on top. The PlayStation Vita has shown great weakness during the course of the year and is expected to be discontinued by Sony at the end of this year.

PS4 is not expected to sell as well in 2015, but will continue to grow. Xbox One will have another good year in 2015. Microsoft is still very interested in video games, the market and the results of Xbox One, so we can still count on them.

PS4

Console sales have dropped considerably in the past year, with the sales of the Xbox One suffering most. Although the report is not yet finished, it has been seen that the PlayStation 4 will have a better year than Xbox One. The Xbox One was the best selling console in 2014.

PS4

In general, the console game industry has suffered in 2015. But the market has also changed a lot. Mobile games, e-sports and digital distribution are being counted increasingly as the main sources of income.

PS4

Microsoft made a lot of mistakes in the past years and its failure was the first factor, but it was not the main reason for these results. They will have to learn from the difficulties and start a new, more successful strategy for the future.

Xbox One

Sony has a solid base to build on, but there are some problems that need to be solved quickly. Microsoft can not let Sony to establish an unassailable position. They will have to change their strategy and get a strong presence in the console market for the next few years.

Xbox One

Sony will have to put more effort into the future. It has to be more active in mobile gaming and in the gaming cloud. It can not rely only on this to succeed.

On average, it is no longer a good year. With a bit of luck, it will start to get better next year.

Sony PlayStation

Sony is still struggling with a poor performance of their PS4 console, with less and less success than their competitors. And Microsoft will also have to continue to grow.

The Xbox One was a commercial failure for Microsoft and they are also having a bit of trouble on the business side. Its future depends on the results of the next couple of years, but they have to learn quickly.

Microsoft Xbox One

As one of the world’s largest gaming companies, the future of Sony and Nintendo can not be completely relied on. They will have to try to develop games for all types of players. It will be a big challenge, but it can bring positive results.

Nintendo Switch

The Wii U was not even enough to change the trend. But if the new games in the game console have the popularity that was hoped, Nintendo will be able to improve sales in a second attempt. If they fail, Nintendo can be shut out of the market for good.

There are several competitors out there, so they have to be even stronger than they were in the past. The consoles can become an important thing for the owners, but not the center of attention.

Nintendo Switch

The Switch will continue to play a role, as long as it has some unique features and remains affordable for casual users. Unfortunately, this trend may end very soon.

PS4 may continue to struggle in 2015 with the rise of Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s strategy shift to a larger focus on games. Nintendo will continue to focus on casual gamers in Japan, and only slowly develop Western markets.

Sony PS4

The Xbox One has taken over the leadership, with the PlayStation 4 struggling to hang on to first place. There is not much hope for the Xbox One, but they are still able to improve in the next couple of years.

Sony is really struggling to remain a leader in the video game industry. The Xbox One has a much more aggressive price cut and will almost definitely pass the PS4 in total sales by 2016.

Xbox One

They could continue to decline due to Sony and Nintendo, but Microsoft is in a good position. They will still have a place in the market, even if the sales have not improved much in the past year.

The company still has strong reserves, so the decline is not all that bad. It is only a matter of time before we see something that catches them off guard. But it will certainly take more than a year to get back to the peak sales of 2013.

PS4

The decline of the Wii U is not yet clear and they need to wait for the first results. The Xbox One has managed to beat the expectations and become the dominant player in the gaming industry.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:00
