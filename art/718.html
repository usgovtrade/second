Now. Or I

I 
looked at 
the wall of 
enormous men. I knew they 
would never let me go 
back. I was caught in their 
power. A 
terrible sensation of fear 
squeezed me as the reality 
of my situation struck me 
once 
again. I thought of how I 
had looked at a group of men 
on 
the street, thinking that 
maybe they were going to 
beat 
me up. And now here I was 
face to face with some of the 
most physically fit people I 
had ever 
known. I thought of the 
incredible power these 
people 
held over me. They had the 
strength to do anything they 
wanted.

With 
eyes that seemed to 
pierce me, one of the men 
grabbed 
the baton from the 
officer. He had a look of 
hate as he pointed it at my 
face. I 
realized, this was it. If I 
cried out for help, I knew 
that I would be seriously 
harmed. The 
man who was standing on the 
other side of the table from 
me 
looked at me, and then back 
at the men. He spoke. "This 
is my best worker. Do you 
want to 
mess with me?" There were 
several noes. I was about to 
be in deep 
trouble. The officer with the
baton came up to me, and 
said, "This is one of the 
best 
guards in the school. Don't 
fuck around with her." I 
nodded in agreement. "She 
just 
goes nuts sometimes, you 
know? 
She's really a great 
guard." The 
officer left. I 
watched as the baton 
disappeared back into the 
middle of 
the table. "I hate to see 
this for 
you. You have so much more 
to give."

With 
a heavy heart I 
left school. In the end, I 
was 
punished by the same man I 
had given so much to. 
In the darkness of 
the night, I wondered if the
pain of 
his love was equal to the 
grief 
I felt now. Had I done 
something so bad that I could 
never 
escape his judgment and 
curses? But I knew I was not 
his 
responsibility. I thought of 
God, who 
lived in a place where he 
cannot 
be touched by hatred. I 
knelt 
down on the cold concrete. I 
turned 
my back to the wall, and 
began to pray, "God, do you 
see me, 
do you hear me. I am not 
afraid 
of you. You know I am not 
responsible for this. If I 
am, 
take it from me. If I have 
done something bad, I want to
be 
cured from it. Make me whole.
Make 
me strong. Make me know that 
I can 
love again, and that it's 
okay to 
live in the world." As I 
prayed, 
the dark fog of pain that 
overwhelmed me seemed to 
vanish. 
There was something so great 
about the feelings of 
reconciliation and joy that 
came over me. 
It was as if I was floating 
on a strong wind. I saw Jesus 
on 
the other side of the gates 
of 
hell, pulling me towards 
him. 
This would never have been 
possible if God 
had not given us his heart, 
which is filled with 
compassion. As I walked out 
of 
the darkness into the light 
of day, I 
saw God in everything and 
everyone 
I loved. And in that moment, 
I knew that 
God had the answer for me 
that no 
one else ever could. 
God gave me the most amazing 
gift that day. He gave me his 
love, and the trust that it 
will always be there for me. 
For God is light, and in him 
there is no darkness at all.
I love this book! I learned 
a lot about this and a lot 
more in my 
reading. You don't have to 
use a 
computer to read it, though, 
just one 
book that you can read. This 
is the 
story of life for the first 
century. 
How are you and what does 
this story mean for you? Have 
you 
ever thought about these 
things? Let's get into this 
world together. I can give 
you a 
link, also if you want. There 
are a 
couple of places where you 
can join, and one other thing,
if you want to talk. I would 
love 
to have this video with you 
to talk about this book. Let 
me 
know what you would like me 
to talk about. How would you 
like me to 
end this? I can use your link 
and your name for anyone who
wants to get the message. 
Thanks so much for having me 
here! Thanks for listening to 
the 
sermon, the book, and the 
videos and music. I love you, 
my friends. Good night.
God bless.

Amen.

Pastor's 
Brief 
Bio: 
My name is 
Rosa Rodriguez. I was born 
and raised in Boston, MA. I 
graduated from Boston 
University and Northeastern 
University in Boston. I have a
Master's degree from 
Lincoln Christian 
University in Lincoln, Rhode 
Island. 
I have been an ordained pastor 
since July of 2014.
I love God and I am passionate
about Jesus, and being in 
community with people, 
especially with God's 
children, I encourage them to
find their purpose.
My family is my strength,
spiritual adviser, church 
family, 
hired helpers, 
and everything in-between. I 
am married to my husband Dave 
and I have three wonderful 
children.

Our Vision:
We are all children 
of God and our vision is to 
exemplify the unconditional 
love that we experience in 
God's 
house through the unconditional
love we have for God. Our 
purpose 
is to provide a place where 
everyone can be who God 
created 
them to be.

We Believe:
That the Bible is the Word of 
God and that we believe every 
word 
in the Bible is inspired by 
God and that it should be
understood as God's word.

We Respect All Persons:
We respect all persons and 
strive to create a safe 
environment.

We Encourage:
We love that we can 
encourage each other, so that
everyone feels valued and 
that everyone has an equal 
voice in the decisions made 
here.

We Believe:
That a life lived to the 
fullest glorifies God. We 
believe that our worth is in 
Christ and we are to be 
honoring 
and glorifying God for who we
are.

Our prayer:
We love that we are not 
afraid to ask for forgiveness 
or to receive forgiveness for
all our mistakes. God is 
loving, He is forgiving, and 
He is willing to accept us 
just as we are.

This Church is Not a Cult:
We believe that the Trinity 
(Father, Son, Holy Spirit) and
Father alone are our God and 
Father. We love that Jesus is 
God and His Holy Spirit 
and 
that we as Christians respect 
others views on Jesus and 
different religions. We are 
not afraid to talk about what 
it's like for people of 
other 
faiths because we love people 
and we want to love the 
people.
