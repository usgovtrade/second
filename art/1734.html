If you're after some nice fantasy that'll actually hold your interest, there's a lot to like here. Definitely check it out.

"This book is about magic. It is also about love and friendship and loss. It is about growing up, and growing older. It is about people who don't see the beauty in the world all the time, and about people who do. "

"It's an important book for me, because I never wrote it when I was young enough to write it before. And as I have done since the start of the YA Revolution, I hope that it will help to push it forward."

"It's that feeling when your eyes are fixed on a beautiful flower and you wish you could bottle that beauty, keep it forever, so you could keep relishing the beauty of life in the here and now. That is my definition of a book."

"I love books that are magical, epic, and romantic all in one. But I think I love to love characters in books more than anything."

"I want to talk about the reason why. I want to talk about that point in the world where you realize you were written into a book and now you're trying to live the story that someone else wrote for you. "

"I want every reader to have their own unique experience with books. I want them to fall in love with reading the way I did when I was little."

Hello and welcome to Books, Books, Books! I'm Alex, a 21 year old History student from Manchester, UK. Ever since I was young I have been a lover of the written word and a bookworm. I have constantly devoured books in the many genres I have existed within, although I have found that fantasy and mythology are my true passions. I like to think of myself as more of a 'book-aholic' than just a bookworm, and I am always on the hunt for new and exiting books! As you may have noticed I have recently become a self published author, and it's quite a crazy experience to come to the realization that you can put your thoughts out into the public sphere. I hope you enjoy my blog, and all your comments are welcome!

New Releases

Each month, I will post about a book that has a fresh release of that month, plus there will be a very brief book review about the book, all I do is post the review on Goodreads, and that's it. If there's anything else you'd like to see me post about, just let me know in the comments.

Fiction books will be marked with (F), and non-fiction books will be marked with (NF). Click on the covers to buy the books.

I hope you enjoy reading my blog. If you do, please remember that reviews and opinion are always welcome! Oh, and did I mention? You can FOLLOW ME HERE:
