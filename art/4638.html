It's a good thing ABC decided to make Mr. Jefferson High their next comedy. That way people still know who he is.

Pierce will play the principal on the new ABC sitcom, according to our sister site Deadline.com.

The six-episode, multi-cam comedy, "Mr. Jordan's Neighborhood," will be helmed by former "Will and Grace" executive producer Tracey Wigfield. ABC declined to comment.

Pierce made his bones on the big screen with roles in "Boyz N the Hood" and "Do the Right Thing" before settling into the role of Detective William 'Bunk' Moreland on HBO's "The Wire." He has appeared in films like "The Great Debaters," "Dreamgirls" and "The Last Castle."

He also appears in the HBO comedy, "Bored to Death," which recently was picked up for a second season.

Pierce is the latest of a slew of big-screen stars to reteam with television this fall.

As a reminder, they include Eddie Murphy who is producing NBC's "The Paul Reiser Show" and starring in "Anger Management," which airs on FX.

And of course, the biggest news is that "Lost" alum Ben & Kate, John Krasinski and Jenna Elfman, are getting their own ABC sitcom. That's right: "I Love Dick," which will debut in March.

"We saw the characters and instantly fell in love with them and the relationship dynamics," the stars of "I Love Dick" said in a joint statement. "Their comedic sensibility is in tune with our own off-beat and original sensibility."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:57
