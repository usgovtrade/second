Your skin’s natural bacterial balance can become compromised and cause a variety of skin conditions. As we age, some of these conditions may become persistent.

At the BodyCare Center, we have a treatment called Phyto-Aerobic Injection Therapy. This treatment uses a bacteria taken from a healthy person’s mouth and applied by microinjection. As the bacteria are delivered to the skin, your skin’s natural bacterial balance is restored to health.

This treatment is proven to significantly help improve the skin’s natural immunity and can provide relief from chronic skin conditions, such as acne, eczema and dry skin.

Hair and Scalp Care

Are your hair and scalp in poor condition?

Hair and scalp health plays an important role in contributing to a person’s overall well-being. From the appearance to the smell of your hair, scalp health and scalp massage are important factors that contribute to hair quality and health.

Hair loss, dryness and itching, the appearance of dandruff, and skin irritation, can all be symptoms of poor scalp health and conditioning. The good news is that proper conditioning will help with the treatment of most of these symptoms. At the BodyCare Center, our Scalp massage technique increases the blood flow to the scalp and nourishes the scalp. This is achieved by massaging the scalp with oils that have a direct positive effect on hair health. This massage has long been known to stimulate blood flow in your scalp and reduce stress. Additionally, during the massage, your hair will be combed, giving it time to have exposure to oxygen and light. Oxygen has a positive effect on hair growth and also reduces your hair’s susceptibility to breakage. We also offer a full shampoo and treatment using an aromatherapy-based shampoo for a healthier look.

A full body massage in combination with oil, a facial and scalp massage, your hair will feel and look healthier. It is important to keep in mind that the hair grows in stages. As you have different hairstyles and your condition changes, so should your scalp care. As you grow older, the care you need will change, the frequency may even be increased. As such, it is important that you maintain your hair by having a regular routine of shampooing, conditioning and maintenance.

Facials

The skin on your face is an indicator of your overall health. When you have a balanced lifestyle, a balanced diet and sufficient exercise, it will have a healthy appearance. A face is an area that sees the most exposure to sun, dirt and pollution, and it is thus important to invest time to care for your skin in order to achieve and maintain its natural appearance.

This special treatment will leave you with a new, healthier appearance.

Wrinkles

At the BodyCare Center we know that no one wants wrinkles. We know that they make our clients uncomfortable and that some of them are unwilling to discuss them. But no one is happy with wrinkles, and they are a fact of aging. Wrinkles and other aspects of skin aging are caused by genetic predisposition and environmental conditions. Therefore, we emphasize in the use of skin care to prevent aging and wrinkles.

The aging process is related to the loss of collagen and elastin, which contribute to skin tightening and tone. We use a process that involves the injection of anti-wrinkle peptides. This is a substance that allows a chemical reaction between its amino acids that help firm and tighten the skin and strengthen the skin’s elasticity.

Skin Care Products

We believe that the use of pure natural products such as coconut oil, almond oil and shea butter can create a healthy balance in the skin, allowing you to achieve your skin care goals.

Coconut Oil

Coconut oil is derived from coconut shells and the inner meat, which is then extracted. It has an amazing antibacterial and moisturizing effect. A large part of Coconut oil is saturated fat, however, the remaining parts are unsaturated fat, which are known for their ability to be absorbed quickly and easily by the body. With the application of this oil, you are able to attain quick results and achieve a healthier glow.

The benefits of Coconut oil are not only limited to its antibacterial properties. The natural fats contained in Coconut oil may be easily absorbed into the skin. This Coconut oil is known to have an extraordinary moisturizing effect and its antioxidant properties reduce the appearance of aging, while encouraging cell renewal and regeneration.

At BodyCare Center, we use a pure, mild and refined version of this oil, which means that you can benefit from its amazing healing properties. Coconut oil has been known to effectively eliminate a dry and cracked skin and is suitable for both pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers. Coconut oil is made in the U.S.A. and uses no artificial preservatives or chemicals. This is a product of the highest quality and purity and is naturally rich in vitamins, minerals, Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and is great for skin renewal, moisture balance and the protection of natural sun and free radicals.

Almond Oil

The almond tree is a very valuable tree that grows wild in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is the seed of the fruit that is known to have excellent nutritional value. It is rich in Omega-6 fatty acids, proteins, carbohydrates and vitamins, as well as minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc.

The almond has an important role in health and anti-aging products. Almonds are rich in vitamin E, antioxidants and are very hydrating. These nutrients protect your skin from the signs of aging and make the skin feel soft and moist. The presence of vitamin E in almonds makes them effective in the repair of the skin. Vitamin E makes up for any damage caused by environmental factors and prevents a loss of elasticity and the reduction of collagen that causes dry, wrinkled skin.

Almonds are an excellent solution for the maintenance of healthy skin that reduces the signs of aging and slows down the process of wrinkles.

Almond oil is known as a moisturizer with skin care benefits. It is rich in Vitamin E that protects skin from environmental factors and the symptoms of aging, while also encouraging the natural production of collagen, which is vital in maintaining your skin’s tone and appearance.

It is natural and pure, as it is cold-pressed and unrefined, and therefore it has a gentle and beneficial effect on the skin.

Cucumber Lotion

The high levels of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are contained in the Cucumber have been proven to increase skin moisture and elasticity.

As an age-defying ingredient, the high levels of Vitamin C that are found in Cucumber have been proven to protect the skin from wrinkles and improve the appearance of your skin. The high Vitamin C content in Cucumber makes it a great source of antioxidants that help in the prevention of oxidative damage. This is especially beneficial for the aging process.
