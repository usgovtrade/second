There is a need for such structures which are also sufficiently strong and rigid so as to be functional in use. There is a further need for such structures that have the ability to bend or flex but yet are able to return to their original shape once the distortion forces are released. Such structures are useful for a number of purposes, most notably as shock absorbers and energy absorbing bumpers. One area of potential application is within a vehicle's suspension system. A shock absorber or energy absorber could be used between a vehicle's axles or between one of the vehicle's axles and its body, to prevent excessive vibration in the vehicle. Another area of potential application is in an instrument panel mounted on a vehicle chassis or structural member. An energy absorbing bumper could be used to absorb impact energy in the event of a crash.
Shock absorbers or energy absorbers may also be useful for absorbing impact energy at various joints or links of a vehicular suspension system.
It is thus an object of the invention to provide a low cost, light weight shock absorber or energy absorber.
It is a further object of the invention to provide a shock absorber or energy absorber which can be readily adapted for use at various points in a vehicular suspension system.
It is a further object of the invention to provide such an energy absorber which has energy absorbing characteristics superior to existing energy absorbers made of steel or aluminum.
It is a further object of the invention to provide a system which is capable of being easily installed during manufacture of the vehicle body or chassis.
It is a further object of the invention to provide a system which is compatible with existing vehicular structural members.
It is a further object of the invention to provide a bumper system which is sufficiently flexible to allow for limited deformation in the event of impact, yet still return to its original shape once the impact force is removed.
It is a further object of the invention to provide a flexible structural member which is capable of supporting a compressive load in an operating environment, such as in a vehicle suspension system.
Further objects of the invention include the use of such flexible structures in automotive, recreational vehicles and industrial applications, both as vehicle components, as well as in buildings and furniture.
It is thus an object of the invention to provide flexible structures which can be used in many applications where high strength and rigidity are not necessarily required. For example, they could be used in the form of load carrying beams to support other structures. Other applications include the use as acoustic panels or dampers.
The present invention solves the above described problems by providing a method for making a resilient structure from an assembly of elongated metal or polymeric rods. In the case of polymeric rods, a thermoplastic material is selected which, after processing by the process, will remain in a rubbery state. In the preferred form of the invention, the polymeric rods comprise polyurethane tubing.
The present invention provides a method for manufacturing resilient energy absorber. The method includes providing a plurality of metal or polymeric rods each having a fixed outer diameter. Each rod is bent into a predetermined shape and held in that shape by a retaining ring. The retaining ring is inserted into a tubular retainer member which itself is also held in a predetermined shape by the elastic properties of a spring and an outer frame. The rod assembly is then placed within a heated pressure vessel which expands the assembly in at least one dimension by forcing the tubular retainer member into the outer frame and expanding the spring and the outer frame, thereby increasing the volume of the pressure vessel. A pressure differential is then introduced into the vessel to allow the retainer member to retract back into the outer frame and compress the spring. Finally, the pressure vessel is cooled causing the rod assembly to retain the new shape determined by the spring and tubular retainer member.
A plurality of resilient structures are produced from the processes described above. The structures may be positioned at a point in a vehicular suspension system or other vehicular support or body structure.
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a resilient structure.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a resilient structure which is comprised of a plurality of elongated rods or tubes held together by an outer framework.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a resilient structure which has a plurality of elongated rods or tubes wherein the rods or tubes are fixed at each end by a retaining ring and wherein the retaining ring is held in a tube with an expandable outer frame.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a resilient structure which is manufactured using a variety of shapes and sizes of metal or polymeric tubes.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a resilient structure which is held in place by an expandable outer frame.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a resilient structure which is manufactured using a combination of heated and cooled pressure vessels.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a resilient structure which is held in place by an expandable outer frame and wherein the inner structure is forced into the outer frame by internal pressure.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a resilient structure which can be constructed so as to provide a selected amount of flexural properties.
Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description and drawings wherein:</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:20
