a more simple one, that is to say that in a world we are starting to live in  
simply by speaking. In another world which is in some ways the same world  
but different, which is no longer a world ruled by a few but is already a world  
ruled by a majority of the inhabitants, who speak.

To begin with, this majority lives in towns, and their voices are heard.

But as for those who say that they have never lived in a town, I believe that  
in a different reality they would live in a city too.

The people of this reality are already united around them.

They live in the same city and know each other.

They live together without necessarily getting along.

They share the life they have.

This is my idea of a city, a city of the future.

A true community.

It will not exist, for there will not be one place where we can speak and be heard.

A city of speech.

A city of voices.

Where there will be no order but where there will be communication.

Communication in the broadest sense of the word.

Communication and listening to others, who may or may not be telling the truth.

Communication, listening, conversation.

A true city of conversation.

I have always liked to think that the city is the space of the mind.

When it comes to communication, I would like to believe that it has the same  
relation to language as the city does to the town.

I am starting to understand that we are not far from this.

A city where it is impossible to hear someone else being quiet,

but where the silence is the speech,

where there is no silence without a voice.

A city of speaking,

of sharing knowledge and information,

of understanding.

And of listening.

A true city of listening.

It will not be a city of noise or of disorder,

but a city of conversation and questions.

It will not be a city of silence but a city of spoken things.

It will not be a city without borders,

but a city that transcends borders.

A city that knows everything and that knows itself.

It will be a city that can live, that can listen, that can talk.

A city of the future.

A true city.

A true reality.

A city of the present.

A true life.

A true space.

The place where we are starting to live.

This is the reality of the future that I want,

that I ask of this reality.

A city of people.

What kind of city?

A city of minds.

A city of ideas.

A city of ideas and sounds.

A city where we know each other and where we are all of us one another.

Where we communicate.

And where we listen.

A true city of listening and speaking.

This is the city I dream of.

A city that lives.

A city of conversation.

A city of dreams.

A true city.

I believe that this city will be built by words.

I believe that we will have to speak,

that it will be the work of the mind,

and that in this city words will be our eyes.

That this city will no longer be a city that lives,

but a city that dreams.

That this city will no longer be the city of bodies,

but a city of voices.

That this city will no longer be a city where we can be together,

but a city where we have to be together.

This city will not be a city of cities.

It will be a city where we will have to learn to speak.

A city of the mind.

A city of truth.

A city where we are starting to live.

This is my dream.

This is the idea of the future I wish for.

Not a city of silence, but a city of words.

A city of voices.

A city of the future.

An idea of the future.

A city of dreams.

What city?

This city.

This is the city that I wish.

# 3. THE TURN TOWARD SILENCE

I believe that a lot of things will start to happen that are beyond our control.

I believe that we will lose our grip on the future, that a new reality is  
growing within us.

I believe that we will start to realize that we have been mistaken

and that we have let down our humanity,

that we have fallen into the trap of silence.

I believe that in this silence we have learned to speak without words.

I believe that there is no longer any need to speak,

and I believe that we will finally wake up,

we will discover that this silence that we have lived for too long is a silence  
in which we have lived like an animal.

I believe that this silence is what we need most.

I believe that we have discovered the silence, and it is the silence of the  
past.

I believe that we have lost our grasp of the future,

that we have lost ourselves,

that we have forgotten that we live in a time when we are starting to live in  
words.

A time when we can have conversations.

We live in a time that is becoming silent,

that is becoming a time of speech.

A time of silence.

This is what I think.

This is what I know.
