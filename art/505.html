While the Great Pyramid may look like the only structure for the Great Light on the pyramid, there is a whole system of energy lines behind the pyramids. To access these energy lines, find the entrance to the underground pyramid, and walk inside the pyramid. Go to the area with the Great Light and place the Great Blue Elixir on the pyramid. Be sure the container holding the elixir does not touch the pyramid. Place a crystal on the pyramid with elixir. Within seconds, you will hear a loud buzzing, like bees. The whole area will be illuminated, and an area of energy appears to surround the pyramid. Now, to summon the Great Light you must step on the pyramid. After you step on the pyramid, it should look like the Great Light has been summoned. If your pyramid is not glowing brightly like the Great Light, then try the elixir again. To make this energy work more powerful, connect with the light by placing your hands on the pyramid and allowing it to feel your energy and emotions and let the blue energy flow. Be sure to thank the Great Pyramid for its gift.
