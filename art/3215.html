But love makes a way when there's nothing left to do

So don't ever let love burn out like a flame that dies

I don't know why I never listen to my heart 'cause it speaks the same thing

We have nothing else to say but it's what we hear

Like the beating of two broken hearts

I hear love in your words and hear you talk about

Some things we ain't gonna make it through

It's like my hands are frozen when you're with me

And I get a kick when you're not around

And when I'm around

And when I'm around it's me and my pain

I'm just thinking about you and it's time that we are all over the blame

What will happen when we get old, like two leaves on the vine

Can I be your friend, the only thing left to be

Can I be your friend, just one last thing to be

Can I be your friend, the only thing left to be

Can I be your friend, just one last thing to be

You know I don't care what I look like

'Cause I know you love me when we're away from the crowd

When I'm gone, you don't even seem sad

No no no no no

When you're gone

When you're gone

When you're gone, you don't even seem sad

No no no no no

When you're gone, you don't even seem sad

Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah

When you're gone, you don't even seem sad

Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

When you're gone, you don't even seem sad

No no no no no no no no no no no no

No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

Ooh

I remember, when love was just a game

When we would spend hours just talking and listening

'Till the next day and I'd miss your face

That's when I knew we couldn't let the sun go down on us

Before we give up and tell each other

It's time to say our goodbyes

Sometimes you're sad and sometimes you're glad

It's you, it's me

But it's never like it used to be

But it's never like it used to be

But it's never like it used to be

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

It's never like it used to be

Now that you're with me

I never listen to what you say

'Cause you can tell me all you want

That I don't belong around you

And there's so many reasons I should walk away from you

But all I want to do is be around you

We don't know what our future holds

And we're not in control of what we feel

But I'm stuck here with you just pretending everything's OK

And there's no escaping from our love

But love is like the tide, it never comes back and it keeps coming back

We get so excited when we're all alone in the night

When I'm gone, you don't even seem sad

And there's so many things I could have said to make you stay

And there's so many words that I wanted to say to you

If only I could have known what was gonna happen next

'Cause if it's not this then it's never us

'Cause if it's not this then it's never us

If it's not this then it's never us

I don't know where you are

Don't know if you're somewhere

I don't know if you're coming back

I just know I don't like where I am without you

The day that I knew it was over

I knew when I looked in your eyes and you told me that you loved me for the first time

What I didn't know was how to let you go

And though the sun is shining and though the sky is blue

I can't shake this feeling that we're both the same

But if the sun is shining and if the sky is blue, there must be someone who could explain it all to me, right?

And though the stars never show

I can still feel the glow of your love

You know, you know

How it hurts when you walk away

When you walked away

'Cause it hurts to know that there will never be

The way it used to be with you

'Cause it hurts to know that you've fallen from grace

And you can't get up anymore

But even though you know that you shouldn't feel what you feel

When I hear you talk about it, you get me where I can't breathe

And even though I know I should walk away, I can't do it, no

And I can't do it, no

I wish that we could talk this through to get me through the night

But all that I can do is remember that I love you with my heart

And even though you can't hear me now, I'll always love you 'cause it hurts to know that you feel what you feel

And you can't get up anymore

And it's hard to know that you're always gone

But even though you know that you shouldn't feel what you feel

I'll always love you 'cause it hurts to know that you feel what you feel

And I'll always love you 'cause it hurts to know that you feel what you feel
