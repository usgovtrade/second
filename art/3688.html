"Well, the person's a very-high-profile, well-known producer named Joe Harkin." "I've been his assistant for years." "He makes one crazy game every year." "Well, I'm sure you can get him to pull this footage." "Why the hell is someone threatening me?" "We don't know what you did, but we know that someone is gunning for you." "So I have some calls to make." "I'm going to leave now." "You think you can do this job?" "That's good to know." "All right." "Here's the thing-- for a guy like you, a guy who's never served in the military, in this case, it's just kind of tough to prove that you actually have what it takes." "I got the medal." "That's not gonna be good enough." "You have to go out and show us that you're a warrior." "I'll tell you what-- you can stay here for the next three weeks." "See if you can just prove to me that you deserve to keep that medal and go home with it." "You know, there's a place down the street, right across the street from this shooting range." "Aaron here is gonna drop you off, and he's gonna meet us later today." "Wait, wait." "And all I do is go there?" "You go there." "And then you kill people on a video game." "No." "Wait." "It's not that easy, guys." "This guy is going to make sure you get into the video game." "Then we're gonna get the guy that wants you dead." "And that'll prove to me that you're a warrior." "Now, I know this isn't really your fight." "If it was your fight, we'd be out there and this would be over right now." "The way I see it, you're either with us or against us." "What do you say?" "I'll do it." "Deal." "Right there." "You." "I know what you're thinking, buddy-- the guy doesn't look like much." "Maybe that's why they made him a warrior." "But like my old man always used to say" ""You are what you look like."" "You'll do." "Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!" "What are you doing?" "Let's go, sir." "What are you doing?" "Take it easy!" "We just got here!" "You want to get shot, is that it?" "What?" "No." "Don't move!" "The hell's going on?" "I'm not sure." "Maybe he doesn't like the shirt." "You got to be kidding me." "All right, what's up?" "We have a situation." "Get inside, go through the back door." "Wait for me." "I'm going with him." "No." "Go inside." "You're not in uniform." "You can't go in there." "I'll wait here." "Why don't we start over?" "I'm Ray, from the police department." "He's Joe." "How you doing?" "You were here last year, right?" "Yeah, that's right." "Okay." "It's you guys again, huh?" "What's your problem?" "You." "In a few seconds, I'm going to be asking you a question." "Who are you and what do you want?" "Who I am and what I want is none of your business." "So the only thing you two are going to be asking each other is where in the hell did you put the money we gave you." "If you don't tell me where you put the money," "I'm going to shoot you." "You should do that." "We gave you $30,000 in cash." "Where's the money?" "What the hell are you doing?" "You shot me!" "Damn it!" "Where'd you learn to do that?" "Huh?" "How 'bout you tell me where the money is?" "Now!" "I don't have it!" "I don't have it." "Tell me where it is or I will kill you." "I don't have it." "I don't have it!" "I don't have it." "I don't have it." "Let him go." "Do you know who I am?" "Get in there!" "Go!" "Take it easy." "You okay?" "Good to see you again." "Likewise." "I guess I should thank you for saving my life today." "Anytime, partner." "We need to talk." "This is an old video game store." "I used to come here when I was little." "We just need to look around for a second." "Yeah." "That's all." "It's a lot different when you actually have to shoot something, isn't it?" "You're a good shot." "Yeah." "You hit me, actually." "I wasn't ready." "Yeah, I did notice that." "What?" "How fast you move, how accurate you are." "You fight like somebody trained in hand-to-hand combat." "Someone has trained me, but not for fighting." "For marksmanship?" "My dad." "Your dad was a..." "A soldier." "Yeah, you could say that." "Yeah." "And what about your mom?" "She die when you were young?" "My dad went away on a mission, and when he came back, she was gone." "But he kept you alive?" "He was a great dad and a good soldier." "You two got that same look in your eyes." "You said it wasn't my fight." "That's not what I meant." "But it's what you said." "Just like my dad said to me" ""You got to be what you look like."" "I think we're gonna make a pretty good team." "My team did some routine maintenance on the house, like replacing the security light on your front porch." "Thanks, guys." "I'm gonna go inside and take a shower." "Okay." "Your, uh, friends-- they didn't give you any problems?" "No, they just got the stuff and left." "But you know, Joe, you might want to consider relocating." "I mean, you just got back into town." "What do you mean?" "My friends were here." "I know." "They just told me they bought the place." "No." "Nobody actually told me that." "Okay." "Sorry." "Okay, look, I'll bring you the file on Joe Coughlin tomorrow, and you can start taking a look at it." "Are you asking me or telling me?" "Both." "Okay." "What is that?" "Someone stepped in front of a moving car in downtown L.A." "Whoever it is, he's dead." "Is he the guy with the medal?" "I don't know." "Did you find him or what?" "Yeah, I found him." "He's inside." "I'll be back." "Yeah?" "That's the place." "Looks like there's nobody home." "Hey!" "Hey, you guys open?" "No." "It's still locked." "That's strange." "Okay, I'm gonna go around back." "You keep an eye on things here." "You got it." "Hey, are you okay?" "Yeah." "Oh, my God." "You okay?" "No." "I'm all right." "I'm all right." "I'm going to call an ambulance." "Are you all right?" "No." "Help!" "Help!" "Help!" "Help me!" "Help me!" "Are you hurt?" "Are you hurt?" "Oh, God!" "Let go." "Help me!" "Help!" "Help!" "Get up!" "You want to do something about it?" "What?" "I said I'd like to do something about it." "No, I don't." "It's not that I don't like you." "You just don't do anything for me." "Okay." "That's a good start." "Where you going?" "In here!" "You come to finish the job?" "Who are you?" "You didn't think you'd get away with it, did you?" "What?" "You know what." "Yeah, I killed the guy." "No, you didn't." "Yes, I did." "He was gonna kill me." "You're not going anywhere." "Just hold it." "Just wait." "I got nothing more to say to you." "All right?" "You killed him?" "Yeah." "And now you're gonna kill me?" "No." "Are you gonna arrest me?" "Look, I was hired to kill you." "But after what happened back there," "I don't think they're ever gonna let me live this one down." "So, where does that leave me?" "Alive." "Not for long, though." "Hey, listen." "No more lies, all right?" "I want the truth." "What is the truth?" "You tell me what you were doing here." "What's going on?" "I was hired to kill you by a guy named Joe Coughlin." "Said you were in witness protection." "I</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:47
