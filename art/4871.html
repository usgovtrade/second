WATERTOWN, NY – What would you do if you saw a moving checkpoint just ahead of you on the highway? Would you go around or would you have the gall to try to drive through the checkpoint? That’s what someone did recently on I-87. An I-87 exit in Watertown was turned into a DUI checkpoint when the Connecticut State Police and State Highway Patrol were investigating a drunk driver.

The incident took place in the southbound lanes of I-87 just north of the intersection of Route 50. An eyewitness, who wishes to remain anonymous, stopped to watch the police operation and got out of his car to watch and snap some photos of the officers with their lights and sirens on.

He noticed that there was a very large moving truck with a sign on it for a moving company. As he was watching, he noticed a car pull up behind the moving truck. The car was stopped by police officers and its occupants were being interviewed. The moving truck’s driver was given a citation and informed that he had just missed hitting a DUI checkpoint.

The moving truck driver was issued a ticket for reckless driving for driving through the DUI checkpoint. The driver received his ticket and continued on to the checkpoint at the next exit.

There have been a number of “moving checkpoint incidents” reported recently by officers. In an attempt to protect motorists on the road, the Connecticut State Police and State Highway Patrol have been conducting these checkpoints to detect and deter drunk drivers.

A “moving checkpoint” is one that is moving. A stationary checkpoint is one that stays in one place. An officer will approach a moving vehicle and see if they can determine if the driver has had anything to drink and if they are currently impaired by alcohol.

State Police Lt. Paul Vance noted that moving checkpoints are more of an inconvenience than a safety hazard. Vance said that there have been close calls involving checkpoints, but there have not been any real moving checkpoint incidents in the last two years.

Vance said there is only one moving checkpoint that his agency issues tickets for. It is the case of a drunk driver who drove up to a moving checkpoint on Route 7. The driver was later found to be impaired by alcohol and arrested.

Motorists are encouraged to not drink any alcohol before driving or operating a motor vehicle. However, if someone was involved in an accident, they could be charged with a DUI. Additionally, anyone involved in an accident, especially a DUI accident, is encouraged to contact the police immediately.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Connecticut State Police by calling 1-800-TIP-3900. If you would like to report a drunk driver who was involved in an accident, please call the Connecticut State Police at 1-800-TIP-3900. You may remain anonymous. If you wish to speak with a police officer, please dial 911.

If someone you know was arrested for a moving vehicle offense, including impaired driving, please call our office and talk to a Connecticut criminal defense lawyer. You can reach the Connecticut Criminal Defense Attorneys at 1-888-567-5217. You can also reach the attorneys 24/7 at (203) 955-3939.
