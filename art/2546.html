(Don’t) Look Now, my favorite John Bailey production, makes it very clear that if you were born in Europe or Africa between the years of 1917 and 1929, you are likely a ghost, as in haunting the dreams of your living loved ones. The show is staged on a bare floor. It is a play that deals with sex, madness, ghosts, and the passage of time — all four of those issues can be seen playing out through the use of two-foot-high stage props and a bare floor. — Art of Gina, Theatre Is Easy

(Don’t) Look Now: How to Recognize The Signs of Hauntings and Talk Back to Your House Spirit (Paperback) by Linda Mackey is available on Amazon.com and in bookstores.
