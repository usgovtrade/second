We Are Gonna Live On Exile Island?! is a game show where at some point a contestant will be offered to a deal to go on "Exile Island" to take their chances to stay alive and play for the title. It works kind of like the show The Chase except there's no catch.

Hosted by Rob Walker who is known from other television shows like "Jeopardy!", "30 Rock", "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" and more, this game will have contestants getting clues and puzzles to win while stuck on Exile Island which will include puzzles, games and even a little bit of "The Price Is Right". When the contestant wins, they go back to the Main Stage. There are two types of game shows. Those like the one described here, and the ones with a catch which is when you run to some sort of escape room trying to get out before the clock runs out to win.

It's hard to imagine now, but in the past, game shows were about the game play and the contestants were considered a bonus. However, we have gotten used to watching game shows and now the entire show is about the game play and the contestants, including the host.

As we progress through the age of technology and streaming and such, game shows have lost their appeal and in time, even this show may be forgotten. It's interesting that such a time has come since we can't imagine what things were like when you had to be physically in a space for a few days for something that you could stay at home or wherever and play the game and then go home with no hassle. This could even become a reality TV show, making it less fun. Perhaps this shows that we are less desiring of the thrill of game shows and more interested in the game play. You could argue that it isn't really a game anymore, you just play to stay in there.

The best part of the show was that it made so much sense. The host doesn't interact with the contestants at all and really just provides clues and information and the most interesting part of it is that you don't know what will happen. You know you are going to get to go on Exile Island and there's no way to prepare and you don't know who will be there or how the clues work or if it'll be a game show or just a game. It's fascinating how it's based off of such an unusual premise, being that it's a game show that's also an escape room and also a part of an island which could have its own challenges.

This was a great game show and as a host, Walker did a very good job at making it fun to watch while also doing something different in the genre. There's always been this kind of competition game show where a contestant is eliminated and this had a chance to be another kind of game show. It was also well-made with good production values.

We are gonna live on Exile Island!!! is a great show and while it may not be a game show in the traditional sense of the word, it is still a game show. Now it's over and you can't get it back. All is not lost! You can still find episodes of it here at GameShowsNOW.com and other places online.
