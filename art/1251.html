This is one of the biggest releases of the year, and it may be the biggest one yet, if it performs like Bazooka Joe, if it performs like this at all. If you need further convincing, take a look at some of the pictures. They’re insane.

Well, you want more, huh? Here you go!

I got this one just before heading out to watch a showing of Muppets Most Wanted. But after watching them a second time, I realized they could make movies just like this!

They’re doing great work. And of course, there were a lot of interesting aspects to the marketing. The main one being that one of the lead characters isn’t even human! But of course, you see that it was a robot that was turned into a human, right? They didn’t even see it that way, but it’s been used now. It’s great marketing, really.

Well, now that they’re done working on the new comic, they’re starting in on the story development. One of the biggest questions I had about this whole project is how they’re planning on keeping these movies going. There’s only so many stories you can tell before people stop caring. But now that we have the answer: there’s more to this than just comic books.

I know my fellow Geeks out there are wondering if they have a new story to tell, and they answered that in the best possible way!

I heard of a few weeks back that the production of Mad Max Fury Road had been moved to Australia to take advantage of new filming laws there, and now comes word that the movie will be called Mad Max: The Wasteland. This was not necessarily the change that people were expecting, but in retrospect, it makes a lot of sense. That film was so good that it doesn’t need anything at all to boost it into greatness. But with this release, you can’t help but think it’s going to be amazing. I just feel that anything that was ever in the first film that wasn’t the big bad is going to be even more incredible this time around. And the fact that this might be the best film in the franchise after the original is just going to put it over the top. We’ve seen so many movies take chances with their source material, but Mad Max: Fury Road is such a massive hit with people that you have to wonder what the thinking was on making a sequel if it isn’t set there. It’s the original. It’s iconic. They’re not going to mess this up with something that you can see coming a mile away.

It’s going to be amazing.

I recently got my hands on a copy of the original Mad Max movie, and man it blew me away. The only problem was, I hadn’t had a chance to see it in a theater yet, and my first thought was: this should be a movie. The idea of Mad Max doesn’t really cross my mind in that way. But with this new take, it all makes sense. It’s such a powerful image, but it just shows how it’s been done and tweaked for the new generation. I went into this thinking that the film was going to be bad, but I walked away from it amazed and ready to see it again.

Mad Max Fury Road is finally opening nationwide on May 15th. While you wait for that to come out, see the rest of these pictures here, and here, and here, and here. I’ll keep updating this post as I find more, but I thought you’d enjoy getting them early!

The next installment in the Mass Effect series is finally coming. We know it’s coming, but now that the trailer is out, we can look forward to it finally coming out. It’s been a long wait, but we can always hope that the long wait was worth it.

A couple of years back, Mass Effect was a game everyone was playing, and the series was a huge hit for BioWare, so it only makes sense that they have multiple video games based off of it, but there was another project that was cancelled.

Well, maybe not “cancelled,” exactly. More like, never really brought to life.

If you were at PAX East last week, you may have seen some of the work that is going on with this. While the game wasn’t officially revealed, they brought a small audience through to experience a glimpse of how the game is coming along, and you can check out a few of the pictures here.

This is one of those games that would have given the Mass Effect trilogy some real competition. It may have gotten in the way of the ending that people were hoping for, but the fact that they were able to work some of the events of the films into the game was impressive to say the least. And then just think about what that means for DLC, a second chapter, something like that. Well, the Mass Effect series was always more about the universe than it was about the plots, and it was only a matter of time before something like this came out.

Not to say that they couldn’t have come out with it in some way without being directly connected to the game. But think about it. This time around you could have done things like put Shepard in a bar fight, and suddenly he would be getting shot in the head. Or… you know what, no. I don’t want to think about that possibility. The game is looking good enough as it is, but now that I know that one of the things I didn’t like about it can be fixed… man, I want to play the hell out of that thing!

I don’t have to be in front of my computer every day to know that things are about to get crazier than they already are.

We all love our comic books. The big two have us covered, but the small press stuff has just become more and more vital to me. I’ve been reading some of the new projects from DC and Image, and they’re some of the best comic books I’ve ever read. I think a lot of us have come to the point where we want to read a comic that looks like a movie poster. And while I can’t even read a comic when I watch a movie, I have to read the ones that are going to be coming out. And with that in mind, you may want to check this out.

For the longest time we didn’t know anything about this project, but now we know the director. We’ve been hearing this comic is going to be big, but the fact that it’s going to be directed by Aronofsky is still really surprising to me. He did take a huge risk and move from Batman for The Fountain, so that tells you that he’s not afraid of things being off of the beaten path.

I can’t imagine anyone but Nolan or a few of the other big name directors coming to the party with the idea of this one. You have to be the kind of guy who can say, “Sure, I can make that into a film,” and Aronofsky is that guy. He would probably have worked on Avatar with James Cameron, but they’re in two different lanes. He’s working in fantasy and I think this is his comic book movie.

When I heard this was in the works, I was really blown away. It’s something that I haven’t even heard of, but now that I know the director is one of the best working today, this is only going to get better. If they wanted him to make a sequel, it may not be a terrible idea.

You know, I wouldn’t mind seeing what he does with this. He’s one of those guys who’s so amazing that he can just do whatever he wants with whatever he’s given. He’s one of those guys that can’t help but be a hit.

There is no question that if this movie is successful, Aronofsky’s career is going to skyrocket, and that’s really the way it should go. I know he’s said this project was in the works before he took the gig on Black Swan, but I just can’t help but think that it was a way to promote his new movie. People just assume he’s trying to take any job that comes his way. They just don’t consider that they’re possibly helping him out.
