No idea how the code of the forum differs from the code of this posting, but try clicking on the post button several times in the right hand side bar. I saw this several times and it took a long time to get my post to go through. Hope this helps.

I don't have a direct answer for you, but I will explain what is going on. And maybe that will help you figure out what you can do about it.
The "post" button in the right hand side of the main forum window that submits the post will only send the post if the "post button" in the forum does not have an error. When you click it and it pops up that small window, the "post button" (if it was a link to your picture) is sending an error. There is no fix for it. That window closes, and the "post button" on the forum is still in its "submitting" mode, so you will only get it to go through after the first time you click "post" after the first error pop up. And the next one after that. The way I get around it is to click "post" 5 times in a row, and then wait for it to go through, then just click on it again once. That works. And this also means your post is now in a "posting" state, and you may want to close that post (and go back to the home screen and select the category you wanted) to continue posting, as this thread will not go through until you have posted at least 6 posts on this thread.
Hopefully this helps some.

Thank you for your explanation. Yes I agree, I don't like that way of doing it. Thanks. I'll try to post several times again after some time. But I wonder why the first time doesn't do that.

As for the code: It is done in "forum.php" (the code for the website), which is included in "index.php" (the code for the website). So if anyone wants to know what I mean. I'm a beginner at website programming, so be gentle with me.

To answer your question, the code that handles the buttons is in that file. You can start in "forum.php" and then in the bottom, there is a section that says "forums.php". After that is the other section that handles the forum. So the error you get comes from the code for the forum.

Your first post is in "forum.php", which is included in "index.php". After you have made your first post, the header of the page you have to include "index.php". You can not put anything else in there, and that's where you get that error.

I also forgot to mention that you can not go directly to the forum section, because there is one thing in the code that blocks it. You have to go back to the home page first, and then click on the forum again. That will open up the forum screen without the "forum" option selected. Click that option, and the forum will come up. Then you can post a message on that page. You can not post on the index page. I will have to look into that one to see how it can be fixed.

I'm running IE9.1.2.0, but it's pretty good at fixing errors and just ignoring them. It does that at least a couple of times, then it gets to posting my post, so I don't really mind. It just feels kind of annoying when it works the first time, you get an error, then you try again and you get a different error.

That can't be right. But let's look at what it is doing instead.
As was mentioned above, the "post button" code only sends the post if the error message pop up is not on screen. If it was (like when you first click the "post button" on the forum), you will have an error message popping up with no error code. This is just something that I noticed while working with php. I didn't go any further with the coding. This is also causing some of the other problems.
When you have the error, you will have to click it a few times to get it to close. That is why the post is in a "posting" state instead of a "submitting" one. I am almost positive that if you put it back to the homepage after the error pops up, and click the "post" button again, then you will be able to post a new message. Then, after you have posted more than 5 times on this thread, try to post. It will then be in a "submitting" state. And you will be able to put the post in the thread after it is done posting. If not, you can just continue posting the same thread.
It's not that hard to fix. You just have to remember where you clicked the "post button" (whether it was the forum, or the php file for this page) to see if the error message still pops up. Then you can just click it the other way (that has the error message displayed) and wait until the page closes. And that will close the error message, and then will work properly. That is all that I can do about it, it is probably a small line of code. But I have yet to figure out how to fix it. If anyone else knows how to do it, I would love to know how.

I had this problem too, but have not experienced it in a long time. I have a few ideas how to fix it. If you use Firefox, you can use the firebug extension to debug the code. You can open that at any time, and trace the error. The best I can think of, if you still have the error on this thread, try clicking on the "post" button on the forum, it should go through, and then come back to the home page. From there, go to the first page of this thread and submit your post. If you don't see it, it means something is wrong with the php. Check the firebug to see if the code is there, if not, then you have some problem. Check if you can edit it in php. It sounds like it is not coming up. (You will also see if it is not being posted, whether the error appears or not)

Just to clarify,
To make it work, go to index.php, get to the forum (there's a button for it now), then go back to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:22
