He then went back into the ring and made his challenge and was about to pin him when Big Show walked into the ring to even the odds. He then hit Bryan with a knockout punch and made his comeback with Mr. Money in the Bank and followed it up with running Kicks to the midsection of Daniel Bryan. After that, AJ came up from behind and rolled Big Show on top of Daniel Bryan and the referee counted three and that was it, Cena was the new WWE Champion of the WWE Championship, he did it once before at Wrestlemania 31 in Orlando last year when he won it from Triple H. I would say this makes Daniel Bryan's reign in the WWE very short lived, but that's only my prediction.

The end result doesn't really matter because we all know who is going to win next week's WWE Title match between Triple H and Cena. That's also it for this week, but I did say that I have a surprise for you. Just tune in to our next segment with more wrestling action on PWTorch Live!

I think Daniel Bryan wins at Hell in a Cell. Cena and Bryan made an epic match a few years back with Cena winning with an Attitude Adjustment. Cena should have won at Hell in a Cell but the show started on time. There are plans in place to give Bryan an advantage, maybe a shot at the title before Hell in a Cell, so expect Bryan to win it all. In the meantime Cena continues to be the face and title of the WWE. Then his run is done and there are plans to do some interesting things. The whole point of the Cena character is to do his thing for so many years and then to be replaced. With all the injuries we've seen we'll see how Cena can fight through them. He has to have to have his heart in the work again.

Trips will keep the strap at the PPV. It has already been stated that The Authority is not happy with either of the two current holders.

I'm sure they'll have somebody take the belt off Trip for a bit and I doubt it's going to go back to Roman.

That sounds about right, but I wonder what the deal with Randy Orton is. I would expect him to show up with Roman at some point in time. Maybe at MITB? Who knows? I wonder if he will have to lose his "title" due to his injury as well.

I'm sure it will work out. Right now I don't see him being able to fight at the level he was at but who knows?

I like Bryan winning the title though, what better way to get the title back to Cena than having Cena give it to him and beat him for it, since it is his title?

Cena is a character who should be fighting to keep the title and I think after Cena defends it at MITB, they can make some "interesting" changes and see how this new guy handles things. It will be good for Cena to show he's a true "face".

After the Money In The Bank match has been made for Cena to win. What will The Authority's reaction be? Triple H has long been champ & has been on top for years now.

Watching AJ try to kick the other H into retirement the last few years while the current champ is limping around on a knee has been ridiculous.

I'm pretty sure Triple H will retain at MITB. I don't think he will lose to Cena again but it will still work because Cena will have to defend his belt.

Cena is not a heel to me. The Authority likes Daniel Bryan who is a great in-ring performer. I love when they get into promo segments with some good back and forth exchanges between Cena and Bryan. I also like the Triple Threat on Sunday Night.

I would love to see John Cena lose at Money in the Bank but if he's not injured then maybe it will happen at Royal Rumble. I guess we will see.

I'm not sure what will happen with Randy Orton at MITB. I hope he wins. It makes sense that he will get a rematch at Royal Rumble for the title.

I don't know how much more Cena can take. He is old now, but he still gets up there and works to go over new talent like Bray Wyatt who has been wrestling for a long time.

If they were to have Cena win the WWE Title back from the Rybacks I would like to see him get a rematch with The Rock to close the show. He's beaten him so many times and it would be great to see them get a rematch at Royal Rumble.

I think it's a mistake to have another MITB match. What they need is to put Daniel Bryan in the main event. It just looks wrong having a MITB match after everyone has already done it and they'll have the same format. The MITB match was changed because they couldn't do what they want to do with Orton vs Cena because he doesn't get to do it. So now they're using the MITB match to do it.

It's like seeing the same movie over and over again. I understand it's not the best movie and has some bad things in it but I still hate it.

I don't really see Daniel Bryan winning the title. I think Randy Orton will win MITB. They will probably have him take a shot on Cena at Royal Rumble and win it at MITB.

No, you're right, it's not that exciting when all the same guy does is win, but for me, the only way I'll get that Cena beat Orton and win the title, was if they kept him the Intercontinental Champion and had him take a match at Rumble to defend against Bryan for the title.

If they are keeping Cena the champion and it's not Daniel Bryan, they would be cheating the audience by having him the champion.

I'm actually wondering why I'm feeling so down on the match? Maybe because last week's show was so much better? Maybe it's just because of what it meant to Bryan to win the title last week, which made it such a big moment for him.

I'm guessing it's because of the last few weeks that the title is around Cena's waist. It has been pretty good over the last year but now it's just kind of... there. I know you don't want to say Cena was boring, but I think he's been a little boring the last few months with the belt around his waist and the way he reacts to the belt. I can only watch him when he wrestles someone like Orton or Punk. The belt has not given me the same enjoyment I got last year when I would</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:53
