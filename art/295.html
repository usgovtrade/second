calculate the odds of winning on a "Pick 4." Let's face it, to many of 
us, picking 4 games out of 7 seems about as likely as getting hit by a major 
snow storm in Florida.   

Well, not so fast. Let me explain how this new procedure came about. Our 
friend Mike McVay, heard us discussing this very problem and suggested a 
brilliant solution. The theory was simple, yet effective and the results 
have been astonishing.  

If you use the Pick 4 method to pick 4 out of 7 games, your chances of 
winning are the same as your chances of drawing 4 aces. Now if you use the 
Martingale System (doubling your bet after every loss) to pick 4 out of 7 
games, your chances of winning are only one in 11 million. There is a 
simple mathematical relationship between these two games. 
The odds of getting 4 out of 7 selections correct are equal to the odds of 
getting 5 of 7 selections correct, times 2, divided by the odds of 
getting 6 of 7 selections correct, times 2. 

Using a calculator or a pocket calculator this would be equal to:
  
Chances of Winning/ Chances of Drawing =  ( 6/7 )^4 X 2 = 6 x 5 x 2 = 120

This same relationship holds true if the odds of winning on one game are 
other than 1 to 1.  
If the odds of winning on one game are 1/2 and you use the Pick 4 system, 
your chances of winning are 1/16. Using the Martingale System, you would 
lose on every try. 


If you would like to see a simple demonstration of how to calculate the 
odds of winning with the Pick 4 System, you can see it demonstrated here:
