In the past year, Joe's also offered a variety of alcoholic drinks, which, as part of a soft open, were available for a limited time during the first few weeks of August. Additionally, the bar plans to experiment with additional onsite options, including more food options, beer and wine, according to a spokesperson for the business.

According to the spokesperson, future drink specials, such as beer and wine, will be coordinated by a beverage distributor based out of Milwaukee.

The space will still be able to provide customers with food and drink options, according to the spokesperson.

The new bar also is expected to have a capacity of about 40 people.

Joe's Bar and Grill will continue to offer its current menu of food items, such as burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs and appetizers, along with several cocktails and specials. However, the spokesperson said Joe's will be discontinuing the "jungle juice" drink menu, which was a popular drink sold at Joe's.

Joe's Bar and Grill is located in the space formerly known as Cafe Lulu.

According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the original Lulu had a liquor license suspended as part of a $20,000 civil judgment in July 2014. The bar also was listed as the site for an Oshkosh-based tattoo parlor known as Tattoo Society Milwaukee.

Joe's Bar and Grill will be on South Oneida Street near East Lincoln Avenue, just a few blocks west of a Starbucks.

The bar will be open from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Sunday to Thursday and 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday.

The bar is aiming to be open as early as 7 a.m. on weekdays.

According to Brew City Times, Joe's Bar and Grill is named after Joe Breen, who operated Joe's Bar on Lincoln Avenue for decades before closing the original bar and moving it to West Burleigh Street and adding more dining space.

Joe Breen opened the original Joe's Bar in 1938, which at the time was called Joe's Place. Breen said he originally opened Joe's Place as a tavern and restaurant serving draft beer and sandwiches.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify information related to the location of the original Joe's Bar. The bar was located on Lincoln Avenue before moving to West Burleigh Street.
