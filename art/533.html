up food and good times in a non-traditional environment.
"A lot of people just come in here to 
talk about their lives and their careers," 
says Dave McLean, one of Joe's managers. 
"They're at the bar, or they're in a booth
or a chair in the corner. It's not 
like other places where people are sitting 
and yelling across the room. They 
just sit and share."
The atmosphere is informal. It's easy to hear 
someone say, "You know, I don't 
know if you're a genius or a fool, but you're 
interesting to me." There's no pressure to talk. 
There's no hard sell. 
McLean says you can feel the warmth 
and freedom of Joe's from the moment 
you walk in the door. "They're just 
welcoming you in. They really want 
you to come in and talk to them." 
Even if you just drop in, Joe's gives you
something to talk about. McLean says 
there's a sense of kinship and mutual 
support among the people who work 
there, and they want others to know 
it. 
"We have some really interesting things 
happen here. It's not just, 'Here's my job, 
and here's what I'm doing. We have, in 
fact, a lot of people from all different 
walks of life who are out there doing 
what they do. 
And to be able to do that in a friendly, 
non-stressful work environment is a 
good thing." 
For the folks who work there, Joe's is a 
place to talk about what they really do. 
If you're interested in talking, Joe's is a 
great place to talk. You can meet people
while you're having your hair cut and 
you don't have to get up early on a 
Sunday morning. It's interesting. 
Joe's gives you the opportunity to 
know people in a more relaxed and 
realistic situation than a business
meeting or a casual day of golf with 
friends or family. It's your chance 
to know that most unusual person at 
the next table. It's your chance 
to find that interesting person who 
works in that business that you're 
interested in. 
People say you won't find that kind of 
atmosphere at their workplaces. 
Joe's is different because it's not your 
average workplace. Joe's is your way 
of not working, a place where people 
do what they do. 
At Joe's, you're not just someone's 
responsibility, you're not just someone's 
employer, you're not just someone's 
client. You're not just some number, 
some statistic that they need to 
meet their quotas for their budget 
or their budget report. You are not a 
statistic. 
For Joe's, it's OK to be you, so don't be 
afraid to be you. 
It's really a very friendly place. 
They're very nice people. We have 
some really interesting things 
happen here. It's not just, 'Here's my 
job, and here's what I'm doing. We 
have, in fact, a lot of people from all 
different walks of life who are out 
there doing what they do. 
And to be able to do that in a friendly, 
non-stressful work environment is a 
good thing.
