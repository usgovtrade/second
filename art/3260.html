Have you No decency?!?!?

To see my friends go! 
Without a Word of protest! 
I have been Told that it's a tradition...
Well it's a damnable notion!
Them going and me left! 
While I'm all alone! 
Can't stand seeing my family suffer!
I don't deserve this!!! 
I have no say in this!!!
Now my dearest friend has been torn from me... 
And it feels so so... 
So unfair...
Just so very, very... 
Unfair!!!!!!

The most I can Do is cry. 
If they go no one can tell me what to do...
Can't talk anymore. 
Everything gets to me! 
I can't stand them leaving here!! 
With all my heart and all my Soul I'll say... 
Farewell Friends! Farewell!!!!!!!
If only I knew how to say that!!!!!
My ears can't take it!
I can't take it no more! 
My chest is empty and my heart is torn!
Will I ever see you again?!?!
Where did they go? 
Will I ever see you again?

My parents have done nothing wrong. 
But still... 
This just leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth.
What was in those drinks?!?! 
Wonder what they did to me?!?!
And I just can't take it! 
Every day I find a new way to be sick! 
How many more days? 
I don't wanna live!!! 
Why'd they make me come! 
Why'd they keep me here?
I'll just watch. That's my job. 
That's how it always ends for me... 
It's hard to take... I try... 
I try...
But I just can't be bothered!!!!!
I should have stuck with Puddles instead!
Now they're gone forever... 
They did it!! I know they did it!!! 
I can't trust a soul here... 
Never will! Never again!!!
My new friends, they were just a part of me.
When they go, my life is through... 
Never will I ever see another day!!!
Please, please help me... 
If I was on a street, would you stop?!?!?
Them going and me left without a Word of protest.
I have been told that it's a tradition...
But it's a damnable notion!!!!!

I have no hope that I'll ever see them again... 
Can't even look at them... 
I know if they come back, they'd be gone again... 
But what I'll do when they do?!?!!!?
Why?!? 
Why did they do this to me?!?!?
I don't know.
I don't want to know. 
I just want to stop this pain.
Please... Just help me. 
Where did they go? 
I have to know.
Where did they go?!?!!?

I've got so much to say, but my brain is slow.
I gotta get off of this chair, but my legs are slow.
I gotta get off of this floor, but my legs are slow.
That's all it takes to kill you!!
This is not a joke! You've got
to get off of this floor.
You've got to get off of this chair!
No joke! You've got to get off
of this chair. If you want to leave
the place where you've been
locked up. I think you'll be
surprised about the door. 
It's not like normal doors, I'll tell you right now.
For example, if you push on it,
it doesn't open at all. 
If you push on it, it doesn't open at all. 
If you push on it, it doesn't
open at all. If you wanna leave,
it's gonna cost you and a lot more.
It's gonna be an expensive deal,
and it's gonna make your friends'
lives miserable! Get off of
this chair. No, this is not a joke!
Oh, you are so stupid if you do not get off of this chair.
The next few lines should just
apply to a chair like this.
The next few lines should just
apply to a chair like this!
So get off of this chair.
Yes, this is not a joke!
Ohhhh ohhh oh! oh!
Get off this chair, 'cause if you do not
get off this chair, we're going
to have a problem! No!
Yes, we're going to have a problem!
Now, it's up to you to move your chair...
It's up to you to move your chair.
There is a very large spider down here!
Go! Get out of the chair!
Alright.
The next few lines...
If you're in a chair, it's time for
you to get out of the chair! I know,
because there's so many
people here. Are you ready?
I know, because there's so many people
here. They want you to get out of the chair.
The next few lines should apply
to the chair, in which you are.
The next few lines should apply
to the chair, in which you are.
There is nothing funny about
the next few lines! If you sit
in the chair, it's time for you
to get up from your chair.
There is nothing funny about
the next few lines!
Oh, I'm sorry! 
Are you ready for the next few lines?
The next few lines should apply
to the chair you are currently in.
So, get up from your chair.
Oh, that's right. I'm not going to take it anymore!
Do not sit in that chair.
The next few lines should apply
to the chair you are currently in.
They shouldn't do anything funny to you!
Do you see the spider in that picture?
Can you see the spider in that picture? 
Get off of your chair!
We know you're not moving.
It's time for you to leave your chair! 
There is nothing funny about the
next few lines! If you sit in that
chair, you are asking for trouble!
Are you ready for the next few lines? 
Ohhh! ohhhh! ohhhhhhh</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:51
