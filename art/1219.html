You need to read his words. You need to allow yourself to have him in your thoughts.” Now that is, to use a Keillor phrase, just the kind of response that he deserves.

As the AP’s Jason Dearen wrote, “[Keillor’s] brand of humor was never quite for everyone, but it is indisputably beloved by those who know it.” That feeling was certainly shared by his fans, who took to Twitter with tributes like this:

You’ve lost me, Garrison. I’m sorry. But your kind words will guide me as I try to survive now. pic.twitter.com/yPjBfXc4cH — Lili Marlene (@leililililima) August 28, 2016

Our friend the incomparable Garrison Keillor is gone. His gentle voice will live on in our hearts and in the many millions he brought joy to over his long career. #GarrisonKeillor pic.twitter.com/3H6h1yK3q5 — Bobcat Goldthwaite (@BobcatG) August 28, 2016

I had to stop playing Christmas music after Garrison Keillor began playing his. Just doesn’t feel right this year. — jerryandcarole (@jerryandcaro) August 28, 2016

A lot of you will never know what that felt like. I just lost my dad a few months ago so when I heard about Garrison’s death, I felt like a stranger, left wondering how a person could suddenly just die away from all of his family. — Lacey Daws (@LaceyDaMoon) August 28, 2016

Others appreciated the way Keillor used his own voice to represent regular working people in an everyday, real-world context.

Garrison Keillor was one of the only radio hosts I listened to during workouts. He brought me such joy with his simple stories and humor. #RIPGarrisonKeillor — Kylee Lye (@kyleelye) August 28, 2016

And of course, there’s that classic:

That’s just how it is, Garrison Keillor and his beloved brand of mid-western humor. We’re sad to be saying goodbye, but this is one time it’s OK to celebrate.

We’re glad to see Twitter still works that way.

We’re also glad to see the internet still works that way.

Keillor wasn’t the only man accused of making it all up. And Garrison can rest in peace knowing that all men are created equal.

He will never be missed. pic.twitter.com/d0CvqRybK7 — Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) August 28, 2016

And he will never be “The One.”

That’s what most of us thought.
