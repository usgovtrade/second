the need to minimize development cost and timelines and the continuing 
emphasis on ensuring that Enron provides innovative and standard 
solutions that protect our customers. 

In order to address these requirements, we are refocusing our internal 
engineering resources on building commercial products by leveraging our 
proprietary product development tools, when possible, and freeing up our 
engineering resources to be more responsive to customer needs. 
Additionally, we are working to ensure that development processes are 
coordinated and consistent across all platforms and products.

Effective immediately the following will be our main priorities:

+ EnronOnline

  Development of new software engineering and process controls for rapid 
deployment of new functionality. 

+ Transactions

  Enhancement of current transactions to support near-term shipping risk 
mitigation.

  Working with global IT to leverage our trade risk management technology 
sold to customers

+ Middle Office Risk / Back Office Systems
