Fake ICO’s

Now, this one might not be too common yet, but it’s just a matter of time before this becomes more widespread and common. At the moment, there are so many different ICO’s and token sales that it’s virtually impossible for someone new to the crypto-world to know which ones are genuine and which ones are fake. There are hundreds of different scams and investment tricks out there, and a lot of them share the same names and symbols as real projects. So you have to do your homework and find out if a project you’re looking into is legit or not.

Fake wallets

The crypto-world is becoming more sophisticated and mature every day, but there’s still a lot of space for scam artists to operate in. From fake ICO’s, to fake wallets, to fake exchanges, the fraudsters don’t really care about getting caught – so long as they can trick an unsuspecting person or an inexperienced investor into thinking that their project or platform actually exists. One of the most common tricks that these fraudsters use is to copy and paste a certain project’s wallet address – or even the entire wallet address, but that is usually only for scam wallets anyway. When you use these wallet addresses, they usually end up sending you some weird and obscure coin which nobody has ever heard of.

Fake crypto traders

To be honest, the crypto-world can get pretty cutthroat and competitive – and we mean that in a very positive way! No one wants to be outsmarted or beaten to the punch when it comes to investments. But at the same time, it can be really easy to get yourself confused if you’re not well-informed or have not done your homework. So when you’re new to a particular market or ICO, it can be really easy for someone to scam you if you don’t do your homework. Which is why it’s crucial that you stay on the lookout for people who look too good to be true. You might want to avoid these scam traders, because if they’re legitimate, they’re probably making a killing right now – and that’s not a good look for you.

There are a number of ways to check that an ICO or token sale is not fraudulent and is legitimate. In this guide, we’ll be talking about websites that let you know whether or not an ICO is authentic or if it is a scam. There are also a number of apps out there, most notably CoinStaker that allow you to carry out these checks, but there is no need to download a third-party app when you can check everything right here.

ICO Tracker

First, you have to go to the ICO Tracker website. This website is extremely handy for new investors, since it allows you to easily check whether or not a project is a legitimate ICO. This website is designed to give you all the information you need in an easy-to-understand format, and in an instant. You can also instantly see the team behind the project and view their past works.

Token Prices
