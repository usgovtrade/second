The authors present 5 observations of closed injury to the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space due to traffic accident. The severity of the injuries to the retroperitoneal space depended on the severity of traumatic impact of other organs. Abdominal bleeding occurred in 4 patients, retroperitoneal hematoma occurred in 1 patient. Diagnosis of retroperitoneal space injury was made in 3 patients. It was established by means of a clinical examination combined with diagnostic ultrasound and roentgenography. In 1 patient laparotomy was performed during which a retroperitoneal hematoma was diagnosed. A conclusion is made about difficulties of differential diagnosis and the necessity of the complex use of diagnostic methods in patients with injuries to the retroperitoneal space. The possibility of retroperitoneal injuries should be taken into account as an indication to the surgery in traumas to the abdominal cavity of a certain severity. The injuries to retroperitoneal space constitute a considerable source of morbidity and are a cause of death among patients who suffered from severe polytrauma.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:07
