While many fans are more aware of the players involved in these trades than the executives who made them, it should come as no surprise that each of the teams involved was hoping to get more from the deal. Here’s a look at the three most likely (i.e., not necessarily most likely) reasons each team was hoping to make this deal.

Jets (most likely): Jets GM Mike Maccagnan didn’t draft a quarterback last season, but if Sam Darnold can be the guy they think he can be, that may change, opening the door for a trade. Maccagnan could look to improve the team’s pass rush.

Ravens (most likely): Baltimore GM Ozzie Newsome is the executive who helped make the deal. He drafted Jackson and knows he had a special player in Jackson. The Ravens need to get younger at the position, and bringing back a dynamic receiver like Brown could be helpful as they try to figure out what to do about the quarterback position.

Bills (most likely): Buffalo is loaded in the secondary, but the pass rush and run defense could use some work. Getting an impact edge rusher could help the Bills improve on both. Plus, this would be coach Sean McDermott’s first foray into free agency as a coach.

In a very competitive quarterback market, trades are the one way teams have to improve without having to spend on the position. There aren’t many trades that can put a team in the driver’s seat, but this one would have done that, and for the Ravens and Jets especially, it would make sense. For the Bills, a deal like this would have set them back as their core of talent is set to hit its primes. Now, it could make them significantly better by bolstering their pass rush and their defense.
