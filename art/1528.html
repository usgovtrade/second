"I am your God. When you have studied this chapter and
prayed about it, I will meet with you. You will not have to ask me. I will
tell you what to do. I will tell you how to apply what you have read
and learned in your daily life. You will have a sense of the joy, peace,
and freedom that only comes when you know and love me. My Spirit inside
of you will help me bring you the things you need for the difficult
times, times when evil attacks, and times when my people are wandering
lost and alone."

"The first covenant was like the
blood you gave at the Last Supper. It sealed the pact between us. The
blood was like an invisible bond, made of spirit but not visible. The
bond was there, yet you were not bound. You were still you, and so were
I. The bond existed but you were free. At the Last Supper I said to my
disciples, 'One of you will betray me.' That's why Jesus said, 'One of
you will betray me.' But in a way, all of you did. The same ones who would
be rejected in a way betrayed me and the church. This is why I said,
'This is how I choose to be betrayed.'"

The Teacher talked about Jesus' death. "He trusted
that the Father would provide a way for the world to be put back into
order through his death. All of this happened while you were watching and
waiting. For your part in this tragedy, you could have stopped it from
happening by turning from sin, repenting, and believing the Good News."

"Do you see, children? God is able to save you, if you
believe in him. You can’t believe in him if you refuse to accept me as
your God and Savior. You need to know that your God and mine are the same.
This life is so unfair. It has brought suffering, pain, and sorrow to you.
There are people who like to see you suffer."

"There were a few people like this in the first covenant.
These were the Scribes, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees. When the first
covenant ended, I took some people away from those groups and formed a new
one. I called them, The Church. But I didn’t create a new group just for
some people to keep things the same. I didn’t make a separate building or
buildings for them to meet in. I wanted them to meet with me in a way
that was new and unheard of. They wanted a new place where they could
enjoy my presence. They wanted to experience my blessing and favor. That
was the only way they would be able to experience me."

"You and I cannot be separate from each other.
However, we also can’t be apart. I know that hurts you. That’s why the
church was founded and exists so that you could learn how to deal with
these difficult situations. It’s why you are here now. You are going to
face some difficult times in your life. You will find that your desire to
run away from the situations will not work. You will fail when the going
gets tough. You will find that it is easier to run and leave than it is to
come back and trust me. I know because I was there before. I know that
when you run, it leaves a void. The void never goes away."

"Your life is more than food and drink. You need more
than the basic food that you eat. Life, itself, is a gift from God. It’s
up to you to make the most out of it, to not be like some people who go
through life with your hands tied behind your back."

"I want you to think of your future more carefully.
Don’t become so attached to the things of this world that you are missing
out on the great and wonderful things that my plan has for you. I want to
make a place for you at my right hand. That is what I want. I want to help
you in every way that I can."

"I didn’t come to be the biggest, loudest, and most
important one in the crowd. I didn’t come to have that power over your
lives. I came to be one of you, to live among you, and to die for you. I
came to stand among you and speak in a human voice, not a human voice that
humans can hear or understand. I came to tell you things that you need to
know and to show you things you need to do."

"How can you be happy? What can you do with what I have
told you?"

"Do you know how to love? Can you love your neighbor?
Can you love them just as well as you love yourself?"

"Don’t you believe that I sent Jesus to die for you?
Don’t you believe that Jesus suffered for your sins? Don’t you believe
that because Jesus died that I can forgive your sins and help you face
the difficulties that life will bring? I made all of this happen. I can
make your prayers come true. Don’t look at this as a test. It’s just a
small sign of my desire to be your God. You can see the good I am doing
for you and for all of creation."

"Can you still reject me and say that you don’t
know me? Can you still turn away from me? Don’t you see me? Can you really
close your eyes and ears and not know me? If I were to die right now,
wouldn’t that be too bad? Wouldn’t you be really sorry? If that’s true,
then know that I am there, and it’s up to you to respond to my presence.
The truth is that you will not be able to deal with the things that will
face you in the future without me."

"The truth is, you cannot be the son of God without
accepting me as your God. You cannot see me and live, without accepting
me as your God."

"So what does the second commandment say?"

"Again, I want you to listen carefully. The Good News is
not something that you can choose to believe or not believe."

"It’s not something that you can reject, or that you
can accept. It’s not something that you can give or take away. It is only
something that is given to you by God. It’s only there because he wants
to give it to you. He wants you to have the opportunity to come to him.
He wants you to know that he is there for you and in you."

"You cannot reject me and still expect to be
invited into heaven. You cannot refuse to obey me and still expect to be
accepted by me."

"I’m not saying that you can’t decide to leave me.
There is nothing wrong with that. Some people can and do decide to leave
me. But when you do so, you make it harder on yourself. You’ll never be
able to live without thinking about me. I will always be with you."

"I see you. I have always seen you. I know that there
are many things you haven’t told me. But I know you well enough to know
that you are good. It’s only because you don’t know what I know that you
do the things you do and that you say the things that you say."

"I have so much love for you that it hurts me. I am
sorry for the times when I hurt you and the times when I failed to be
there for you. I know what you need and how difficult your life is. I
know how hard it can be for you. If you truly know me, then I hope you
know how sorry I am. I will never stop trying to help you to do better,
and I will always care for you. I will always be with you."

"Children, don’t run away. Don’t turn away from me.
If you come back to me, you will find me there. I will accept you and
forgive you. I will love you. I’ll never stop loving you. When you come
back to me, all the suffering and rejection you’ve endured will go away.
You will begin a new life that is better than anything you can imagine.
Even now, my Spirit inside of you wants to encourage you, help you, and
comfort you."

"I have given my Spirit to you that you might know me.
I want my Spirit to always be with you. I want you to never turn your back
on me. You will find me always at your side."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:06
