of a man named G, they thought there was 
probably something really, really bad 
going on, so they called 911.
Now if you do not want 
this to happen to you, you might want 
to look at your credit card because 
there's some pretty alarming stuff on there.
The card number was supposed to be encrypted,
there's the expiration date, the code 
to validate the card number, and then
the card number. If it looked like this, 
that would be really bad. They saw something 
look like this and they wanted to cancel it 
right away, but you can't cancel an expired 
credit card, right? Instead, they bought 
new credit cards that looked like this 
in a last ditch effort to rid themselves 
of the bad 
looking card.
"The suspect was identified as a white male 
in his early 20's, height about 6'3 
weighs about 225 pounds, grey hair 
a thin nose, and a mustache.
The suspect had a red backpack with 
an emblem of an eagle over a shield.
The suspect might be carrying 
a large knife.
The suspect is extremely dangerous 
and may have killed before.
Please call 911 immediately if you have 
seen the suspect."
Now this is one of the things 
you always want to know.
What are you looking at? 
They are looking for some 
sort of indication that you're doing something
illegal, that you're doing something that 
would cause you problems. Most often, 
this is because they're actually afraid 
of people who look like you. They have 
seen your Facebook, they've looked at 
your Snapchat, they've seen your text 
messages, and it looks like you're doing
something really, really bad. 
"Cops are investigating the source of a 
letter they got containing anthrax and 
white powder." Oh no! What did you do? 
"We suspect that whoever 
wrote this letter was mad at 
a local judge because he ordered 
the release of a teen who had been in jail 
for over a month for driving without a 
license, or for possession of synthetic 
marijuana, or maybe because he shot a 
neighbor's cow.
Whatever the reason, the writer decided 
to take the law into his own hands. He 
also sent white powder to six others in 
the county." Now if you get a letter like 
this, what would you do? "When I opened
my front door, the mailman had just left 
my doorstep, I opened the brown bag in my
hand and the mailman looked so surprised
to see me that I became terrified, which 
was about the only thing that kept me 
from being sick." Wow.
If you get something like this, 
you might want to know, 
am I in danger of getting arrested, 
am I safe, can I take this letter to the
police, or is it something to turn 
it into the FBI? 
"As you can see, I did not 
take the letter to the police. I took the 
letter to my dad and we put it in the
wood stove." 
"It's a new trend in the middle
schools. Parents are angry that students 
are dressing up in costumes from movies 
and video games to take pictures with 
other students. The trend has grown to 
the point where parents now have to have 
their kids police the hallways and report 
any suspicious characters to school 
officials. They're also required to get 
students to open and turn their locker 
doors before they can go in." How do I 
know if I should stop and check or not? 
This is a very good question, 
should you be checking your back in the 
parking lot or the shopping mall. 
"Do you know who you're 
looking for? Are they wearing black 
and white? Would they scare you? 
Let the police know." How do I know 
if they will arrest me?
That is an excellent question, 
they might. "Police arrested a teenager
who left several packages, including 
wrapping paper with marijuana inside it. 
The teen was arrested and his mom 
has been ordered not to interfere with 
her son. This case underscores a serious
issue facing parents, 
and that's should they should they check 
for any strangers who might be lurking 
around your child? And can they interfere 
with this teenager?"
It can go back the other way, 
and you know what you do? 
You call the police right away, 
it's not easy, but you do it right away.
We have talked about the problem 
before, 
most often 
police response times 
can be 10 minutes to an hour, or even 
more in some cases. Now if you send in 
this information, you've done a really 
good thing, but there's something 
else you should be thinking about.
"They've given you some advice here, 
you should tell your neighbors 
right away if you've seen anyone 
wearing a black mask in front of your home, 
so people can look out for each other.
The next thing they have told you is to 
move to a safe location. What that means 
is you need to get in a place where you 
can wait for the police to arrive if 
there's something going on, because you're
still in danger even if the police arrive.
Again, you need to know what the threat 
is before you can act, so be prepared to 
know how to act." This person 
is telling you to take measures.
There's no question that these 
threats, the white powder ones, you need 
to contact the authorities right away. 
Then there's the gun threats and the ones 
where you're talking about the police 
wearing your stuff as a mask, 
in that case you can do whatever you want.
You can tell your neighbors, you can contact
the police, it's up to you, 
it doesn't affect me. Don't let people 
talk you out of getting the things that 
you need, you know what to do. 
And again, if you have some kind of social 
media, or social media that you keep track
of, you can post it, you can share it.
We talked about this. 
We were on the front page. 
We were on your Twitter feed. 
You're not that important. 
That's it for today. 
Please share these things with your friends.
I will see you next time. 
Have a good day.
Bye. 
Bye. 
That's how to stay safe online.
You may not always think of them that way, 
but they are.
You stay safe, keep yourself 
safe and your family safe,
thanks for watching.
