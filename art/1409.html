The documentary premiered on January 30, 2014. The documentary is directed by Alex Gibney.

The documentary focuses on Belfort's schemes, called the "Wolf of Wall Street" program, and his use of hypnosis to attract money from investors. Belfort's company sold stocks with high-risk promises of enormous returns.
