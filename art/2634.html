# FRESH BEET BREAD

Makes 4 to 6 servings

T his bread has a fabulous beet-red color.

½ cup dried onion flakes

½ cup dried bell pepper flakes

1¼ cups boiling water

1 tablespoon instant yeast

3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour

1 cup dried beets, ground in a blender, no-sugar-added ketchup, or canned beets, finely chopped (not necessary if using beets in ketchup)

1¼ cups walnuts or pecans, ground in a blender, or purchased finely ground walnuts or pecans

½ teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon nutmeg

  Preheat the oven to 325°F.

  Combine the onion and pepper flakes in a heat-resistant bowl and pour on the boiling water. Let stand until lukewarm. Meanwhile, stir the yeast into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the soaked vegetables, walnuts, salt, and nutmeg and beat well. Gradually add the flour to the yeast mixture and knead well, incorporating the dry flour a little at a time. The dough will be quite moist.

  Punch down and turn out onto a lightly floured board. Knead in enough additional flour to make a fairly stiff dough. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Flatten each piece with your hands to form a 10-inch round loaf. Poke a hole in the center of each loaf with your finger and pull up the sides to form a ball. Place the loaves on 2 ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 40 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before turning onto wire racks to cool.

# WHOLE WHEAT CINNAMON BREAD

Makes 12 servings

½ cup dried currants

½ cup water

1 teaspoon instant yeast

½ cup maple sugar or sugar, or sugar substitute to equal ½ cup

1 cup boiling water

3 cups unbleached white flour

1 cup whole wheat flour

1 teaspoon salt

2 teaspoons baking soda

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1 teaspoon nutmeg

½ cup dried apple, chopped

½ cup raisins

 Preheat the oven to 375°F. Put the dried currants in a large bowl. Cover with hot water and set aside until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid. Add the maple sugar or sugar substitute, the 1 cup boiling water, and the drained currants to the bowl of a stand mixer. (If the currants are very dry, add up to ½ cup more boiling water.) Attach the paddle, and mix on low speed, then increase to medium speed, beating for about 3 minutes. Add the 2 cups unbleached white flour, the whole wheat flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly. Grease a bread pan (9 × 5 × 3 inches) with cooking oil. Turn the dough into the pan and let it rise, uncovered, for 2 hours. In a small bowl, soak the dried apple in the reserved currant liquid for 10 minutes, then drain. Drain the raisins. Make 12 evenly spaced holes in the dough and gently press the raisins and dried apple into each hole. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack.

Add the yeast mixture and beat until well mixed. Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead vigorously for 10 minutes. Put into the bread pan, seam side down, and sprinkle with rosemary. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise for 1 hour. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until golden brown.

 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a bread pan with cooking oil. In a small bowl, combine the yeast and cornmeal. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of the honey in ¼ cup warm water. Stir in the yeast mixture and let stand for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the flours, salt, and remaining honey. Add the yeast mixture and beat until well mixed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Turn the dough into a 9 × 5-inch loaf pan. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise for 1 hour. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool before slicing.

# APPLE AND PEAR BREAD

Let stand for 5 minutes, then stir into the flour and salt. Gradually stir in the yeast mixture, the lentils, and ½ cup water to form a loose dough. Knead for 3 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. Knead in the nuts, mixing thoroughly. Turn out onto a floured board, divide into 3 pieces, and form into 3 loaves. Place on lightly greased baking sheets and let rise for 20 minutes. Brush with the olive oil, then make 3 diagonal slashes in each loaf. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the bread sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on racks. Cut slices and spread with peanut butter.
