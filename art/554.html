spending so much time at the gym," she wrote. "When I am away, I am away, 
but I always make time for myself. Please re-examine your priorities and how 
they make you a good wife and mother." 

You've got to be kidding me...I responded right away, "Not gonna happen. 
Don't worry about me! You and mom both know that I'm completely devoted to 
you two. I have been for 22 years, and I'm not going anywhere. However, I do 
have a life of my own, and I do sometimes have girlfriends over." 

Okay, so she knew that I'd been dating. It happens. And what do you know, 
right after I responded that email, I ran into a girlfriend from the past 
(very brief and sporadic). She was a little surprised, and commented that I 
seemed to have gotten my life back. 

So I have to say that, actually, I am seeing someone I kind of like, and we 
have a relationship that is probably more than platonic. I know that we're 
not going to be a couple, but I think we can be good friends. In fact, after 
spending a day with her, I found myself making a list of ways that she's 
remarkably like my ex. 

I am determined to get back into the dating swing of things. I also want to 
live, eventually, a more single, independent life. But I don't want to have 
to try too hard, and I don't want to be too "ready." Maybe I need to work on 
my game? I don't want to waste my time though...all of this will just mean 
another date, or breakup, if nothing else. 

Oh, by the way, I am having a wonderful time hanging out with the kids. I 
actually haven't just been visiting them. We hang out at home, too, and have 
been having a lot of fun getting the house cleaned and ready for the new 
school year. 

Oh, I asked my dad about the ex-boyfriend's new wife. And it turns out that 
she's much younger than we were, and that she had the hots for him, even 
though he was married, and I think that my ex might still have had them for 
her. How pathetic. What a bitch...but oh well. 

I hope you all had a great weekend! 

Love, 

Antoinette

I went to the gym after work today, and talked to the women's group leader 
about going to the Fitness Exchange to get in better shape. She said that I 
should bring my friend Kana, since she doesn't go there too often. It was so 
nice to be at the gym with other women, and I think it's going to help a 
great deal. I haven't been there for about a month because of some things 
that came up at work, and as much as I try, there's really no excuse for me 
not to go back. 

You know, when I was at the gym, I got a phone call from my friend "P," and 
she told me that one of my girlfriends (we haven't seen each other in like 
five years) was driving to LA and would call me on her way. I got this 
e-mail from her yesterday, and I think that we are going to be great friends. 

Antoinette, you really had to be my own personal trainer. I've gained about 
15 pounds in two weeks. I'm really glad that I am happy with the weight 
that I've lost. The scale doesn't mean anything...especially not when you 
look in the mirror. 

Okay, so I got three messages from you all this evening, all of them saying 
the same thing...you're not writing to me. What the hell... 

Anyway, I have to run and pick up some medicine for my mom, so have a great 
night. 

Love, 

Antoinette

Babe, 

I don't think I can give you the same advice I gave before. You know the 
stuff about being more independent and whatnot. 

I also don't think you're ready for love, and don't think you need it. It's 
no good to live your life waiting for something, you know? I think you need 
to date around a little more, and become a little more independent and 
strong, so that you're not so dependent on a relationship. 

I also don't think you're at your right place in life to give love. When you 
know what you want in life, you might be able to be a better lover, I 
guess. But for right now, just do the things you're doing, and keep living 
life to the fullest. You're a nice person, Antoinette, and a lot of the time 
I think you're really aware of what is happening in your life. 

It's just that you're confused a lot, I think. 

And you're not being yourself. 

I care about you, I really do. It's not a secret. You know that. And I just 
wish that you would take this moment to think for yourself and to become a 
stronger person, not just for me, but for yourself. 

Lots of love, 

Dee

Hey Ant, 


Hey, can you do me a favor? Please call me. I really need to hear your voice 
tonight. 

I miss you so much, baby. I just had a great conversation with a friend, and 
I really needed someone to listen to me. I have a lot of things I need to 
talk to you about. 

Love you, talk to you later.

Okay, so I guess the summer went by really fast. I haven't had time to write 
to you all in a while...there are so many things to talk about that I don't 
know where to start.  

First of all, I started a job! I've been working on the "Polar Express" doing 
set-up and teardown for a couple of days a week, as well as being a ticket 
taker. I really don't make a ton of money, and the work is definitely hard, 
but I'm a lot better about my diet now, and I've lost about 5 pounds since I 
started. They told me that I have to go to a physical tomorrow, because of 
back problems I have, because I am the heaviest person on the crew. I told 
them I don't think I'd be able to fit into the one piece of clothing that 
they gave me, so I'll call and ask to get some more clothes. 

Speaking of clothes, let me tell you that I love Victoria's Secret. I got a 
pair of new panties and a bra there yesterday. The underwear is great, but 
the bras have no band. I don't know if you know this, but that's not a good 
thing if you're big-chested. And I love Victoria's Secret. Do you ever go 
there with Dee? Anyway, these are probably the only good things that I have 
to report. 

I will be going to a birthday party with a bunch of my friends on Saturday 
(after this e-mail). It's either your birthday or sister's. We are going to 
eat at this restaurant with an all-you-can-eat salad bar, so I will give you 
a quick update then. 

I am really getting into the spirit of school. I have a bunch of friends now, 
and I'm going out a lot. We are organizing a "school night" thing, which 
means staying out later and going to movies and eating dinner, and 
generally having a good time. 

Love you, 

Antoinette

I haven't written lately, since I've been working a lot, but school is 
starting in a couple of weeks, and I have a lot of homework. The summer went 
by really fast for me. I got a job on the Polar Express working as a ticket 
taker. I have to stay at work until at least midnight, and there is no 
bathroom, so it's not an easy job. I've been gaining weight a lot lately, so 
I've been trying to stay away from eating as much junk food. I do that most
