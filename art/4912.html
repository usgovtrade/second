Disney

The show takes place a few years after the "Star Wars" episode "The Phantom Menace" (when a young Padawan named Ahsoka Tano is learning the ways of the force) and features an adult Ahsoka. The show picks up between the end of that film and the beginning of the next. It will follow the Clone Wars, a conflict that takes place between the Jedi Order and the Separatists, a war between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

"When it comes to the character of Ahsoka, there are some very fascinating stories to tell about who she was in her early years and her relationship with this incredibly unique relationship with this young man who becomes Darth Vader," Lucas said during a meeting with investors. "There's so much story to be mined there, so much new information, that you'll be seeing a lot of Ahsoka."

Lucas also told investors about the upcoming Clone Wars animated series. The 13 episode series will air on Cartoon Network. Disney did not announce any premiere dates for the show.

Lucas also said that Star Wars-themed attractions are in the works for Walt Disney World and Disneyland. A Lucas-themed ride is scheduled to open in Hollywood Studios in 2011.
