"You're kidding." "I've just got here." "Why don't you go out and get yourselves a pizza?" "Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with it, it's just a little different." "I'd like to see somebody try to order a pizza." "Go on, get yourself a pizza!" "You're not allowed to order pizza at night, are you?" "No, I think it's more likely you'll eat your own face at this time of night, actually." "Go on, go out!" "It's all right." "I'll deal with you in a minute." "If you're going to be out, would you do me a favour?" "Get me the number of the girl's house and I'll stay here and keep an eye on the kids." "The name's on the form by the phone." "All right, I'll see you in a second." "Thanks." "Sorry about the pizza." "How are you doing?" "You all right?" "I've been asking myself that for about a month." "Thanks." "This is nice, isn't it?" "Nice and warm." "Yeah, they've got us watching telly now." "Right." "I was going to see you tonight." "I've been trying to phone you but they wouldn't put the call through." "I'm sure it'll be all right." "It was because I'm in the cell." "They did warn me." "I know." "Come on, let's not talk about that now." "I've got some great news." "What?" "Nothing bad, I hope." "I'm out of that bloody cell, and I've got some work at the University to start on Monday!" "Oh, great." "But there's something I wanted to ask you about." "Sure." "It can wait." "Just something I wanted to ask." "Sure." "I'm really pleased for you." "It's just that I'm going to need a bed on the night." "You could sleep on the sofa for tonight." "I couldn't." "I'm quite used to it, but I wouldn't want you to think..." "What, that I'm the kind of guy who sleeps with the door unlocked?" "It's not you." "It's my girlfriend." "Why can't she get it herself?" "Well, it's..." "All right, I'll tell you." "She's afraid you're not coming back again." "Well, she'll just have to get used to that possibility, won't she?" "Yes, but if she thinks you're dead, she won't be so worried that you'll come back and..." "You don't need to worry about that, I won't be coming back!" "Right." "Have you got your knife and gun with you?" "Yeah, I think so." "You're quite a character." "I don't know what the fuck happened to you in that cell, but you're not the same person." "Well, what do you mean, I've changed?" "I don't know!" "Well, change!" "Well, why?" "Well, we don't need all this talking, do we?" "Now, let's not stand here arguing about this." "You and I don't seem to be able to talk properly lately." "I'm tired of all this talk." "And so am I!" "Do you want me to come up for a cup of tea?" "All right." "I won't be a minute." "You sit down." "Keep the house in order." "Come on." "Right." "Hi, Steve." "Oh, hi, Sarah." "How are you doing?" "I'm all right." "I'm going home for a couple of weeks soon, if you're wondering." "Well, it's only two weeks since you went to town." "What's the problem?" "Well, it's just that some woman has got her eye on the flat." "You mean she's been in the flat?" "Yeah." "She was." "She was looking around." "So?" "Well, she doesn't need to do that, Steve." "And she came in when you were at work." "It's not fair, Steve." "She's been snooping." "Look, Sarah..." "Do you want me to look after the kids for a bit?" "Just for a while." "No!" "And as I said, I haven't seen her in the flat." "Well, I haven't seen you either." "I don't know how you found your way in, but you shouldn't be nosing around in people's flats." "I said I didn't want you to, and that's that." "Are you serious?" "Yeah." "I don't like to make problems, but she's been round there again this morning, by the way." "You'd better get yourself a decent room in town before it's too late." "The man you were with on the night you got arrested might have come up with something, but I doubt it." "You'd be the one, wouldn't you?" "What?" "Oh, nothing." "You can go off to that place, I suppose." "Leave me on my own again." "This is all I fucking needed." "And if you take some fucking liberty, the least you could fucking do is let me know in fucking advance." "Just so that you can tell them I'm dead." "You know, I'm gonna go to the police and see if I can get your bail cancelled." "Don't!" "Why not?" "I told you, I'm gonna ask them about us." "Oh, great, they'll have it on film for you to watch again." "I wish you wouldn't, Stephen." "Just don't, because if you are going to do that, you can get me arrested for perjury, for fucking perjury." "I'm not gonna have you making a fool of me!" "You can just fuck off back to wherever you've come from, the fucking police think I'm a liar, then I won't get a trial or get out of prison." "Stephen, I don't want you to go back to prison." "And I don't want to go back to prison either." "Well, I'm not telling them that." "I want them to see for themselves that I'm telling the truth." "I've told you what happened." "You think you know now." "You're gonna have to prove it at your trial." "That's what the court is for." "If I put in the evidence, what happens?" "And I'll be putting it in, will you?" "I won't be doing anything of the sort." "And what happens?" "We know all about that police procedure." "They'll just ask me a few questions, and I'll say yes and no." "Don't be silly." "Anyway, you said that as soon as they let you out, you'd come straight back to me." "Well, I am coming back to you." "I've had time to think." "I know now that the only way that I can get them to believe me is by telling them the truth, because then they'll have to take me seriously." "And I know that what I have to do is to tell them exactly what happened." "And if that does turn out to be perjury, it's too late to worry about it." "I'll have to take that risk." "I'm sorry, Steve, but that's how it is." "Stephen?" "I love you, Sarah." "And I'll get out of prison for you." "Stephen, please don't say that." "It would break my heart if you did that." "Yeah, well, it's true, though." "Let's just get back to normal, shall we?" "I mean, we're not just starting all this." "I don't know what to say." "Well, what about a cup of tea?" "Yeah, that'd be nice, yeah." "That'd be really nice." "All right, sweetheart." "What can I get you?" "Tea?" "All right." "Tea's fine." "You don't want milk or sugar?" "No, not for me." "Nothing?" "Nothing." "Thanks very much." "Sure?" "Mmm-hmm." "Are you looking for someone?" "Who?" "Her?" "Yeah." "With a name like this?" "What about it?" "Aren't you going to use it?" "What, for a password?" "What, do you do that?" "Well, you've got to be a bit careful, haven't you?" "I mean, people just get things wrong." "Got you." "You're not..." "I was just..." "God!" "Is it me?" "Did she say it was a guy?" "No." "How long were you together?" "Only three months." "It was her husband." "Jesus!" "Jesus!" "No!" "Why?" "I mean, he can't..." "I mean..." "Why?" "Why does this always happen to me?" "Stephen, if I ever hurt you, I'd never forgive myself." "It's me that's hurting you now." "I didn't have to be there." "You don't have to be there any more." "I'm right here." "It's all right." "Oh, I</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:42
