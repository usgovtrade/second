The first two years were all about figuring out if we were making bunny stuff the way we really wanted to. The early years were almost all custom work, and that is what made us want to make a bunny of our own. The design for Bunny came from a small group of customers who asked for a big, friendly bunny. This led to the design of Bunny and then our quest to improve the model. To us, Bunny has always been a personal pet bunny. He has no other purpose but to bring happiness to the one person who sees him the most often. We knew it would be difficult to capture the true spirit of this friendly bunny in any kind of a toy. So, Bunny was designed for us to bring our love of bunnies to our customers. We feel blessed to be able to do that. We are glad you take some time out to enjoy him with your family.

Bunny is made of super soft vinyl. He is 10” long when stretched out, and 6” across his ears. Bunny is made with love and care by a small team that cares deeply about each and every one of our friends. We invite you to enjoy his simple pleasures with you. He has won many best toy awards and is sure to be a family favorite.

In the words of his creator, “I believe Bunny will keep the love alive for generations to come, just like he is doing for so many of us.”

Catch it, Bunny is made with love, by a small team that cares about every single one of our customers. He is available now. Be sure to keep checking back for future Bunny releases.

A big thanks goes out to everyone who joined in and helped us make this one a success! Enjoy the photos below, and visit us at BunnyBunnies for more great bunny love.

Bun Bun is back with a brand new, awesome series of limited editions: We think Bun Bun is the perfect toy for those who love their pets just a little bit, like we do! We knew he was going to be a hit when we named him after our favorite TV show growing up.

The Mutt. The Goat. The Furry Pig that has more than a touch of magic about it. The one that makes you laugh. The one that can drive you crazy. The one that makes you smile.

The one and only BunnyBun is back, and available for pre-order NOW! He comes with a free hug. Pre-order and a very limited amount of huggable soft stuffed bunny friends will be sent along with the Bun. All those huggable bunnies will be the cutest you’ve ever seen.

These are just a few of the many new features we have implemented for the 2014 models. We’re all about making the most loveable pets we can, but we also love making their toys the best they can be too. So we made a few changes to make our bunnies the best they can be and available again.

If you loved us in the past, you will love us more this time around. We are ready to make your 2014 BunBun pet the best toy for you and your family.

So it is with great joy we bring you the second of the BunBun releases!

Just a few weeks ago, BunBun (bunnies, get it?) debuted in his series of new adventures. The BunnyBunnies are as cute as can be, and they have already won a TON of awards. The BunBun was first introduced to the public in June of 2013. We had fun with these guys, and we learned a lot from you about the kind of pets you love. The last of our BunBuns is now on sale.

We made a few changes this time around and have been working on a new line of products that are still in the concept stages.

We have decided we are excited to launch our new line of Furry Pets, Bunny Bunnies, and Bunnie Tweety Tweets. Our new line will be a bit less detailed, and a bit more fun and cuddly. Bunnies are cute, but they are also fuzzy little creatures with feet that can scratch and hurt if they aren’t properly cared for. They love to run. They love to play. They love to jump. And, they just happen to be completely crazy and insane for attention. But they are also the cutest little guys you have ever met.

Please note this is an art doll in a cute rabbit suit. The actual bunny may look very different.

The bunny is only 4 inches tall when stretched, and about 3 inches wide. When stretched out, he measures 7 inches long. The eyes are painted, and his feet are stitched to his feet. He is made of high quality felt. His facial features have been sculpted. He is a small bunny, similar to a pet bunny. This toy bunny comes with a FREE hug!

This is the perfect size for giving to a child in the house as a companion, or a great pet for a kid that has outgrown a baby bunny. He is also suitable for older kids and young teens. The huggable soft stuffed bunny friend has been created for kids aged three and up. That’s the age of innocence, right? Of course, he is also perfect for those who want to teach children about love and friendship by having this cuddly companion as their family pet. He is a great way to help teach children how to care for animals, and care for themselves as individuals.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:34:31
