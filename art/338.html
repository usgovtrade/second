looking for a 'best friend'...or else you will be really bored in your

Thanks, 
Tiffany 

P.S. If you know someone who has been searching for a long-term, 
committed relationship with a warm-hearted, caring man, please send them 
my way!  I'll do anything to get out of my present relationship, and I'll 
make them a better man than their last boyfriend. I'll be their slave if 
you want. Just don't take all my cocaine away, that's all I ask.
