I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things. 
Chris:  Why didn't you come after me last night? 
Pete: Oh, are you kidding? I had a date. 
Chris: You are such a punk. 
Pete: Shut up. 
Chris: So do you work here? 
Pete: I don't even go to school here. 
Chris: Really? What school do you go to? 
Pete: Dosomething. 
Chris: Dosomething? You got to go there. They are way too good for me. 
Pete: Your loss. 
Chris: What do you do? 
Pete: I am trying to fix the copier in the "A." 
Chris: How's it going? 
Pete: I don't know. I think I may have it fixed. 
Chris: The hell you know. 
Pete: Hey, we are in the library. Anybody want a drink? 
Chris: Yes. Let me get it. 
Pete: I'll get it. My friend. 
Chris: Here you are. And here's your change. 
Pete: I can take care of this. 
Chris: What's your name? 
Pete: Peter Petrelli. You can call me Pete. It's a nickname. I got a 
class. 
Chris: You go to college? 
Pete: Yeah, I do. 
Chris: What are you studying? 
Pete: I just graduated high school. I want to be an architect. You know, 
I do. 
Chris: You like to draw? 
Pete: I love to draw. Look at that. 
Chris: What are you doing after graduation? 
Pete: What are you doing? What are you doing? 
Chris: I'm going to college in Boston. 
Pete: Oh, right, yeah. Well, I'm going to Dosomething in New York City. 
Chris: Do you go to Dosomething, too? 
Pete: No. I wanted to go to Dosomething, but I didn't get in, so now I'm 
going to dosomething else. 
Chris: Too bad. Maybe next time. 
Pete: Yeah. Maybe next time. 
Chris: So are you going to stay with anybody in New York? 
Pete: No, I am not. I mean, I couldn't. 
Chris: You want to share an apartment? 
Pete: I live in an apartment. 
Chris: How much is it? 
Pete: It's pretty expensive. 
Chris: How much? 
Pete: 14 bucks. 
Chris: For now. 
Pete: I can't believe it costs so much. 
Chris: Well, you get what you pay for. 
Pete: How much do you pay? 
Chris: It's none of your business. 
Pete: Oh, is that right? Are you a spy? 
Chris: I'm not a spy. You know what? I bet you have never even looked at 
a real girl, have you? 
Pete: Well, how do you know? 
Chris: I just know. Look. 
Pete: What? 
Chris: This girl is something. 
Pete: What? 
Chris: Why don't you try to get in her pants? She probably won't give it 
up. 
Pete: Try this girl. This girl has her own problems. 
Chris: So do you know what I am going to do now? 
Pete: What are you going to do now? 
Chris: I'm going to go to her. And I'm going to say to her, "Have you ever 
seen a beautiful girl, you want to go out with me? My name is Pete. My 
father owns the whole town." 
Pete: Great. 
Chris: Are you still going to watch me go up to her? 
Pete: Yeah. 
Chris: So I'll just be sitting there? 
Pete: Oh, it'll be a while. 
Chris: How long is a while? 
Pete: About two years. 
Chris: So, if you were me, would you go up to her? 
Pete: You never know. It's a whole new ball game. 
Chris: Yeah. 
Pete: You could take her out. 
Chris: I don't know. 
Pete: Don't you think you ought to? 
Chris: What am I going to talk to her about? 
Pete: You can talk to her about anything you want to. It's your choice. I 
can't tell you what to do. 
Chris: Can I walk around with her? 
Pete: Sure, you can. 
Chris: Do I have to talk to her? 
Pete: No. 
Chris: Can I just, like, hold her hand and walk around the room? 
Pete: Sure. 
Chris: Let her try to find somebody else to talk to. 
Pete: You're going to talk to her. 
Chris: And try to get her to watch me? 
Pete: Yeah, why not? Why not? 
Chris: How about if I talk to her? 
Pete: You're going to talk to her. 
Chris: Talk to her. Talk to her. Talk to her. 
Pete: What am I going to say to her? 
Chris: I don't know. Talk to her. 
Pete: What do you want me to say to her? 
Chris: Anything. 
Pete: What are you going to say to her? 
Chris: I'm going to ask her, "How are you doing?" 
Pete: How are you doing? 
Chris: No, no, no. Don't use that one. 
Pete: Why not? 
Chris: Because, because she will say, "Great." And I'll say, "Really." 
Pete: Yeah, great. 
Chris: And then what will happen? 
Pete: We'll go outside. 
Chris: You want to get out of here? 
Pete: Yeah. That's what I want you to do. 
Chris: Why don't you just tell her you are leaving. 
Pete: You are leaving. 
Chris: You are leaving and you want to know if she wants to go. 
Pete: That's a good idea. 
Chris: What do you think she will say? 
Pete: Fine. Let's go. I'm leaving. She's going to say, "Fine." 
Chris: But what if she says, "Where are you going? I want you to stay. 
Pete: We got a plan. We go outside, right? 
Chris: I think she will say, "Where are you going? I want you to stay. 
Pete: We got a plan. We go outside, right? 
Chris: Yeah, but I don't want to. 
Pete: We got a plan. We go outside. 
Chris: Why do you keep saying that? 
Pete: Because we got a plan. We go outside. 
Chris: It's got nothing to do with you. 
Pete: We go outside. 
Chris: You can't make me. 
Pete: We go outside. 
Chris: You don't know that. 
Pete: She will say she wants you to stay. 
Chris: We got a plan. We go outside. 
Pete: She will say she wants you to stay. 
Chris: We got a plan. We go outside. 
Pete: She will say she wants you to stay. 
Chris: I will. I'm telling you right now, I will. I'm telling you right 
now, I will. 
Pete: We are going to find out. We are going to go outside. You are going 
to be a good boy and we're going to go outside and I'm going to say to her, 
"Please, let's go out. I want to talk to you." You know how to talk to a 
girl. All right? 
Chris: Yeah, but I'm not going to go outside. 
Pete: But it's a lot of fun out there. 
Chris: I'm not going to go outside. I like it in here. 
Pete: It's a great night. 
Chris: What do you like about it in here? 
Pete: It's warm. The girls are beautiful. You know, they are very warm. 
Chris: They are cold. 
Pete: No, no. They are beautiful. 
Chris: What are you looking at? 
Pete: They are beautiful. 
Chris: What do you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:05
