<span style="font-size:10pt;"><b>Internationalisation</b></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
In a few years, we have become a significant player on the Spanish market, 
with our own offices in four out of the major cities, and branches in other 
regional capitals. We have also been active on a global level since 1994, 
when we launched our operations in the United States.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
Thanks to our high level of experience and our knowledge of global markets, 
our team of around 400 employees have achieved the highest level of 
internationalisation possible. This has allowed us to acquire a solid 
reputation as an international company, with the result that we are one of 
the most awarded companies in our industry.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
All our projects focus on new technologies, be it through the application of 
the latest methods in software design, or the implementation of new 
communication systems. In short, we always push the boundaries of technology 
and know-how, and this is our main competitive advantage. Our team of 
engineers, after all, is unrivalled in the world of information systems.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
To support all this, we have developed a wide range of proprietary systems 
which control our processes. We have also invested a great deal in training 
our personnel to the highest level of software development, in order to ensure 
greater efficiency and better quality in our services. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
In this way, today, TECNOSSIS is a leader in every aspect of our industry 
and is recognised as such by the great majority of our clients.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
We are also a solid company which is recognised for its reliability. We have a 
strong capital base and an enviable reputation. Today, TECNOSSIS is a company 
with a capital base of 200 million euros, and sales of over 14 million euros 
annually. Of our 400 employees, most of them are working in Madrid.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
All these factors ensure our solid position in the market, since they ensure 
our capacity for growth and an unassailable future.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
Finally, thanks to the enormous demand we have been receiving, our capacity 
for growth means that we can continue to serve our clients better and better 
in the years to come.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
Our company is very dynamic, with all the elements in place to ensure that 
our future is a very bright one.</span></p>

Company history</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
TECNOSSIS began in 1992, with the founding of the company by two partners, 
Carlos Carcas and Ricardo Cernadas. Carlos and Ricardo are well-known 
personalities in the information technology sector, and they have created a 
competitive company which represents the technological cutting edge, based on 
innovation and knowledge.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
TECNOSSIS initially specialised in hardware and communications technology, 
and was soon expanding its range of activities, by supplying software. In 1993 
it won the first award ever presented to a software developer, and since then 
our reputation as the leading IT firm has grown considerably. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
In 1997, TECNOSSIS acquired its first offices outside of the Madrid area, in 
Barcelona, and in the same year, it formed a consortium with Microsoft which 
brought Windows NT to the market. This same year saw our expansion into the 
US, with our offices in Silicon Valley and Seattle. In 1998, we inaugurated 
our Barcelona offices, and the following year we took control of Argencom, the 
enterprise department store, as a strategic investment.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
The year 2000 marked the beginning of major change in the company. It was 
the year in which the initial public offering of TECNOSSIS shares took place, 
with the aim of funding a more aggressive international expansion. With that 
initial public offering, our shares were put on the stock market.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
Over the last few years, we have continued to invest in our infrastructure 
with the aim of taking the best quality IT services to market. 
In 1998, we launched our global operations</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:19
