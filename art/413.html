make an impact on your environment.

When used in conjunction with our patented DRS (Dust Reducing System) 
sachets, it helps reduce the amount of dust in your environment without 
compromising the air quality.  In addition, it helps reduce the amount of 
dirt brought into the environment.

The product, when used in tandem with the disposable sachets, creates a 
unique two-part system.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Coal Plant Emissions
Enron has agreed to letters on environmental issues from 10 coal burning 
power plants in the US. These plants emit 10.6 million tons of carbon 
dioxide equivalent per year making them the largest source of emissions in 
America.

Power Plants can improve their environmental performance by using 
best-available control technologies such as waste heat recovery, improved 
efficiency, or environmental amnesty, and in some cases all three. EPA 
expects the real environmental benefits of these improvements to be 
significant, potentially reducing emissions from these plants by over 25% 
compared to baseline.

Enron has also developed an innovative emissions reduction strategy for 
itself called the Power Performance Contract. These contracts provide 
emitters with an allowance, per megawatt hour of emissions, which can be 
banked against emissions from other projects.

Cement Plants
Cement is the second most produced manufactured commodity in the world, and 
by some estimates consumes more than 3% of the world's fresh water supplies. 
In an effort to reduce reliance on freshwater, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) is encouraging the development of innovative 
technologies that will enable cement plants to recycle waste water resulting 
from the manufacturing process, while also cutting emissions of the 
greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.

A technology called cement-stabilized recycled aggregate, or CSA, has been 
used for more than a decade. The European Union, Japan, and China all have 
plants that use this technology. The American Concrete Institute and the 
American Society of Civil Engineers recently launched a study to determine 
the viability of using CSA in the United States.

Enron technology has also been used successfully in Europe, Japan, and 
Australia. However, we are not currently using it in the United States. 
Possible application of this technology in the US would also help cut the 
nation's growing demand for energy by increasing energy efficiency. 

Volatile Organic Compound Emissions
Several studies have shown that the application of volatile organic 
compounds, or VOCs, can reduce the environmental impact of solvents. Enron 
has been a leading proponent of the use of VOCs, and in the mid-nineties 
began to develop systems to capture VOCs from various processes, including 
the printing industry. 

One of the world's leading studies in this field was conducted in Europe 
with support from the United States. The study focused on the application of 
a solvent called N-VOC, which is a byproduct of gas turbine power plants. 
Enron has been using N-VOC since the mid-eighties as an environmentally 
preferable alternative to solvent-based processes. The use of N-VOC reduces 
carbon dioxide emissions by 90%.

Enron has also developed technology for the capture and treatment of VOCs 
from the cement and plastics industries. Waste streams from these industries 
that do not contain VOCs are normally incinerated, adding to the formation of 
greenhouse gas. However, since VOCs are energy intensive to incinerate, they 
are often burned, which accounts for 10% of the total volume of hazardous 
materials released in the United States each year.

Enron technology can treat these waste streams without the need to incinerate 
the volatiles. In addition, the captured VOCs can be used as feedstock for 
the production of gasoline and other fuels. Several plants using this 
technology have been built in Europe, Japan, and the United States.

Carbon Dioxide Capture/Sequestration
One of the biggest producers of carbon dioxide in the world is the burning 
of fossil fuels. If captured, carbon dioxide can be used as a fuel, a feed 
stock for the production of chemicals such as methanol and dimethyl ether, or 
a source of energy. Currently, carbon dioxide is not used as a fuel or feed 
stock because of the enormous expense of capturing and transporting it.

Enron technology, in combination with other companies, has been able to 
remove carbon dioxide from a gas mixture that comes out of a steel mill and 
uses it as a feedstock to produce basic chemicals. While the price of carbon 
dioxide is extremely volatile, the price of the chemicals produced is less 
volatile and is less expensive than alternatives.


PROTECTING OUR ATMOSPHERE AND OPERATING SMOOTHLY

To protect the environment, Enron has developed a range of technologies, 
including tools and methods for controlling emissions at the source and 
practices that will allow us to operate in a more environmentally 
sustainable manner.

Our efforts include technology to monitor and verify that our contractors are 
properly applying for necessary permits and licenses as required by local, 
state and federal law; development of new technologies to reduce NOx, SO2 and 
particulates; and development of new technologies to monitor and verify 
compliance with existing environmental laws and operations.

Enron has created an innovative new partnership with the University of 
California at Berkeley and the University of Virginia to study ways that the 
two universities' cutting-edge research can be used to develop new, 
low-cost technologies that will help Enron reach its environmental goals.

Enron, which has invested more than $55 million in our parks and habitat 
conservation program in the last seven years, will continue to work with 
organizations such as the National Park Service and the EPA to help protect 
the environment in balance with our economical development of our energy 
assets.
