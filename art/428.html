automatically create and control an unlimited number of 
synthetic web pages for testing. This has been designed for the 
programmers of E-Commerce and Database Applications in 
order to check the layout of web pages and the contents of
all items. This is an exclusive new tool. It is called 
"Web Site-Generator". The only limitation of this tool is 
your imagination.

In addition, we've added a shopping-cart to Web Site-Generator. 
The shopping cart uses the latest ASP.NET script engine, which 
is so fast that it requires no page refresh and there is no 
delay in updating order status. Your customers can place orders 
in a matter of seconds. This is a great time-saver for web 
developers, especially for eCommerce applications. The shopping-cart 
is easy to set up and customize. In a word, it is the most 
powerful shopping-cart on the web. A list of the many 
other advantages of shopping-carts using the latest ASP.NET 
script engine can be found at:
http://www.e-biz.net/demo/web-site-generator.cfm?demo_username=demo
We have also included support for our E-Commerce product database. 
Using Web Site-Generator, you can test hundreds of thousands of
products at the same time!
The database contains hundreds of thousands of products with 
all the popular features of product description, prices, 
pictures and so on. You can also search for products with 
a simple and powerful search engine.

The shopping-cart is very flexible. It will work on any 
platform and with any kind of database (even a text file).
You can design your own database table (using fields of any 
names, sizes, and types), import data from an Excel worksheet 
(using any data file) or use the E-Commerce database with
any programming language (including C, C++, Pascal, Perl, 
Python, Java, and Delphi).

The "Personal" version contains the program and the sample data. The
"Professional" version also contains three additional features:
* You can create as many databases as you need.
* You can import data from an Excel file.
* You can generate a file to be imported by any other system. 
* You can import the data from our web sites. 

The files generated by Web Site-Generator can be imported by any other system, 
including the products in other databases such as Amazon, Yahoo! Shopping, 
and ZapShops.

be released as free upgrades to all current users.
