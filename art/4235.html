The fingerprint itself, of course, is not recorded in any manner; rather, the pressure exerted by the ridges and valleys in one's fingerprint causes certain changes in the electrical properties of the surface which record the fingerprint image. Typically, a finger is rolled on a non-conductive planar surface such as glass or a Plexiglas panel and electrical contact is made between the finger and the surface to monitor electrical current flows as the ridges and valleys of one's fingerprint pattern are pressed into the surface. The resulting changes in the current flow are a function of the impedance of the valleys and ridges of one's fingerprint pattern which vary as a function of one's fingerprint characteristics, such as ridge width and valley width.
Known devices for scanning finger impressions operate on a number of principles of measuring surface electrical impedance. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,038, issued to Kamath et al., entitled “Sensor of Fingerprints”, a method and apparatus for recording and identifying fingerprints is described which includes an array of sensors mounted adjacent a digitizer in which the sensor may be either a variable reluctance sensor, an electrostatic capacitance sensor, a magnetic sensor or a photoconductive sensor.
Another approach is suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 4,725,846, issued to DeLuca et al., entitled “Optical Sensor for Identifying Surface Topography of an Object”. There, an optical sensor is employed which utilizes a broadband illumination source and a detector which monitors the reflection characteristics of a finger that are caused by diffraction effects. An image processor compares successive images to determine if a match exists. A fingerprint sensor that utilizes light reflection from the finger is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,553,837, issued to Kenchington, entitled “Capacitance Sensor and Method”.
Other devices that utilize optics and photosensitive detectors are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,448, issued to Fulks et al., entitled “Contact Printing Apparatus Utilizing Light Reflectance”; U.S. Pat. No. 5,182,049, issued to Carter et al., entitled “Capacitive Sensor” and U.S. Pat. No. 4,353,056, issued to Tsikos, entitled “Fingerprint Scanning Arrangement”. Other capacitive devices such as that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,300, issued to Synder et al., entitled “Capacitance Sensor with Integrating Storage” utilize a system of drive lines to drive fingers in a predetermined pattern and a sensor circuit which includes a switching arrangement that can sense a different capacitance of the finger or a nonconducting area, which in turn is used to produce an electrical output.
Unfortunately, while these systems have advanced the art, they have often been difficult to manufacture and cumbersome to use. Moreover, many fingerprint scanning systems have been expensive to produce and/or difficult to use. Accordingly, a need has been identified for a fingerprint scanning apparatus that can be easily manufactured and used for accurately identifying fingerprints.
Additionally, fingerprint identification systems should be operable in a variety of environments, such as those which are poorly lit or have little or no background light, such as where fingerprinting is to occur at night or where ambient light is dimmed by a cover over the fingerprinting site. However, where the system requires an intense or directed source of light, such as a focused light source, the prior art devices have not been adaptable for use in such environments. Therefore, a need exists for a fingerprint scanning apparatus that can function in both a variety of ambient light conditions and in conditions where highly directed light sources are necessary.
Fingerprint identification systems should also be operable in conditions that are extremely wet and where oil or moisture from fingerprinting would tend to cause failure of electrical components. The fingerprint scanner should be capable of effectively and reliably fingerprinting individuals with oils or water present on their fingers. Thus, the need exists for a fingerprint scanning apparatus that is operable in harsh conditions, such as on damp or oily fingers, or in environments where contaminants, such as oils and other impurities, are prevalent.
Further, a need exists for a fingerprint identification system that is operable in environments with elevated levels of electromagnetic radiation, such as at frequencies in the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Further, a need exists for a fingerprint scanning apparatus that can operate with and collect fingerprint data through the non-visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as infrared wavelengths, for improved identification. Moreover, a need exists for a fingerprint identification system that can operate with and collect fingerprint data through the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as the blue portion, to obtain image data for improved verification of identity. Still further, a need exists for a fingerprint scanner that is not affected by temperature extremes. Additionally, a need exists for a fingerprint scanner that does not fail when moisture collects upon the surface of the scanner.
Still further, a need exists for a fingerprint scanner that is small in size.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:13
