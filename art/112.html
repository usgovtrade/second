Instead  
of following the trail of food,  
I began to make my way through  
this long field of the shadows  
between the earth and darkness.  
And there I waited.

I could hear its footsteps as it  
came towards me. It drew nearer,  
more shadowy than  
I'd ever thought it could.  
Its heavy, loping  
steps, the clatter of leaves  
and twigs as it scratched for  
what the tree-covered darkness  
beyond held.

**_M_** ousetrees rustled. Winded,  
it stopped. I held my breath,  
my heart frozen. And then it  
began to howl. It sang its terrible  
sound that had the power  
to take us as we wished  
to play, and make us  
beasts in that forest.

Not so far away now,  
a dog howled in response.  
The air filled with  
dog-whines, yelps, and howls.  
A strange, rumbling murmur  
began to fill the forest.

And now the howls  
became human cries.

I heard them  
shouting into the night.  
Calling for help. "Save us!  
Save us! Please! Please  
help us!"

The forest became  
a house of darkness.  
The shadows came into the light  
as a crowd of humans  
moved down the shadowy aisle.

They didn't look like  
any men I'd ever  
seen before. Like  
beasts, their coats hung down  
over their bellies, their  
paws like great,  
muddy boots. Their fingers,  
their faces  
were the dark forms  
that could become

the forms  
of hungry things  
or beasts.

All of the human forms  
moving down the aisle of  
the dark forest began to

howl, and sing, and dance  
as one. Shapes appeared  
out of the shadows,  
and they walked out  
to join the others.  
Gripping weapons,  
some of the humans

who'd  
joined them were  
hunting dogs. The dog-hounds  
came, sniffed, circled  
around my body. Then  
they picked  
me up by the neck  
and tail, and flung  
me high into the air.

So. I began to feel  
the light of the sun  
begin to shine again.

**_Y_** ou've just seen a bit of  
the last of my book, the  
end of an adventure  
I've been having  
and writing  
for a long time.

It's also a bit of  
a warning. I know  
you're a good  
reader and you don't  
want to have  
a bad surprise.  
I've made all my  
worst mistakes,  
and my books  
are full of errors.  
Don't get my books  
if you don't like

errors.  
You'll soon be  
sorry.

Read on  
...

**_S_** o, enough of the  
first part of my book. It's  
the last I'm going to write  
about my adventure  
at the end of the century.

Before I begin  
to write about  
my second life,

I must talk  
a little more  
about what happened  
at the end  
of the century.  
To me it was  
an adventure.

**_D_** o you believe in  
a lot of fairies, or elves,  
or little people  
with green-colored coats  
and long-fingered hands?  
Believe me, they're real.  
If you think  
I'm just making them up  
so I can be  
the center of attention,  
I've had some things happen  
in my life  
that might make  
it seem as if I were  
crazy. But it's the truth.

I can remember  
a time before  
I was  
grown up, when  
I'd played  
and talked to  
the creatures  
that came out  
of the forest  
at night.

Sometimes they  
would have babies,  
sometimes they  
would be playing  
with them, and sometimes  
there'd be many, many  
animals.

Sometimes  
I'd play with them  
by talking to them  
just like we talk  
to animals.

This is what  
I do know.

There was one little boy,  
much younger than I,  
who I'll call Peter.  
He was born, I think,  
on the eighth of April, 1820.  
That was the day  
of the last sunstroke  
that Peter,  
and I have ever known.  
That was also the day  
when I met  
the man who became  
my second mother,  
and his kind of human mother  
who, with her dark eyes and  
soft brown hair,  
helped me become a human  
for my second life.

She worked hard to teach me  
the language of humans  
and to teach me human ways.  
And I think she did  
a lot more  
than she'd ever  
dreamed she would have  
to do.

She brought me up as  
her own. Then, as I grew,  
she took me to live with  
my first mother, who  
was a queen  
in her land, and she was  
a very good  
human mother.

**_T_** he forest of my childhood  
was a part of  
my second life.  
I'm sure  
you know forests  
the way some people  
know the streets  
of cities.

The forest was my  
home, my world.  
I lived and played in it  
all the time  
I wasn't in  
the house  
with my mother.  
Sometimes we'd  
ride our bicycles  
into the forest,  
and I'd play  
with the animals  
and humans who lived there.

Other times, I'd sit  
on the bottom  
of our pond, watching  
the creatures come  
out of the water to play,  
or to go fishing, or to hunt.

Or I'd swim with  
my cousins, and go  
for a ride on  
their small horses.  
But the best  
part of the forest  
for me was the day  
my second mother  
would take me  
on her  
hunting trips.

**_A_** great big wild dog  
was the first  
one who looked  
at me. My heart  
had stopped  
beating as  
my mother  
had picked  
me up by the tail  
and thrown  
me up towards  
its face.

The dog stood up.  
Its large,  
dark eyes stared  
into mine,  
with an expression  
of great friendliness.  
Then I began  
to remember  
being a  
baby and looking  
into the eyes  
of those huge  
dogs that had  
been my friends  
while I was  
playing with them  
at the bottom  
of our pond.

I felt  
a great rush of love,  
and I was almost  
too frightened  
to hold my breath.  
Then I heard my  
mother's voice.  
"Don't cry.  
Don't cry.  
The dog will  
not hurt you.  
Please don't be  
afraid</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:08
