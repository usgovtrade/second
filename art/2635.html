[A] The grimalkin.--T. Burnet.

The last line of this charming fragment of metrical romance,
written by Burnet in the year 1762, illustrates the Scottish
use of _wa’_ or _weel_. The allusion is to the traditionary
exploits of the knight Sir Bevis, and the expression means
simply ‘He lives somewhere,’ or ‘is not dead.’ “Bevis of
Southampton had some connection with a district in Norfolk,
where Sir Bevis is mentioned in a number of old documents, and
where this old knight was doubtless frequently visited.” The
legend is one of the tales which have survived in popular memory
throughout Europe since the middle of the fifteenth century. Sir
Bevis, with a bodyguard of one hundred and one knights, one dwarf
and one fool, pursued the giant King Anguish, who fell into the
sea near Bosham, and as he did so the waves washed away the
knight and his party and all their horses but the dwarf and the
fool, who were carried by the tide into a cave, in which they
were left to drown. But they took heart of grace, and by
singing--

    O Lord have mercy on our soul!

accomplished their deliverance. It is said that as they reached
the shore, Sir Bevis and the dwarf were picked up by a boat, and
the fool in like manner by a passing vessel, so that the whole
were preserved. The giant being drowned, Sir Bevis became, as
Burnet says, “a great warld-body.” He and the dwarf are supposed
to dwell in a cave near Chichester, while the fool wanders all
over the country and lives at large, and all day long on the hill
on which Chichester Cathedral is built. When any one meets the
fool he must

    Give him a groat, and run for your life.

He has all the power of making himself invisible, and he is always
welcome to a meal at a rich man’s table, “for whaever sees Bevis
gives him a groat.” He is much given to drinking of ale, and, as
he is in great awe of Sir Bevis, is in the habit of saying to
those who invite him, when the knight is at home, “that he canna
venture to gang in the tap till Bevis has eaten his porridge;”
and if he is asked why, he says, “his master is sae great a man
that he would kill him.” This invulnerable warrior being ready to
come to an engagement with all manner of giants and monsters, and
to go hunting all over the world, while at the same time he could
go on all-fours, or, like a cat, sit on the roof, and thus go over
the hill, was so much talked of that the people of Chichester
imagined that they heard a horse moving, and thought he was still
alive. Thus the tradition came down from age to age.

CHAPTER IX.

ALEXANDER AND THE KNIGHT-ERRANT.


[Illustration]

Such is the history, as it has come down to us from ancient time,
of Alexander, who performed all manner of marvellous exploits; and
hence he is now, by common consent, styled _Saint_ Alexander; so
that we may be very certain the appellation was given him in his
lifetime, and not long after his death. That he was a Scotchman,
the very name of Alexander is, we may observe, peculiar to our
nation; and moreover he may have belonged to the south-west of
Scotland, his first master being the prince and conqueror of
England. There are several circumstances in his history which
agree with the tradition that he was originally of Pictish blood.
He is said to have been a native of Annandale, and this would
agree with the old Celtic tradition that the Picts were born in
the island of Manann, or Mona; and from hence the island was
called after them, _Pictavia_. That he was born in the West, in
the reign of Henry the Second, and in the province of Ulster,
is well-known; that his family came from the highlands of
Aberdeen or Aberdeen-shire is more questionable; but at least
that his forefathers were Scottish by extraction, which may be
supposed from the ancient Gaelic names he used. His mother was
said to be a princess, and we know he had a brother David, who,
with his wife and daughter, visited him in his captivity in
Ireland; the brother is said to have been a valiant and skilful
swordsman; and some have imagined him to be the original of the
Dalmatic. Many of the family of Alexander had the name of _Bane_,
the Gaelic for the same word as the English _Bane_, which is the
name of the spirit in the great majority of the tales of our
ancestors, who used to appear to them and give advice in various
practical affairs. According to these notions, the name may have
been given to Alexander from his having had two children called
_Dalmatic_, one of whom lived; but we can hardly presume this,
though indeed he may have died in a _natural_ way, as children
often do. Alexander was a great _boast_ of his ancestry; but he
also seems to have been singularly addicted to a _boasting kind of
society_. His friends, some say, boasted the more boldly from his
lack of courage and modesty, and called him a coward; upon which
he, in a fit of passion, drew his sword, and cut off the hand of
one of them, saying he would show the world who was the coward.
We may believe that he did this out of bravado, and to vindicate
his character; but if his temper was soured by a long and bitter
captivity, nothing is more common in his history than to boast
and be abused; for he seems to have been often ill-used in the
course of his life. He may be said to have been in captivity to
the English from the year 1214 to the year 1217. On his return
home, as he found himself in want of money, he went into a deep
ravine in Perthshire, at a place called Loch Doon. There he met
with a band of twenty Scots, who were all but naked and starving.
They had no means to procure the means of life but by committing
robbery; and as Alexander found them well qualified for this
undertaking, he made a partnership with them, and thus went
through two years of hardships together. After this adventure he
accompanied them in many other depredations; for, like all who
come to want, he was always a great stealer of other men’s
things. From these circumstances arose the report that he had been
a robber in his youth; but he has several times told us that his
first depredations were on the French: for his original design was
only to make love and be made love to by the female-kind; but as
soon as he heard that he had an opportunity to lay a</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:49
