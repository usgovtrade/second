The above chart is for an average player, not for a superstar. For an average player, this is a very good set of stats, if it’s the only stats you’re looking at, that is. They may show that your opponent is more than likely to be making plays than you, but that doesn’t always translate to wins. The other statistics below will shed some light on that.

Including KAST and KILL, this represents the total amount of damage taken and the number of kills that a player is averaging on all characters. The reason this does not work with all characters is that the damage that a player is receiving could be due to the person doing it or it could be from someone doing it to them. The kill chart shows you the number of different characters that a player has been hit for the most damage, and the damage chart shows you the characters which are dealing out the most damage. These are good indicators of who is doing the most damage to you, and if you are a big champion for your team. The lower damage chart shows you which characters are only hitting you for the minimum amount of damage. If you’re seeing a lot of ‘0’ in the amount of damage charts, then you should probably try to farm more. These statistics are good indicators as to which player is performing better than you, but they are not a guarantee that you will win. Many other factors can be used to determine the winner, such as the damage done to the opponent and the amount of damage given out by each team. However, this analysis should be enough to determine who the better player is.

Now that we have seen that each of these champion, in this scenario, is only averaging one death per game, let’s go back to our first chart, and see what has happened to the first part of this equation. What has happened to the amount of kills that a player is receiving?

Player Kills

Our first glance at these stats gives us a much better picture of the champion. This is a lot different than before, the champion no longer has a 50% chance of dying with a kill, but he also has a 75% chance of not dying with no kills. You can see that the player has been hit with the least amount of damage and received the fewest amount of damage. These stats make the champion look pretty good, if the opponent isn’t hitting you for the most amount of damage then it’s no wonder you haven’t been hit that much. There are still reasons why this player might not win, as I mentioned earlier, this only applies to one single player for one game, whereas in a team-based game there are 5 players involved, and no player could receive as little as one death per game. In that case, I highly doubt that player will not be the most successful player on his team.

It is obvious that if you perform well in the above 3 statistics, you should be on the winning side of this game, but what happens when the player does not have those statistics? You could then assume that he will not have as much chance of winning a game, and could fall behind in the other statistics, but this is not always the case. Let’s have a look at the stats of the same player, and compare them to another one:

Player Kills

In these stats, the player has received just as much damage and has received more kills than the above player. Yet, he is still behind this player. One of the main reasons for this is because the player above averages the best kill rates and the worst amount of deaths per game, thus he will be at a very high kill count and very low amount of deaths, so therefore, he will get first blood more often than the player below. Both players are performing very close together, which is one of the main factors when comparing stats. These stats, however, tell us that the player should be higher up in the rankings than the other player, since he is performing better than him. They also tell us that this player will not have the same amount of deaths per game as he was in the previous charts, because his ‘number of deaths’ per game is so much lower than the other player. This is good to know, as these are the only statistics you have to base a team around.

Now that we have compared the performance of two players, it’s worth seeing what changes if you alter the two players around a bit. Let’s take a look at the stats of a player in comparison to his own stats. You can see that both players are performing close to each other, but their stats vary greatly. The above player is the one performing better, as he has a higher number of kills and less deaths, which will give him an edge if they are fighting each other. The first player to deal with would be the one who is performing worse, because his number of deaths is much higher than the one who is beating him in these stats. However, when you look at the damage charts you can see that these players are performing the same, so perhaps the numbers we have shown so far do not tell the full story.

Player Deaths

The player above is getting hit a lot more by his own teammates, but since he deals less damage, it’s fair to say that he’s getting hit more than the one below. This graph shows you the amount of deaths a player is receiving from other players. However, there is another statistic that may tell you more about how that player is performing, and that is the % amount of deaths they have received.

Kills from Teammates

If you look at the one in red, he has received the most amount of kills per death, this means that he has received the most amount of kills from the players he has been killed by. This player would be very difficult to kill in team-based combat, but the one in green is a little less desirable as he has only been killed by the opponents and not received any kills from his teammates. This player is often the easiest target because of the amount of kills that he will be receiving, and you can see that he has received just over a quarter of his deaths from his teammates. This means that he will not be performing as well as the player in blue. If you are a team of all these players, you will be getting more kills from your opponents than you will getting from the players that you’ve killed.

You can see a common trend between the above charts, the higher the percentage is, the more the player is performing. This is a good indicator of who will be more successful. However, it would be very difficult to create a system that takes all the above factors into account. They all contribute to each other. If a player does not do well at anything, then he won’t be successful as a player. So, just because the statistics show that a player isn’t the best in each stat, it doesn’t mean that he will not be good at the game, especially with team based gameplay.

I hope this has shed some light on each individual part of the equation and has allowed you to form a better understanding of the entire performance. If you have any ideas for topics to be covered in these articles, or if you are good at graphing, feel free to comment.
