Instead  of staying on  the topic of the last video, I was told a few  things. I made the assumption from  the comments and actions that they all had sex with the same person,  all except the blond girl who  I decided was the narrator. The girl who  I thought was the narrator just seemed to me a very  sensitive individual. I would be ashamed for someone who  I didn't even know had done that. Then it came  out they were all just characters in a  movie. I was devastated. The whole  audience was stunned and didn't know what to do. So now  the group that brought us all to orgasm are nothing  more than actors.  I'd like to see a real person turn  me on in that fashion. I'm still scarred."

That's the reaction of a lot of us to  this film. You can't even get a real person to get real nude and have  sex with another person in front of you. Maybe this is what we wanted:  We want a movie that gives us a chance to see sex   with porn stars, we want  a movie that can act as a surrogate for us, we don't  want  the real person to do it for us. They've done that with  all of us. They're still doing it with us. What  happened to the guy in the video? He's     gone. How do you deal with that?

### **D.W. :**

"Well, yeah,   of course."

### **J.R. :**

"I know what happened. He's having a hard time in   his life and he doesn't need all of us coming   after him."

### **M.A. :**

"What is he doing?"

### **J.R. :**

"His life is being over- looked, all of us and the rest of     us. He's still the same guy. Even if he was doing  those things, I still      think that we made a mistake by watching him."

### **D.W. :**

"I mean, yeah, it was done by consent. What were we supposed to do?"

### **M.A. :**

"It's not like you were forced to be there."

### **D.W. :**

"We wanted to be there."

### **J.R. :**

"I didn't want to see him get hurt."

### **M.A. :**

"There is no way we could have seen this and not be changed by  it. So we can't say it wasn't a success or a failure. This  was something you should have thought of before. You should have  known that this could happen. But it happened and it happened to you."

### **J.R. :**

"I know I was affected by it. It shook me."

### **D.W. :**

"We have to make an   effort not to let it happen to us."

### **M.A. :**

"I would like us to look at what         happened, try to learn from it. How are we going to keep 

> this from happening again? We must stop the         attraction, control ourselves.  

The problem is, maybe  everything is going to be fine."

### **J.R. :**

"It's so strange when you have  something you       really like, it's like a friend, you're happy and then  everything      falls apart."

### **D.W. :**

"I do think, that         people have to be open, and         when you feel comfortable, you         should be open about it, not like an         orifice. I am just saying, this is about a porn act."

### **M.A. :**

"It should be a real experience, 

> it should be something, you know, you don't have      to fake it. You don't have to be a fan. For the most part,         we're talking about a situation where 

> there has to be common ground."

### **J.R. :**

"It's a bit ironic. Look at it that way, that we're all fucked up."

### **D.W. :**

"I would like the movie to go to some kind of 

> help place, maybe something like a home where kids who need to see      this, because maybe they've already seen it and they're         looking for something else."

### **M.A. :**

"I want you to do all you can to prevent the next group 

> from seeing this. You can help turn this thing into 

> something. This is going to get the attention of the           press. You can take this and let it lead you to something 

> else. We are not done yet. We are not done yet."

### **J.R. :**

"This is the story we should talk about."

### **D.W. :**

"The movie is not going to save us. This is like when I was in sixth grade and I was really into the    Beach Boys, so my friends wrote something bad about the  Beach Boys. I didn't want to hear about it. If it happened to me, the next thing that happened was that I would look at           the situation in a totally different way. I did not want to do that. I'd rather have no 

> story at all than have this movie. I'd like to see a whole bunch 

> of people like you and I sitting around in a room, 

> discussing sex. We'd be able to talk about this like we are right           now, talking about how screwed up this whole thing is. We don't 

> want to go back to a time when people didn't have sex. If we don't talk about this now, we'll never 

> get out of this mess. Let's figure it out. A lot of it was the feeling 

> of a stranger in our house, of what happened to the old video, of 

> how is it that something like this happens and all of a sudden, 

> after all of this, we're going to lose the whole thing?"

### **D.W. :**

"Yes. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. We are going to lose the whole thing, everybody. And we 

> don't want to do that."

### **M.A. :**

"I know that I have hurt you."

### **D.W. :**

"You're going to make us out to be stupid because you don't know what is happening. Well, if it's so stupid, why are you 

> doing it?"

### **M.A. :**

"Because we have to, you know. For some reason, for some reason we have to."

### **J.R. :**

"There has to be a common ground, and that common ground has to be the real one. The real one is when we 

> take care of each other in a way that creates a higher ground, the higher ground 

> that we all could possibly see."

### **D.W. :**

"And I guess that's what we're looking for, as adults."

### **M.A. :**

"We can't do that, but we can begin to help ourselves and we can begin to look at it all with a lot of common sense, and common-sense has nothing to do with sex. I can't tell you why, but when you're talking to someone and you're standing in front of them, when you're naked and you're having sex, and you're naked and you're having sex, you have to take responsibility for that. You cannot be passive about it. You're not being passive when you're looking into the eyes of someone who has sex with the whole world watching. Why should they think it is okay, to have sex like that. Are you saying they should do it anyway? That's the question you should be asking. If you can't ask yourself, how can you ask someone else?"

### **J.R. :**

"Well, I think we can ask how you feel about sex and 

> everyone agrees with that one. But the question we really want to ask ourselves is how can you get to the point where you can help. 

You might have to help yourself first."

### **D.W. :**

"And when you do ask the question, and I think that
