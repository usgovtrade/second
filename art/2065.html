So here's my latest find: The Swag Man. What's that you say? You're never heard of The Swag Man? Well, you can thank the hip-hop kids for that. He's a character that has been in several rap songs that are very popular over the years. That's a rap term for someone who always has the hottest swag. I always liked The Swag Man character because he'd always want you to have the hottest swag too. So I decided to make my own version of The Swag Man, and he needs a name, so I asked my family and they suggested Swag Kid. It's fun and fits perfectly for a children's book. Thanks family!

I drew this book myself, and it's just a little kid size, 5"x 7" book.

But you have to go back to that rap songs because that was the only reference I had for Swag Man. And believe me, I tried to look for images online that would give me a good idea about what I could draw. So I could use an image for this book. This was my inspiration to write a book about Swag Man:

But the main reason I started this book was because I got some hip-hop kids to sign it for me when they visited the Children's Book Guild last month. They signed the book because they liked my style of drawing and I liked that they chose my book because they like the comic version of the Swag Man. But my book was small and so they signed it in black magic marker, which they use. They all loved the book though and I was so happy about the attention that I got from them. So that's how Swag Kid got his swag back!

Here's a description of the book:

Swag Kid is back with the second book in this wonderful series. It's called Swag Kid: The Stuff Of Legends. After Swag Kid got his Swag back, he thought he'd do the same for his friend, the Jungle Girl. But she had too much stuff and then she would have trouble with juggling. Now Swag Kid will give her his Swag so she can find the perfect Swag and start winning the games and adventures.

The series is about Swag Kid who uses his Swag powers to get stuff for his friend in order to help her win some super-swag adventures, like playing golf with a dinosaur. So he tries a little magic and gets a magic wand and from that magical wand we find out that the power of the magic wand is magic itself. So there you go, Swag Kid, getting Swag with a magic wand! The drawings in this book are on super-thick paper so that you can hold the book in your hand and feel the weight. That's right, this is a book you'll feel all over! Enjoy!
