A:

I recommend using OpenCV 3 which is actively being developed. It's completely free and the official python interface is based on opencv4olib. I have used it successfully for stereo vision.
Stereo Vision with OpenCV 3 using Python

A:

I'll recommend OpenCV with Python if you are looking to use with Python (as you stated). OpenCV has Python bindings as well.
If you are going to get really fancy, there is always Intel's IPP, but if you're looking to do this as a hobby, I would not recommend it. I have found OpenCV to be a very solid tool for image processing in Python.

A:

For 3d reconstruction based on a single picture, you can use 3D-vision-toolkit (from my previous answer):
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E6VwVG7SJI
There are plenty of other 3D reconstruction tools.

A:

The OpenCV (not OpenCV3) version is not actively developed or maintained (see https://sourceforge.net/p/opencv/tickets/9/).
The only viable way to get the latest OpenCV source code as a Python module is to manually build the project from the sources (See http://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_visual_studio_Opencv_build_from_source/windows_visual_studio_Opencv_build_from_source.html). 
But you can do it more easily with CMake:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
sudo make install

When the build is complete, you can find the modules you need under opencv/python/python-package:
cd opencv/python/python-package
sudo python setup.py install

This approach works for the latest OpenCV version (4.2.0). With CMake, you can also build OpenCV by simply typing make in the main opencv/ folder.
You can find additional instructions in this tutorial:
http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/11/03/opencv-using-python-as-a-module-on-mac-and-linux/

Please see:

Is OpenCV-Python the Python version used in opencv/samples/python2?
http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_console/py_console.html#console-program

You will need Python 2.7.9 or newer.

Note that I suggest the older OpenCV (maybe OpenCV 2.4).
OpenCV3 is quite different and not really ready for production use.

http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/19/opencv-using-python-as-a-module-on-mac-and-linux/

(The article is dated 2015. But the information on using OpenCV 3 is still relevant.)

I suggest to look at your old versions of OpenCV because there have been some changes on the syntax of OpenCV with Python from OpenCV2 to OpenCV3.

You can also try this 3D reconstruction code, but this one is for Python2.

https://github.com/sebastianraschka/opencv-viz/

It only has a "minimal" 3D viewer.
The code includes the following lines:
>>> from numpy import *
>>> from numpy.linalg import *

You should use Python3 because it supports a more complete Python standard library.
In Python3, the code for this 3D visualization is here.

Another option is to use the free version of VTK:
https://github.com/Kitware/VTK

(VTK/VTKpro only support Python2 and Python3 versions, so the code for VTK/VTKpro will not be available for Python2.7)
(You need to use the Python interface of VTK.)

OpenCV4.2 has recently added some support for C++11 and Python 3. The next release (probably 4.3.0) will be using C++11 syntax for OpenCV.
But there is no plan to have Python 3 support in this release</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:01
