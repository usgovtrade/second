"Gap is a relatively easy problem to solve. Most of our data are 
  stored in our database, so the real challenge is keeping the 
  data synchronized on our servers with our laptops, tablets, cell 
  phones, and PDA's." 

The goal is to allow users on-the-go access to their critical data 
stored remotely. 

"Gap is about making sense of your life" 

This is achieved through an application to organize all of your personal information,
  your personal data, your personal identity, your personal network. 
  This is about organizing the information and the life.
