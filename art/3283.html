"They destroyed your family." "It was a fucking miscarriage of justice!" "And I'm sorry for you, and I'm sorry for your son, but I did what I had to do." "You know, Lenny..." "I was going to do this alone." "I was going to take him and just disappear to Russia, but you know your son." "He's like a cockroach or something." "And I can't leave the country and..." "And so, if I'm responsible for getting him back," "I'm happy." "I'm not asking for your permission." "I'll send him back legally, and they'll be able to see him in the U.S." "You're asking for my trust, and I'll give it to you." "How can I trust you?" "I don't understand." "You can trust me with your son's life." "He's going to go back to the States and be a little American boy." "Yeah." "Will you please stay for a little bit?" "You can sleep on the bed."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:54
