Some devices may receive multiple radio frequency (RF) signals. These multiple RF signals may be from a single source (e.g., a single device), multiple sources, or may be from multiple sources at the same time.
Some devices may employ multiple antennae (e.g., a diversity antenna or multiple antennae) to receive RF signals. In this regard, two or more antennae may be combined to improve reception of an RF signal.
Similarly, transmission of RF signals may involve employing multiple antennae to transmit the RF signal. In this regard, multiple antennae may be employed to transmit an RF signal, where at least one antenna may be active or transmitting, and at least one other antenna may be used to receive the RF signal.
It is noted that for some wireless communications standards, a device may employ multiple antennas on a single chip. For example, the third generation (3G) cellular communication standard commonly known as “cdma2000,” employs this form of multiple antennas.
Diversity antennae may be based on different frequencies or antennas. For example, diversity antennae may be frequency diversity antennae and/or polarization diversity antennae. Diversity antennae may enhance signal quality when a device is receiving an RF signal or when a device is transmitting an RF signal.
Some wireless communication devices may employ multiple types of antennae. For example, a device may have diversity antennae, multiple RF (e.g., cellular) antennae, multiple Bluetooth antennae, and multiple WLAN (e.g., WIFI) antennae.
Diversity antennae may include two or more antennae of the same type. For example, two diversity antennae of the same type may be two diversity antennae of a different frequencies or diversity antennae of the same frequencies. For example, diversity antennae of the same type may be frequency diversity antennae and/or polarization diversity antennae.
Diversity antennae may have different parameters, such as the orientation of the antenna(s), spacing between the antenna(s), polarization of the antenna(s), signal phase, etc. Antenna parameters may be controlled to improve the antenna's performance. Some examples of diversity antennae parameters may include receive diversity, transmit diversity, power control, data rate, modulation, frequency, frequency channel, and/or polarizations.
Diversity antennae can be used with a device's antenna system. In this regard, a device's antenna system may comprise a diversity antenna and one or more other antennae of the device.
Antenna system diversity can be based on frequency, polarization, phase, proximity, and/or direction. Frequency diversity can be based on one or more frequency channels, as well as use of different frequency bands. Polarization diversity can include transmission and/or reception based on different polarizations. Phase diversity can include the use of different transmission and/or reception antenna phase to improve the quality of the received signal. Proximity diversity can be based on using multiple antennae that are located near each other. Proximity diversity can be based on antennae that are close enough so that at least part of one antennae is within the near field (e.g., within approximately 10 times the wavelength of the RF signal) of at least part of another antennae. Diversity antennae can be directional diversity antennae (i.e., non-collocated antennae) that transmit or receive in different directions. Directional antennae can be phased antennae (i.e., a type of non-collocated antennae). In addition, diversity antennae can be spatial diversity antennae (i.e., collocated antennae), such as multiple antennae in one location (i.e., located on the same chip).
Some wireless communication devices may employ a chip with multiple antennae to simultaneously transmit and receive RF signals. In some devices, one or more antennae may be located in the same package or device with other antennae (e.g., located on the same chip).
Generally, a device's antenna system can be optimized for a particular wireless standard or protocol. In some devices, for example, a chip with multiple antennae can be optimized for the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) standard. In other devices, for example, a chip with multiple antennae can be optimized for the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) standard. As a result, the performance of the antenna system for a given wireless standard or protocol may be optimized.
In some devices, for example, a device may be able to detect or monitor a plurality of wireless standards or protocols. This is done by examining the frequency bands used by the wireless standards or protocols. Thus, in one device, a plurality of antennae can be operated to simultaneously receive signals in the frequency bands of two or more wireless standards or protocols. Alternatively, one antennae can be used to transmit and receive signals of different wireless standards or protocols. In some devices, a plurality of antennae may be connected to a single processor of the device. In other devices, a plurality of antennae can be distributed among a number of processors of the device.
In some devices, one or more antennae may be shared by different wireless standards or protocols. In such devices, the device may use any of the antennae for communication of any of the wireless standards or protocols.
Some devices may employ multiple receive paths for wireless communication. For example, the device may have multiple receive paths (e.g., a direct path and a diversity path). Some examples of receive paths may be: a diversity path and a direct path; diversity paths that are combined (e.g., added); and diversity paths that are split (e.g., a direct path that is created).
A diversity path can be employed to provide, for example, increased reliability, such as when an antennae may be blocked or shadowed. This is in contrast to a direct path, which may be used to provide, for example, higher bandwidth, greater received signal strength, etc.
A receive path of a device may employ a receive diversity antennae system, such as a diversity antennae system, to receive signals (e.g., transmissions, etc.). Receive diversity antennae may improve the quality of signals received by a device, by suppressing and/or eliminating a bias in the phase and/or amplitude of the received signal due to noise and/or other signal paths (e.g., other antennae of the device).
Some conventional receive diversity antennae systems employ a diversity antenna and a direct path antenna. In these systems, the direct path antenna may be disabled when the diversity antenna is selected.
In some systems, the diversity antenna may be disabled in software when a direct path antenna is selected. In some other systems, the diversity antenna may be disabled in hardware. In some devices, disabling the diversity antenna may involve one or more RF switches.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:50
