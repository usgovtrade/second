The issue:
I currently have a basic WordPress site up and running. In addition to general wordpress related stuff I’ve used WordPress Widgets to create four separate pages in the sidebar. Each of the widget areas are pulling from the same table in the database which is pulling out content from a database, I don’t know whether this is bad practice but I’m not sure of the implications.

The Issue
I am now having problems with images on my blog. I’ve tried uploading images but WordPress keeps telling me the URL is not set up correctly. I have changed the URL for the images by going into dashboard>settings>permalinks and also by going to settings>permalinks and changing there. I also changed the name of image to <code>images/myimage.png</code> (for some reason this needs to be set using code)

The Issue:
To access your blog, you will need to either know the IP address of your machine or provide a list of DNS names for the domain(s) you are using to access this site.

In any case, please note that IP addresses are subject to change at any time.

If your web host’s domain name was not preconfigured in the configuration of your blogging software, please fill in the DNS information below:

If your web host has provided a blank line at the bottom of your web page, please insert this information.

We strongly recommend that you choose the primary nameserver to point to your own domain name. Only put DNS information in there you are willing to stay with for the lifetime of your web site.

If the nameserver set in the configuration of your blogging software does not point to any of these three name servers, then you should set up one or more of the above nameservers. If you are using no nameservers or using other nameservers for your web site, then add information in your comment to help others help you, and we will change the above configuration back to “no nameservers”.

Your web host may also have given you one or more of the following information:

IP address or
DNS names which point to one or more of the following (in the event that the hosting company has not set up a domain name for you in the system):

If you used the above addresses or names, please remove them from the comment area.

Your web host may also have provided you with an email address that can be used to contact them.

In addition to the above, if you are using a web host provided email address, we recommend that you use their servers to register your domain name. Please provide us with information about any of these addresses or names in the form below:

Your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number and we will help you find the best domain name for you. Please remember that if you do not have your own domain name, you must include the name of your web site with your email address.

I have looked at my current posts and it seems that the post I have in question is only 5 lines long.

There are no special characters in it and I tried copying the html code so I could copy it here but I got the same error message: "The posting you attempted to upload could not be handled because of an invalid character in the post."

I deleted the last 6 lines and tried again but the same error message came up.

So I deleted it and added a new post but there is still the same error message when I try to upload.

I don't get the point of the whole thing.

What did I do wrong? And how do I fix it? (I'm not very techy by nature and don't know much about html etc. I just started using html and css and don't understand much of it)

I guess my questions is: Is there any way of retrieving the html code that I deleted from my posts?

I know the "posts" are in the database, but does this include the formatting? and if so how do I delete this so I can upload the post again without the formatting?

You need to figure out how you got the error message. We try to give users as much information about the nature of errors as we can. If you give us the error message and a sample post and we can figure out what happened. If you still do not understand the problem, we have asked you to include all the data needed to resolve the problem. If you do not understand that, then you really are not a very good user or webmaster. We are sorry.

I just wanted to say thank you for taking my blog under your wing and teaching me as much as you have, I feel like I am not learning a craft but more something I can enjoy and share with my family. So thanks for everything.

I think you're the only one trying to help me. Everything you say is so difficult to understand. I just have two questions:

1. How do I delete these posts that have code or bad html/spellings in them?

2. Will I be able to re-upload the posts in my web editor?

It seems like deleting them in my web editor could be done easily, but so far I can't find any information on how to do it there.

I don't know about the html or if I can fix it. I have a lot of posts here and I don't know the difference between good post and bad post. I can try deleting them but I have no idea how to do that in html editor. If I am to delete them, then how do I go about it?

I need someone to explain all this for me and what I'm doing wrong.

I am happy to be getting help from you here, but I don't know how to make it work.

This is the form where you need to enter HTML tags and coding. This is why you need to have something that you are wanting to repair. Otherwise you cannot see it. Now, the first one, look at where you inserted the line breaks. They would not be in the middle of words like we have here, but have spaces between the words like this:

In your next post on this topic, please enter only as much HTML code as you need to repair. In this case, you only need to use <font> and not everything in your post that is not necessary.

Can someone please tell me how to post code in this text area. I want to insert my code. I am getting a message back that says: "Your post contains a bad or missing description." How do I insert HTML code? Please advise.

I’m currently working on learning web publishing and have a post I’m trying to add that has html code and it's not adding it to the post, it has the code on the side of the post with a blank space before the first paragraph like this:

Now if I paste this into one of my posts it works fine, but if I copy this into my editor it doesn’t work. How do I correct this? Do I have to remove the space before the <p> tag? I need help and I’m trying to understand everything in order to become the best I can be.

First of all, please fix the name and make sure that your name does not interfere with the spelling of my name. I will fix it if it does but I would prefer that you fix it before I do. This way we do not get more confusion.

You can delete text, that is very simple. You need to use tags for anything more complicated and you have to use what is called inline coding for things like <font> <strong> and <em>. You will want to type one or two tags or word for each word that you want to add to the page.

If you have any questions, please ask. I am here to help you. Do you know that?
