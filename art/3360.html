A simple one-handed hold of this cord with either a backhand or forehand grip will allow you to hold a bottle of wine, a glass, a pitcher, or any other item as long as the length of rope is sufficiently long enough.

Tightly hold the middle of the loop with your right hand, using your thumb and index finger to give it a secure grip. Then, bring your left hand over your right and pull the cord up in a fluid motion with your fingers. This will create a simple slip knot that creates a tight loop around your hand, allowing you to hold whatever you choose securely.

Take your free hand and gently pull on the free end, and you’ll feel a slight resistance as it stretches. Keeping your grip on the cord, release your finger on the loop and stretch out the free end for 1 – 2 inches (2.5 – 5 centimeters) to create a comfortable length that will not cause any pressure points as you’ll be holding this for extended periods of time.

You can use a small rubber band to secure the loop in place. Gather up a few inches (or centimeters) in the middle of the loop, and wrap the end around the base of your thumb, and back around again before pulling tight. Secure the rubber band by tying a simple overhand knot in the loop with your free hand.

This will keep the loop snug without any unnecessary movement of the rubber band. Repeat this on the other side, to make sure there are no snags, and you’re all set to go.

If you have a hard time keeping a tight grip on the cord while the cord is in use, you can use a rubber band or a cord binder to secure the end of the cord. Either way, you will be able to use the rubber band or cord binder as a handle to carry items around with you.

Another option is to tie a simple overhand knot to create a slipknot, or create a chain of these knots and loop it around your wrist or arm. If you choose to make a chain of them, you will want to repeat this process twice or more to make it stronger.

This simple cord technique is ideal for holding bottles of wine, glasses, pots, pans, etc., and will save you a lot of frustration, and time, during any social gatherings or camping trips.

I originally learned how to do this one-handed bottle holder in basic military training, but the technique has been used by me and my family for many years.

This is a great tip that you can use even if you do not drink wine. I have some hardback albums that I put away on a shelf in my office. My wife wants to put all of her crochet supplies on my “hook” shelf and I can’t grab anything without my hands going on all the shelf’s little bumps. I can pick up the books but not the small crochet supplies. – John K.

I learned this from a friend in our local gym. It’s pretty helpful for bottle or umbrella or even a beer bong! – Dan B.

The best way to wrap that rubber band is the figure eight method! – Matthew B.

I was wondering if you had any other tips on this, such as putting a knot every inch or so to hold it tight on a long piece of rope or what not – Sam R.

What is a cord binder? – A cord binder is a very useful little tool that lets you create a cord in one hand, with no rubber band or binder required. Get the latest cord binder here.
