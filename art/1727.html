that's realer than most startups. It's
also a great way to get to know the company, since you'll get to witness the
whole process, from idea to launch. They get a chance to do a lot of
customer outreach and educate others about their idea, and you get an inside
look at a real business and not just another startup. (This is what an
entrepreneur thinks about an incubator: http://www.ycombinator.com/faq.html
)

So if you want to start a business, but don't want to quit your day job yet
and you want to do something with a team of professionals that has a real
business and you like the idea of being involved in a company that's real,
then do it, but be warned: It's like a long term relationship with a bunch of
drama sometimes. Just like with any relationship, don't do it unless you're
sure you can handle it.

If you want to start a startup but don't know where to start or have the guts
to do it on your own, then start attending some meetups. If you're really
motivated, then see if there's a group in your area that you can join. You can
look at different meetup groups' sites (like TechStars in NYC) or read Meetup
(http://www.meetup.com/), then go for it! There's a long list of startup
groups on www.techcofounder.com as well.

Then try and get more out of the meetup than just networking. Try and meet
some local entrepreneurs and start talking to them about your problem or idea,
or if you know enough about startups, and want to start a business by yourself,
try and convince some of the established people to start a company with you.
This is what the early stages of a startup is, and it's what the meetups are
for.

Good luck and don't let the noise get to you, if you're smart, you can still
run a startup and not give up your day job.

In our case we found a really great group of people and now we have a business
that's making money. They even took care of taxes and set it all up for us so
we could be in business the day we got the keys to the office. So we don't pay
rent, we pay our mortgage. We are all having a blast and building something
real.

And we're not even in the same city as they are. That was the key, to be in a
place where we were close enough for them to have access to us. But we're too
far away for them to make regular trips to see us. Which is good because
everyone comes with so much experience. The CEO has been doing this for 15
years; she knows it all.

It's like when you get a dog. The dog is your life's partner, the one you
travel with, the one you go to see on weekends, but they are not always there.

They're all in one place?

No they aren't. At best they're in maybe one in 5 of the cities in this list
(my own city doesn't have one).

I can’t see any mention in the article of the most fundamental of tasks,
getting business done?

Also, for all you hackers out there, take note of the fact that the list
includes several small towns in the uk with a population of no more than
10,000 people.

_The best business ideas should be simple and cheap._

The best business ideas and processes are simple and cheap. But there is a
huge issue with this sentence and it is not the author’s fault, is it? A more
accurate way of saying this is:

 _The best business ideas and processes are simple and cheap. However, there
is a huge issue with this statement, and the main reason I wrote this article.
That issue is this: They are not easy to find._

zkinion
Yeah, sounds like something out of a movie or an idealistic comic book.

I think the issue is that most of us are just too afraid to go through with
it. It's not that tough, it just takes some discipline and a lot of effort.
Some of us are just lazy and want something without all that hard work.

That's the problem with a lot of people; they either want instant gratification
or instant results. We're just not there yet in the startup scene for that to
happen, and it will likely never be the case.

Startup incubators are full of ideas but few ever succeed. One of the biggest
problem with them is the failure of getting things off the ground, all the
people working on it are not necessarily working on the thing that will get
them off the ground. Also, if you have funding, the incubator will take the
majority of it. The idea is great but if you are trying to get a product or
idea to market you can't get anything off the ground from it unless you are a
very rich guy.

Another issue with incubators is that it is almost impossible to take your
idea with you when you leave. One guy that I know quit his job and went down
to San Jose, CA from Canada and got a job with a startup incubator. He took
this startup as his own business and that basically became his life for over a
year until it was clear that the startup wasn't doing well. There is always a
ton of stress with this and you are basically always on call.

The other problem with incubators is that they keep ideas so secret, that you
usually can't tell who owns the idea and they often don't own the source code
or do the final product in house, all the work is outsourced. If you want to
get things started it is really hard without being backed by a major company,
you have to be able to get people on board before even having code written. If
your going to give equity, you have to be prepared for people to run off with
the idea.

The other big thing is that once you leave the incubator the startup is over
and all the work you did is now someone else's burden to deal with.

There are many ways to do it but at this stage most incubators just screw you
over and don't want to give you anything. I see why they want to keep their
name secret from potential competitors, the startup just don't have a chance,
because of all the above reasons, people just don't want to go through all
that stuff.

I find a lot of people who start start-ups make the same mistakes. It's one
good move after another.

The best move is being a good student. I think it's really hard to get a good
startup idea.

mynameishere
The idea isn't the hard part. The hard part is actually selling it, and if
you're not prepared for the fact that your "best startup idea" is not actually
the best, then you're going to end up getting screwed.

Where's the startup scene for hardware, especially electronic hardware?

My startup ideas generally revolve around digital systems and hardware to run
them on (in short: embedded software/hardware). So I'm curious if</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:24
