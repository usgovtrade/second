“Every religion which exists today is the result of this eternal fight, whether in the realm of spirit or in that of matter.” (H.P. Blavatsky)

The human race has a long history of religious traditions, and each has a core belief that gives purpose to each individual. Many religions are concerned with the afterlife. Whether or not this afterlife exists is immaterial; it can be imagined to be in heaven or hell, in a realm where life and death continue, or, simply in the “after-ness” of life as a part of an ever-enduring cycle. It is these fundamental beliefs that often dictate the behavior and even the character of the person.

The question of what happens when we die has always been a source of great curiosity. A common explanation has been the idea that we are reincarnated into a new life, where karma takes over and that dictates the conditions of our new life. However, the more I have studied these ideas, it is clear that this is only a theory. The reason is simple. Our karma is not determined by the life we led the last time we were on Earth, but by the beliefs we held during that life. And because we come back with these beliefs, these karmas, the idea of reincarnation seems to be absurd.

That said, karma still takes place. Why? Because Karma is karma! Karma is not only about our individual actions, but is also a condition of the present moment based on the beliefs that we hold. Karma is a “universal cause” that binds together individual causes and effects that lead to actions and reactions. Everything in the present moment has a connection to everything in past and future. Actions in the present moment lead to further actions. This idea of Cause and Effect has a long tradition in Hindu philosophy. It is even found in Judaism, where the concept of “Causality of Effect” is mentioned in a number of verses. For example, when Moses saw the burning bush, he became angry and threw the Stone Water Table into the fire. “I have seen a God that will not let you off the hook. He will not allow your children to turn from him to other gods.” (Exodus chapter 3 verse 20)

The concept of this in Buddhism is called “Pratītyasamutpāda” which is translated as “Causality of Condition” but in reality is more accurate as “Causality of Effect.” In Hinduism, Karma is the driving force behind the cycle of birth and death; for example, it explains why some people die of cancer and why others live a normal life. It explains why two twins, born with the exact same characteristics, often react differently to life and the world around them. In Vedanta, this was called “Karma.” If all people in the world reacted to everything in the same way, it would mean there is no free will. People would be bound by their present circumstances and what they are born into, rather than making free decisions based on their true nature. One of the earliest references to this in the Rig Veda is called: “I see the Karmic laws at work in a very simple way; as the spider swings and spans itself out, and is then trapped.” (Rig Veda, chapter 31, hymn 12) This concept is actually about cause and effect rather than karma, but karma is used to describe a kind of destiny or the belief that we have free will.

This theory is a central doctrine of Buddhism, and is taught in great detail in the Theravada tradition, where all actions cause future events. For example, “If a person takes a drug, he will receive an illness.” This is a very simplistic way of explaining things, and a great many Buddhist schools reject it, arguing that our thoughts are the cause of all our future actions, not external things like drugs or illnesses. In modern Buddhism we often refer to this belief as “Reincarnation.” Although the concept of reincarnation is often rejected, it is still taught in many Buddhist traditions around the world. The idea of karma is still taught in many schools of Buddhism, despite the fact that we reject the concept of reincarnation. The reason for this is because of the importance of karma in their understanding of how things work in this world. Karmic law determines who we are and how we react to situations, thus it is important in their teachings.

This teaching is called “Saṃsāra,” which is a Sanskrit word meaning “wandering” or “errant.” This means that we are in a perpetual state of wandering through samsara, forever creating karma. The Buddha clearly states this in several sutras, like the Lankavatara Sutra: “All the Buddhas of all times, the past, the present, and the future, have taught samsara and nirvana.” He also taught that samsara was the result of being bound by three natures: desire, aversion, and ignorance. These are the three ways that all beings react to their experiences in this world, and all are driven by a fundamental fear of life. In Buddhism the root cause is attachment, and no one can escape it. Therefore, whether we’re reborn or not is decided in this moment of life.

Buddhist monks often refer to Buddha’s past lives to try to give meaning to life. It is important to note that this idea is not related to the concepts of reincarnation. It is a mythical belief that Buddha came from some place called “Ocean of Milk” in the center of the world. In one of his past lives as the Prince Sudasa, he was forced to descend into a dark cave, where he was given four bowls of rice, each containing the name of one of the four great Buddhas: Dīpaṃkara, Dharmakara, Vipassī, and Sammābhogakāra. The last bowl contained a mixture of grains called the “essence of purity,” which would make this place a heavenly garden. He was told to stay and protect the place in this manner, and he would continue to do so until the end of his life. The Buddha was reborn in different places in that ocean, until he ended up in the forest near the “worldly village of Kusinara” where he was born. There he continued to follow the principles he was taught to the end of his life. Even though this story is well known among Buddhists, it has no connection with their religion. It is simply a story about a man who was inspired to become a Buddhist in one lifetime. It is a mythical story to teach people about the Buddha’s spiritual and moral excellence.

The same belief is held by some Christian mystics, who believe that the “Son of Man” or “Son of God” was Jesus was reborn in different times. At one time, we might call him Jesus of Nazareth. At another time, he may be called “Jesus of Baghdad.” Or “Jesus of Samaria.” In this way, followers of Christianity can continue to believe in their personal relationship with Christ and his teachings, and not need to see a break with their ancestors or their culture. The same is true of Sufi mystics. They have their own stories about the great mystics of the past, which also explain the mystical experiences of great figures such as Rumi and Kabir.

All of these stories are simply attempts to explain that, in essence, no one can escape the karma they create. This is one of the fundamental teachings of all great religions. Some choose to accept this as a core belief and carry this thought through their actions. Others believe that this is the ultimate truth and the goal of their spiritual practice is simply to experience it. These beliefs are not meant to tell us how life works in this world, but are merely the spiritual equivalent of taking a scientific, physical, and analytical approach to all aspects of life. They are not meant to be dogmatic or to lead us to any conclusion. The idea is to use this belief to guide our actions in the present.

Because this teaching does not come from any religious group, its understanding does not need to be defined by any single belief. If you think a certain way is the true way, then it is the true way. As long as you can explain the idea of free will and your actions as an effect of what you believe, rather than as a cause of it, you can accept any spiritual teaching.

In this way, Karma is also what makes our traditions very important. Each of us is in a unique position in our family tree and with each of these positions we carry a different karmic weight. When two people meet, these two individuals have a history that determines their current situation. These positions can be positive or negative, depending on our own actions, and our reaction to the behavior of others. If you believe that</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:35
