A new venue has opened that features Cachaça (pronounced 'kah- _sa_ '), the Brazilian sugarcane-derived spirit with which some claim a direct line can be traced back to Homer in ancient Greece. More likely, the idea for Cachaça emerged in Brazil as a result of similar sugar cane products from elsewhere in the Caribbean, which, in the 18th century, made their way north to the city.

### DANCE WITH THE RACHAIS WOMEN

Rachais _(rachâe)_ is a dance that was popularized by _sertanejo_ (southeasterner) music and dance legend Silvio. It combines elements of samba, forró, axé and _chorinho_ and is characterized by a driving rhythm. Women take the lead, which makes for an equal balance of male and female dancers, something you don't see that often.

6Drinking & Nightlife

The weekend-long _festas_ (street festivals) in Lapa are a heady mix of people and alcohol, with an eclectic mix of live bands playing everything from samba to forró to rock, and locals dancing away the day in the streets. The festivities start on Friday around 9pm, reach a fever pitch around midnight and can spill over on to the following days.
