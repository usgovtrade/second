This course is meant to provide guidance to advisers in understanding how life-insurance policies can be transferred. A life-insurance policy is transferred if it changes ownership and this new owner is also its new owner. It does not matter whether the new owner is an individual or an institution.

All policies that can be transferred must have a transfer value. This value, which is typically known as the surrender value, allows you to transfer the policy to another owner without paying for it in cash. It is important to understand the risks involved in transferring a life-insurance policy.

As part of this course, you will learn the different ways to transfer life-insurance policies, including cash surrender and non-cash surrender value. You will also understand the various types of death claims and what your options are to transfer a policy.

The content that will be covered include:

What is a transfer?

Reasons for transfers.

Cash surrender value.

Non-cash surrender value.

Death claim.

Non-assignment of rights.

Understanding the different types of transfer.

This course is suitable for advisers who are required to advise clients on the legal aspects of life-insurance transfers, and for advisers who assist clients with transferring life-insurance policies.

Prerequisite(s) Knowledge of life-insurance products, such as permanent and whole-of-life.

About Us

Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough offering some kind words for his successor, CIO Dugan. Keith joined Hedgeye in 2007 after a distinguished career in both the hedge fund and investment management industry. He is one of the founding members of the World Gold Council, member of the US Gold Council, and serves as Vice President of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee.

I was honored when Dugan agreed to take the reins of the organization in August 2016. Our firm is comprised of both new and experienced investment professionals. In addition, Hedgeye strives to be a leader in training and professional development for individuals on the front lines of the business. As the second largest company in our sector, Hedgeye will continue to grow in 2016 and beyond, and Dugan is a big part of why we will be successful. Keith, you were an early hire in the hedge fund industry and, quite frankly, I don’t think you ever saw a hedge fund where you thought it was necessary to take a step back from managing positions and think about the bigger picture, but you did. Thank you for all that you did and for being one of the best investors in our industry.
