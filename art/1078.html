Before S. E. Hinton went on to create
The Outsiders, the beloved classic about a girl and her brother struggling with issues of loyalty, she wrote this coming-of-age story about two teenage boys growing up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. While The Outsiders has lost none of its power to shock and move readers, this updated edition is also full of new insights and information.

Publisher's Summary

When a woman finds an ancient artifact and uses it to heal the sick, it doesn’t take long before people begin to wonder if there is more to her ability than just simple skill. And when a boy has a horrible accident and grows up to be a horrible man, the woman is forced to confront her past in a way she never thought possible.

I just started this series, and this book was great! So much more plot than just the usual "ghost" or "horror story" tale. I loved the twist on the story and the characters. It was wonderful and well done. I am definitely looking forward to the next book! Thank you for providing such a great story to listen to!

Narrator, character voices, etc...

4 Stars: Good story, great story. However, the narrator is not able to read all the characters in the story. So, some of the voices don't match the actual character. It takes a little while for one to get used to the character. As a result, some of the story lines don't really work out well. For instance, in one of the scenes, the young adult narrator voice sounded too old for the character, so it took a bit to understand what was going on in the scene. Overall, a good story but be prepared for some characters not being portrayed well.

Outsiders

I loved these books, and can't believe it has been 25 years since they were first published. The story of a young teenaged girl who has had everything she had, and then lost it all to a tragic accident is so timely in today's world. While reading this in my own teenage years (the book was on the list of recommended books I could read before my 14th birthday), I thought "this</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:25
