<ogra> i need to be there physically for that
<ogra> so i cant come to UDS at all
<plars> it's certainly an interesting conundrum
<ogra> hmm, actually not a problem
<mterry> slangasek, do you know the kernel config option that turns on kprobes?  I seem to not have that, but some of our kernel patches disable CONFIG_KPROBES=y on !ARM
<slangasek> mterry: not off-hand; do you know why you need it turned on?
<mterry> slangasek, the whole point of kprobes is for performance profiling, right?
<slangasek> mterry: yes
<slangasek> mterry: "performance profiling" :)
<mterry> slangasek, OK.  :)  But yeah, I need kprobes turned on, even if we don't turn it on for other arches.  What I mean is, I want to know if this config option is somehow in our config set, or not set at all (and I'm missing it)
<slangasek> if you want to use kprobes for performance profiling, you generally have to enable the kprobes kconfig option
<mterry> slangasek, oh really?  That's fine then, then
<mterry> I will do that
<mterry> but there is a conditional in our kernel package so you can turn it off for architectures that don't support it
<mterry> (it uses that config option)
<slangasek> mterry: yes, please set up the kprobes config option regardless - it's only a performance optimization if you're actually going to use it :)
<slangasek> otherwise it's pointless
<mterry> slangasek, right, of course.  I will do so.  Thanks
<slangasek> if you're not actually going to use it, having it turned off in the kernel package means you won't get the performance optimization
<slangasek> but it should be present for boot time profiling
<mterry> slangasek, OK, k
<ogra> sigh, why cant i get my second NIC on my laptop to work on my second VM ... *sigh*
<ev> cjwatson: I guess you didn't see I got bug #746275? :)
<ubottu> Launchpad bug 746275 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Natty) "Can't access the web during install with ubiquity" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/746275
<ev> do you have any thoughts on it?
<ogra> slangasek, is the bootchart stuff supposed to work with the new kernel ?
<ogra> slangasek, i have a system here that doesnt finish booting, it ends up at a black screen
<ogra> slangasek, is there a special kernel needed to make that work ?
<cjwatson> ev: could you attach /var/log/syslog and /var/log/installer/debug?
<slangasek> ogra: it's working fine here, but there's no reason it shouldn't work with the oneiric kernels - please file a bug
<ogra> slangasek, i'm fine with reporting the issue, i just wanted to know if its because i use lucid kernels on lucid :)
<slangasek> ogra: it'll be kernel, sure
<cjwatson> ogra: nope, I just updated it to latest upstream
<cjwatson> (from 2.6.37)
<ev> cjwatson: sure thing
<ogra> ogra, lucid ? 
<ogra> !
<ogra> i'm running maverick
<ogra> thats why i am in an IRC channel with lts in the name ;)
<cjwatson> well, yes, I did say "lucid" earlier, but yes I mean the hardware
<ogra> ah, ok
<ogra> well, it also is possible that my nfs shares are to blame, i can see the luks prompt and all in my kern.log but i cant read the content
<ogra> so there might be some issue there ...
<cjwatson> /dev/pts is mounted?
<ogra> it is
<cjwatson> (that is indeed a kernel bug but the kernel can't do anything about it)
<ogra> yeah, its a weird issue indeed 
<ogra> bah
<cjwatson> ah, bah, you have the old nfs mount code ...
<ogra> right
<cjwatson> ok, I'll fix that soon
<ogra> in maverick
<ogra> so i get the whole system in front of me i'll poke around and see what i can find
<ogra> no hurry ... its just a bit annyoing that everythimg seems to get stuck
<ogra> *everything
<cjwatson> do you know what the kernel command line was?
<ogra> no, though i see the luks stuff in there
<ogra> i'll try to find something similar on a running system
<ogra> hmm, i see the UUID twice, is that normal ? 
<cjwatson> I doubt it
<ogra> seems all fie systems use different values
<cjwatson> could you put /var/log/installer/debug on paste.u.c or something?
<ogra> gah, it doesnt show anything without the extra UUID being on there
<cjwatson> what doesn't?
<ogra> the prompt that asks to type something
<cjwatson> it's supposed to be hidden but I can turn it off in the UI if you like
<ogra> no, its just the prompt of the luks-encrypted partition
<ogra> i mean that one
<ogra> *the* one
<ogra> ok, the content of the command line gets pasted from the kernel message
<ogra> i still only see "begin: Running head for script /usr/share/finish-install/finish-install"
<ogra> it never gets to "end: Back to main menu" and no errors occur (my test system is a headless server running a kvm guest though)
<ogra> and i cant find any additional details in /var/log/installer/debug either
<cjwatson> well, the problem here isn't the kernel
<cjwatson> I'm seeing a similar thing here
<cjwatson> it's in code called by the kernel before the initramfs runs
<ogra> so is this a kernel regression or is there something deeper that can be fixed ? 
<cjwatson> I don't know, that's why I'm asking you to log the debug messages
<cjwatson> I just wanted to ensure we didn't have a real problem here
<ogra> i cant access any logs apart from kern.log and dmesg
<ogra> and thats the content of /var/log/kern.log
<cjwatson> /var/log/boot is empty?
<ogra> no, but /var/log/dmesg is what i pasted above
<ogra> (and yes, empty, but thats expected)
<cjwatson> well, that won't give you much ...
<ogra> and no boot.log in /var/log/
<cjwatson> what hardware is this?
<ogra> my laptop
<ogra> intel atom netbook
<cjwatson> you were very quick to say "no boot.log"
<ogra> its running maverick
<cjwatson> I mean is it an imx51 or something similar?
<ogra> yup
<ogra> not running armel but i dont think thats special here
<ogra> imx51 that is
<cjwatson> ok
<cjwatson> what I'm trying to tell you is that /var/log/boot on an imx51 is empty because I didn't have time to implement that in the default kernel build
<ogra> understood
<cjwatson> did the initramfs ever run?
<ogra> i have an initramfs on the system if that makes a difference
<ogra> yes
<cjwatson> yeah, you have to press enter in order for it to actually try anything
<cjwatson> I mean, that's how it's supposed to work
<ogra> ah, ok
<cjwatson> this looks to me like something to file against plymouth
<ogra> well, i would guess there is more stuff that doesnt work if there is no luks
<ogra> or do you have that on lucid too ? 
<cjwatson> I have it on lucid
<cjwatson> what you're seeing is due to it not being there
<ogra> ok
<ogra> well, its a maverick build on maverick i think
<ogra> at least it didnt have any maverick stuff added in config
<ogra> ok, i have to leave for a bit now ... but filing a bug if the kernel logs reveal anything and i'll also look at the initramfs setup, just to make sure i dont overlook anything
<ogra> s/kernel logs/kernel logs for me/
<ogra> *if they</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:51
