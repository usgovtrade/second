And here's a song from the new album called "Let It Out" written by Justin Lillie & Scottie Wilkins. I'll keep working on this thread and keep posting videos as they come out. My band is called Shoe Blowers but we like to keep it low-key and just jam live. If we ever do videos on here we'll just have a low-key logo screen behind us or something like that. Here's a song from my latest video:

Hey, just saw this one. It reminded me of "Dancing in the Dark" by Bruce Springsteen. Liked it a lot!

This is great! I remember learning this in a jazz theory course back in the day and I can't believe I remember it. I haven't heard it in years and I guess it was playing in my head. Glad to find you all here too!

I am starting to collect some of these. We are planning on driving from San Diego to Seattle for Woodstock and are only keeping our guitars small and lightweight. This one is my wife's and she loves it.

What do you think of this one? I do not know anything about Trixter, but I think it is a good song! I have always liked it. I always just thought it was cool to see this guy with the sunglasses on (John McEnroe of tennis fame).

"You don't play with it enough. Do you know what that means? You work with it. You don't do the work."-Eric Clapton

That is so cool. It seems like we are getting more and more into the heavy metal. This song is awesome. This has to be the best track for me. I have no idea who he is, but I do enjoy his voice. He has a great attitude.

I got a lot of responses from other posters here and on youtube. The more I have listened, the more it has spoken to me. There are so many great choices for this thread, but if you didn't like some, we really appreciate your comments.

I've been so busy these past few days I've had no time to write much about the videos so I'm gonna finish off with some links of the other videos I like. Some were found by my wife and I on youtube (see below).

This is a great show! Awesome energy from the crowd! What about the guitar riff on his right?

What's up all? I'm trying to make a "video playlist" with the songs I've been posting in these threads, I've got so many videos now, not to mention I might wanna share other links. So bear with me while I'm uploading these songs to youtube.

These are some of my favorites and some of them aren't yet posted. Also, please help me find one more song by this artist for this post. Here are some other posters that can help:

My dad always likes to listen to Jimi Hendrix. I think this song is one of his favorites. I think you should do some of the other videos that are on youtube from it. That is how I found you!

Hey, this is great. I especially love the guitar parts. One of the coolest aspects of this video, in my opinion, is the video editing. Thanks for sharing this one. I hope I will hear more songs like this one.

I like the guitar work. Some may think it sounds like a cover but the main reason I like it is for its arrangement. The guitar playing is very simple, in my opinion, but still sounds very powerful and melodic.

Great, great song by an amazing band. It was one of my favorites from the first day of college in 1969. It wasn't in a classroom that day, but in a student lounge, as I sat waiting to take a final. The tune was "Mister, You're a Better Man Than I" by The Grass Roots. But one side of me was enjoying what I heard, the other side was thinking, "I am not sure what is going on here, and wonder where it is going." The great thing was that I did not know the words! After I heard the song in college, I still could not get to it again for the next few years, until I saw the movie "American Graffiti." I knew then I was "hooked" on The Grass Roots. I also think the "Truck Drivers" is my favorite song, the melody and words are so good.

Thanks to all the posters who contributed to these threads. You made the playlist much more diverse. Some people on youtube asked for me to do videos on some of these bands. So, I might do some future videos that have nothing to do with bands.

I have this video up at YouTube for quite some time now, and I still get new people asking me about it. I think it is great, and it is actually pretty hard to find. There is a song on there that is quite hard to find and I think most of you have it up. It is a "live" video from a band called The Tubes. The album is called "The Tubes." The lyrics in the intro were written by John Lennon. You see some young people in the video, and some older people, as well. So this video probably has some different meanings to it. For example, the song, "The End" starts off with "The End" by The Doors. Then "The Tubes" starts and there is an image of a man. Then there is "Tubular Bells" by Mike Oldfield. That song is mentioned in the next part, when the song says, "we're going on and on forever and ever and ever." The vocals, of course, are very different, but they have both been mentioned in their videos.

I hope that I gave you all some insight, and some of you will find this. I posted this video before for other people, but for this song it worked better to do it for me. I am so proud of that album. I am really proud of "Talk to Ya Later," too.

There are some songs that I wanted to make a video for and don't know how I can do it without ruining the song's integrity, so I put it here. If anyone knows how I can do this or has already made a video for a similar song, please post it here. This is a great song by The Who that I love. I don't even know where the hell the name is from.

"Drowned" by The Doors, they are a band that you don't hear all the time on youtube. I don't have any specific links to this song or video, though. And, the video is by some guy named "kaleysen" with the song called "drowned" by the Doors. I really hope that I'm not ruining any kind of "moral" or integrity of this song by posting this video here.

The "video" version of it will be up on youtube and I just posted it here to see if anyone could tell me anything about this song.

This is a good song that I enjoy, and has a cool song title. It is from the band called The Clash. I don't know if you could call them old, but they were at least starting to be known back in the late '80s. I don't know how or why I liked this song when I was a kid, but I like this one a lot. I hope that this video works for you. It is a video that I got off youtube by a guy named "Chelsea_Bergman." This is the official video for the song, and this guy had just put it up on youtube. Here is the link:

This was the last song that I tried. It is pretty hard for me to find the original video. There are tons of videos out there,</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:37
