Instead 
of a short, simple "hey - this is your site, use it and have fun" thing, 
they've got one with disclaimers, and some legal mumbo-jumbo. 
It's also a pain in the butt. Instead of "log in", it asks you to 
"create a user profile" - which is an empty directory in the site. 
You'd think these would try to simplify instead of complicate. There's 
nothing wrong with their site, and we are just confused.

It's been fun. I know there are some other folks out there in the real 
world using this page. But if you'd like to use something a little more 
professional, and have it a little easier on the eyes, you may wish to 
give the following page a look. It's a really nice web-page you've been 
waiting for, IMHO.


	http://www.ibiblio.org/hp/ecom

You are encouraged to use this page as your home-page as often as you wish 
and in any way you like. If you prefer, you can link to it from anywhere 
else on the Internet or anywhere you can put a URL. 


A special thanks to Dave S. for volunteering to do the legwork and compile 
the HP Documentation! And also for doing the whole thing over a lunch 
break, while I had lunch with an ex. We're big kids! ;-0)
