I got another one for you. I used one, with my brother, but my brother couldn't see a dang thing," explained Frankie.

Joe frowned. "Well, you can ask around and see if anybody knows what's going on. We'll try to go back to the restaurant tomorrow. But I have to get going. How about I take you two out to eat tomorrow night, just the two of you?"

Both Bob and Frankie were silent, as Joe tried not to look at them, since he knew his face would tell them how mad he was. "Did you hear me?" asked Joe, who looked directly at Bob. "Did you hear what I said?"

"I heard you," said Bob, who looked at Joe in shock, before he was snapped out of it by Frankie. "Look, Joe," said Frankie, who had seen Bob getting up out of his seat, "take him out to eat. Do what you have to. But I'm not letting you out of my sight until I get my damn money back."

Bob's jaw dropped and he stared at Frankie. "What are you doing?" Joe asked, seeing Frankie making hand gestures at Bob.

"I'm making sure he doesn't bolt," said Frankie, in the same vein of a child having one toy over another. "I think I'm gonna take him home and make him eat dirt."

"What?" Joe said in complete shock. He knew Bob wasn't a small man, and the man was so big and strong he was known around the block. But Joe had never seen anyone say that. Then the lights came on. Bob wasn't happy with what Frankie said. But he was still in shock that Frankie would try to control him in such a way. "How dare you!" Bob yelled at Frankie. Joe didn't know whether Bob was bluffing or not. He didn't know what to do, until Joe took a step back. He decided that he was done with them and he was making a mental note to not return to the area where Frankie and Bob were from.

He turned and looked at Frankie. "Go see what they're doing. I'll see you tomorrow," Joe said, as he walked off.

Frankie sat back down and looked at Bob. "You know I can make you walk home naked with your clothes on if you go near his daughter."

"I know." Bob's voice shook a bit as he looked down at the bar. Joe's brother, Larry, nodded at him, as did the other old men and women in the bar. Frankie walked off and Joe and Bob looked at each other, not saying anything else.

"Let's go, Frankie," Joe said.

"Are you sure?" asked Frankie. "He got away from us before. If it was me, I'd want to kill him."

Joe felt a chill run down his spine. He wasn't one to let something like this go, but he couldn't bring himself to say anything to Frankie. And he wanted to go home and eat. He figured the more he did, the faster he could go to bed and get up the next day to work, get the hell out of dodge. That was his plan.

"Joe? Joe, are you listening to me? Say something," Frankie pleaded. Joe nodded, and he knew Frankie was going to bring up Frankie's brothers. He knew how much Frankie was worried about them. And he knew how big Joe was, and what he could do if pushed.

"Frankie, I think you should go home," Joe said. "I think I'll go home and let you take Bob home."

"I can't believe this," said Frankie. "He's a monster. He's nothing but an animal."

Joe had heard enough. "If you're so worried about him, maybe you should go home, too. He doesn't deserve the time of day." Joe knew he was talking himself into walking out. He saw how Frankie had held his head high and he hadn't showed any fear. He knew there were a lot of times when fear made you stupid. But Frankie was brave. Joe had seen it when he was in the city when the two men were coming up on them, and then he watched Frankie get beat up. Joe admired Frankie and admired what he'd done for him that day. He didn't want to see Frankie get hurt anymore than Joe wanted to see him get hurt.

"Don't go, Frankie," Frankie said, grabbing Joe's arm and pulling him to a barstool. "I'm not going to back down," he said. He was so damn stubborn and he didn't know when to let up. It wasn't right for Joe to talk like that. "We can do this together. You said you were going to get us out of here one way or another, didn't you? If you won't do anything, I will. So, stop it, because I'm not going to back down." Frankie grabbed Joe by the shoulders and looked into his eyes. Joe never talked back to Frankie like he had. He knew he was looking at the boy who had fought for him. Joe felt bad.

"I didn't mean it," Joe said. "I just meant I don't know what to do."

"Joe, I know you and I know you're one of the strongest people I know," Frankie said, as he let go of Joe's shoulders. "And even stronger than I could imagine. You can do anything you want. You could beat a bull, bullfighting."

"Frankie, stop it. You're doing this for nothing," Joe said.

"Don't talk that way to me," Frankie said. "I'm not doing nothing."

"You're right," Joe said, before he turned around and left, before Frankie could talk anymore. Joe walked into the street, his hat in hand, and he began to walk away. When Joe got a little bit in front of Frankie, he turned around and asked him, "Why don't you go home? Let's forget about this and just get out of here."

"Frankie told me we were brothers," said Frankie, as he went into the doorway of a building, letting out a sigh as he leaned his back against the door.

"You were our boss," said Joe. "There's a difference. I was your employer. And that was the first time we ever came up on each other. And you were looking out for your brother, the big shot. You weren't looking out for me."

"I'm sorry, Joe," Frankie said. "I know you didn't mean to say it like that. You didn't have to. I know how you feel."

Joe nodded, but he walked away. They were both in over their heads. He didn't know how to help himself.

Frankie stood on the street and watched Joe walk away. He knew he had to get back to Joe's and go home before Frankie's family knew that he was there. Frankie knew he had been thinking too hard about the situation, and Joe was right. He wasn't looking out for Joe. Joe was the one trying to get them out of there, and he was right to not trust him. Joe was out of his mind and he wasn't in a position to think clear about the situation. He wished Joe would let him take him home. But Frankie knew it would never happen.

Joe walked a few blocks before he spotted a cab. He waved it down and it pulled up alongside him. Joe opened the door and got in, and when he turned around, he saw a police car that was headed toward him. Joe's heart began to beat fast. He knew what was coming, and he knew it was going to be rough.

The police car didn't stop, but it was the second time this week Joe was confronted by them. They drove by and continued on their way. Joe watched the car drive off, feeling the blood rushing through his veins, making him even more excited. This time he got out of there fast and was running like a person in a sprint to the street in front of the police station. He was so mad. He knew they had the wrong guy.

Joe reached the doorstep of the police station, but he ran past it. He couldn't go through the same thing again. He reached down and picked up a rock. He waited a moment and saw the police car come back. He threw the rock, and he watched it smash a window in the police car. The police car drove away and Joe went back to the sidewalk where Frankie was waiting.

"What did they want with you?" Frankie asked.

Joe looked at Frankie, knowing he wouldn't understand it. "They don't give a shit about me. They're just looking for an excuse to beat up some little guy. They don't give a damn. It's the law, Frankie."

"No, I'm sure it's not that easy," Frankie said, not understanding what Joe meant. "Some people get picked on all the time, and they never take action. Then there are others who get picked on all the time and get away with it, even when they have witnesses."

"What you want to do is tell</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:54:07
