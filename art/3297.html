What the Dems Are Afraid of Right Now

The Democrats have been in power for almost one-third of the term of Donald Trump's presidency. It is a political record matched only by one other administration: The Roosevelt administration. They are going to try to change that record this year.

The "Hail Mary" Pass - Dems Will Try Everything

Trump and the Hail Mary pass

The Dems are going to try to win the house back in 2020. The Dems need to make a few changes because if their history is any indication it could end poorly for them.

We saw just how poorly the history worked out for the midterms when you looked at the number of seats Democrats gained. I know it was the worst year since 1920 but that doesn't change the fact that since 1952 Democrats have never gained more than 32 seats in a midterm election.

The Democrats cannot afford to do what they did in 2018 because they would be playing with fire.

The Hail Mary pass will not work and it is not going to. This election will be lost but it is a loss the Democrats have to absorb because they cannot afford to not focus on what they need to do. This time, however, they have a chance to save the day and regain control of the White House.

They are going to do it by focusing on healthcare and tax reform. I don't know how many times I have written about this but Democrats need to stop thinking about healthcare and just do it. Healthcare is the #1 issue with the American people, even over the economy.

If you want to bring people together you have to do one thing: Fix healthcare.

I don't want to hear any more excuses and I don't want to hear any more complaints about the Republicans. These bills are not perfect but if the Democrats want to win in 2020 they have to stop whining and get moving. This will be an easy bill to vote for, unlike Obamacare. The time is now to act.

The Democrats need to stop listening to their base and to focus on the people who are the key to regaining the presidency. I am saying this as someone who does not live in a Blue state. I am telling you that if I lived in a Blue state, even a conservative Blue state, I would vote for single-payer health care.

Healthcare is not an issue that we can continue to ignore. Democrats, particularly Bernie Sanders, are dead wrong on healthcare. I will vote for single-payer healthcare over what they are trying to do. Let's just be honest with ourselves.

There is only one thing that we can do if we want to win and that is come up with a single-payer plan of our own, the only thing that can help people who cannot afford healthcare.

They have to offer a real solution and they can start by offering the people what they want.

These are tough times for Democrats. It's tough times for Republicans, but it's tough times for Democrats as well. The only people who are going to benefit if the party fails in 2020 are the Republicans.

The Dems need to focus on the healthcare plan and pass something before the midterms or they will have no choice but to start playing defense again in 2020.

I agree on single-payer except that it is being pushed as if this would be a miracle drug in and of itself. Single-payer is the least cost effective way of providing health care and the reason we have something like 70 million people without any health coverage is because single-payer drives up the costs of private plans and the number of people who are insured decreases. Single-payer will only work if it's combined with an ACA buy-in program with an annual insurance plan and private providers are allowed to sell any plan or insurance to anyone who buys into this. Then you can see how much single-payer would benefit average Americans.

Yes, I also don't like how the Dems plan of action on healthcare but it does not seem to be hurting them.

You are right. They don't want to give the GOP an easy win. As long as the Dems take their hit and hold the seat they'll win back the presidency.

So you think that the Dems will not take a hit from 2020 but they would win the presidency by then?

I am not saying that the Democrats will fail in 2020. I am just saying that if they are going to win back the presidency they will have to take on the Republicans. The time is now to make a big move.

Is the only option for the Dems to have everything be perfect in healthcare reform? No, but I think that they have a good shot at passing single-payer if they do not listen to the left-wing of the party and if they have another progressive who has the political pull to force the party in a direction that reflects the will of the people and of progressivism.
