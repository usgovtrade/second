The article does a terrible job of explaining the nature of the problem, but
the summary is that concrete makes a lot of use of aggregates of rock which
are often of sub-optimal size distribution, in particular because these are
not always readily available in ready-sized form. Making aggregates from rocks
of larger sizes, particularly aggregates of rocks which are used for the size
distribution of gravel, or making aggregate sized particles from a gas in a
particle reactor, are two ways to solve this problem.

On the problem of concrete's energy use: A large part of the energy used by
concrete in heating the aggregate to its boiling temperature comes from the
rock's own cohesive energy, which could be released using less energy.

_A large part of the energy used by concrete in heating the aggregate to its

My understanding is that the heat energy from the heating that this article is
about came from the sun.

This doesn't sound right to me. I know it's not as simple as putting some
chemical or material or something in to a concrete mix but I have a pretty
strong intuition this isn't what's happening here. What I would think would
happen is that the concrete, or at least the aggregates, would reflect more
heat from the sun on warmer days due to a more metallic, mirror-like surface
resulting from the heating of the concrete.

If it helps to make the point more clearly, think of how a solar water heater
works. A cheaply made one may be insulated, but it will not use a heat
conductor. A more expensive one will have a heat conductor, but the design
often incorporates a plastic outer coating to keep the conductor from
becoming too hot, making the whole thing more reflective.

You can get a more concrete comparison in a home air conditioner. In a window
air conditioner, the design will look similar to a cheap plastic case but be
more reflective. In the windowless A/C that you likely have in a house, the
outer casing will be coated in a far more reflective material. The more
reflective surface will allow for more sunlight to pass through the unit and
heat the room at the same time.

I think this isn't just some magical idea about how concrete absorbs heat. I
think this is very real. You can see it in the construction process of a
concrete building, where it is necessary to build a scaffold over the cement
slurry. This is done to prevent the heat from the heating of the cement from
causing the "raw mix" to heat up too quickly.

I know of a place in China where they were doing a lot of solar photovoltaic
installations. They would find this patch of dirt and cover it with concrete
and set up a nice big heliostat for tracking. I worked there for three
summers. I tried going around during lunch but nobody else wanted to. It took
a bit of walking to get from one side of the project to the other.

So these guys were building these giant solar heliostats that were only at
their peak output for an hour or so. Their biggest problems were:

1\. It wasn't hot enough and was causing a lot of stress on the electronics.
They were doing workarounds but they would only save a percentage of their
energy.

2\. It was too big and too expensive to make. They would get it up and
running, then wait too long and lose energy production.

Concrete is the obvious material that can be brought up to a working
temperature as quickly as you want, then cooled down without any mechanical
intervention. You could run an entire house off of the heat alone.

>It wasn't hot enough and was causing a lot of stress on the electronics.

How did they do that? How can you tell if it is the concrete temperature that
is the issue, or the electronics temperature?

~~~
hinkley
The panels didn't get hot enough on a particular sunny day (but those are
rare, they happen, usually on overcast days. This place is in the mountains
and a big foghorn is a daily annoyance).

One morning the guys came over to me and asked me to check our array, that
they thought they had found a problem. I grabbed the top two sensors, turned
them around and pointed them at the concrete slab (just in front of my desk)
and asked how hot they were.

They were up there in the 30s, which was hot enough to fry the electronics.

So what had happened was that they had been out there setting up the concrete
for another two weeks and the concrete was just shy of the point where the
panels stopped generating a significant amount of energy. So they opened up
the scaffolding, put the modules in, and the concrete had barely come up to
the bottom of the box. The concrete was hotter than it would have been
otherwise, but the electronics were in their breakpoint zone.

The concrete probably would have been hotter had it taken the full 12 hours to
reach 200Â° C. There's probably a complex tradeoff between concrete strength
and temperature in the curing process.

~~~
hinkley
They had taken a couple of days off that last day. It was a pretty good
technique. They mixed it before work and had it ready to pour by the time they
got to work. It was really, really well prepared.

~~~
pfdietz
I suspect the concrete was prepared, but its use was compromised by the fact
that the concrete was poured into a pre-heatshed, so that it wasn't reaching
the peak temperature for long.

~~~
hinkley
I suspect you are right. My memory is a bit fuzzy, it was a while ago.

Huh? Can someone elaborate what he's talking about? How would this work? What
particle type, in what amount, does what?

~~~
bregma
I think they mean metal particles that do not bind too strongly to the
concrete, and/or that are small enough to not form particles with diameters
larger than the micro-slit of the aggregate. Or something like that. But a
good explanation would help.

I have a suspicion that the amount of "particle type" is probably the wrong
word to use. Any metal particle with a melting point lower than that of
concrete (typically 1300 deg C) should do the trick.

~~~
shkkmo
Ok. I'm going to do a bit of experimentation then. I want to create my own
graphene and see what I can do.

It reminds me of those solar thermal collectors that resemble a giant
asphalt/concrete rooftop.

Solar Turbines, which I've seen a lot in the southwest, really have the same
concrete feel:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_turbine)

They remind me of huge (but thin and bendy) sheets of corrugated steel.

~~~
TheOtherHobbes
A friend in construction and engineering calls them "fat steel tubes" and says
they're inefficient, and they're expensive. I've never been able to find out
if this is true or not.

What does happen is that you can sometimes sell a big roof collector for
$250,000, so that adds to the cost of the solar company's margin.

The whole business is weird. There's something about selling something
slightly more valuable than gold that seems incredibly profitable, and there's
no way to price that into conventional models of revenue, so it becomes an
amorphous black box.

Interesting.

I wonder how large the materials were, and</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:35
