basically no one in the world
outside of the G8 countries could buy one of
the big computers that Apple
made, and by 'big' I mean in the sense of
like an Airbus A380. These guys
were the only people in the world with
enough money to buy a big computer.
So, they were like, "okay, well I guess
we're not gonna buy them back
and then the Chinese computer companies
couldn't use all of that technology." So
the big computer companies were like, "okay,
we can't use this
technology and you're basically not gonna buy it."
So, how are we gonna sell all this stuff? We had
this new strategy called the App Store.
Now if you're really familiar with the way that
computers work now, you might be
surprised that there are an
app for everything. Like, how do you--
how do you remember what that was called?
[Student answers] App Store. Exactly,
App Store. So, now we could
get anyone anywhere to be able to buy and download
stuff, like music, like apps,
like anything, on this computer that's cheap
and it's small. We made a lot of
money out of that but we didn't really plan
that far ahead. So, this worked out.
The other thing was iPods. At first, it was
just like, "okay, we're gonna sell
these iPods." Everyone just thinks the iPod is like
your mp3 player right now and
you buy it and it's small and then you put
whatever you want on it and
it's a small disk and
it's got a screen and it's got some buttons
and you put it in your pocket and you go.
What's really important about the
original iPod is that it
became the only easy way to listen to music
with your computer, and then you'd
go into iTunes and you would buy the songs
and then the songs that
were from The Beatles and it would put
them onto your iPod. It's
really easy for the first time because we've
built a bunch of machines that
all had a certain feature that was really
important, which is a very tiny
little black hole into which you put
files that you wanted to manipulate.
A lot of other computers that exist-- I can't
find my-- the one I'm talking about-- the
Compaq-- but it's a very well known type of
computer. Like, in fact the first computers
were basically like this. If you wanted to write
on it, you had to write with this,
you could print out a
punch card and then feed it in. You have to
put the punch card in the right way, which
is tricky. Then the computer would grind it
out. We have lots of devices that are
this kind of dumb device but then they all
have this file. Like, if it's got a disk and
you want to open it, it's got this thing to
open it. This was this very small black hole
and we could put these very small
data files into this thing and then
the computer can do its job,
process them, and sort them, or delete them
or make duplicates of them,
or whatever it is that it does. All these
features on this particular computer, and
this is what we did with a
lot of computers and Apple does with
everything. The most important computer we
ever made is the Macintosh
and this is because it's so well known.
Everyone knows it. The best example of that
is here's another computer. This is a Mac,
it's the same thing as the other one
but it's much bigger. Okay? So here's a
computer that's like the Mac that
you have at home. So, basically it's a computer
with the keyboard and the mouse but
it's actually inside a giant cube, because
that's all you need. You
can fit a bigger screen if you want and then
you can do whatever you want to it but
it's just easier for people to understand
this. If you're a software company or
a user, this is how you buy your computer.
It's simple enough that everyone can do it.
Every single one of these things is based
on the idea that you just
put some stuff on this thing and then you do
the other thing, and then you get the result
of the other thing. That's how it is. What
we really want now is, can we make
something that is really like the Mac,
but really good for us? Like, I have to
work on my
Mac. The same thing has to run on my
computer. I need it to be really
easy to use. You know what would be cool?
You wouldn't be able to open up the computer.
Like this one-- so if you had a Mac,
you'd basically buy it, put it together, and
then you could make it do anything you
want with it. It would stay exactly the same,
but now you have all these cool devices that
are very like the Mac but don't have the
Mac name. They're just the Mac, like a Mac
with this weird case. You can plug it into
it, like this one here,
and then you can buy stuff. And we said, "okay,
so the Mac is just a computer that was easy
for a single user to use and we wanted to
make a bunch of things that were like
that." What we need to do is make
it so that multiple people can use the Mac.
So, we made all kinds of these things that
were really like Macs but they were
designed to run with their own little
screens and their own keyboards and
that they were really focused for the
individual who was using it. So, this was
the story of iPods and what iPods got
you was the first step to having the Apple
music store, which gave you
a lot of power. The Mac itself, you could buy
it but you could do it for the other reason,
which was, "hey, I want something like this,
but it's not just for a single user. It's
for me and my colleagues." And that's how the
keyboard with the special things on it comes
in.
Now we have other people who have Macs so
they could use them too.
What we'd like to do now is to basically
make the Mac, if not a single computer, a
computer that can connect to all these
other Macs, but one that's really well
connected. Like, it would have all these things
that the people who have them right now
can't get on the Mac and they can't have
them. It'll do stuff that's useful
for businesses and for schools and for other
things, but in order to do that, we're gonna
have to have all this stuff in one place.
So, it won't be an app on the Mac. It's
just in this computer here. We're gonna
have a big database. We've put all the songs
in a database and we're gonna keep doing that
so that it can access that database,
but that's not enough,
because it can't go and search the database
itself. And here's the thing that's super
important: when we were making the iPod,
we made sure that we'd have something for
it when it came out. You had to buy the iPod
and then, one year later, when the new
iPod came out, you had a new thing
that would have the old songs on it. So,
I mean this is great. This is all
the songs that I've bought so far and then
I have these other things that are coming
out that are different, so they have all
the songs that are on them so I can get it.
That's great, but if I just want to look at
what's new--
what's new-- because I know all the stuff I
already have, why don't I just want to get
that new stuff? It's a computer
and all this stuff is on it. So, let's put
all the songs in one place, right? But
how does this differ from the iPod? Well,
everyone has this Mac and we could put all
the songs from the world on there. They
could all be in one place.
Now we can have that. Now I just want to know
what's new, but it's not going to work for
the reason that it's not going to give me
what's new. I need to get what's new for
all of my friends, too, so they're not going
to put it in there. Because then all my
friends can just get it and they get all
the stuff that I have. We really need
to do something about that, so we need to
make these special things. It doesn't matter
if it's out of date when you buy it. We
should just put it on there, and then if you
get a newer one, we should give it to you
free. That's</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:11
