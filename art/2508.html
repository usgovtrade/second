And there is a second level where the reader has to be fluent enough in Greek
to pick up the meaning of a word in the context, whether or not it's something
the reader would typically encounter in English.

I used to work at a university which had one of these stacks. When you were
asked to read an article in the stack, you didn't really even get a choice,
you just had to go find a stack and bring it back with you. And of course this
would take you half an hour, so you weren't going to be reading more than one
article during the day...

To this day I still consider it to be one of the most boring jobs in the world
(I have never been unemployed).

I would rather be paid $40 an hour to put my books in order by the door of the
closet than ever work in a library again.

As the former (now sadly defunct) library director for one of the largest
universities in the world, I must protest this assessment. We would _never_
just tell you to find a stack. If you had been trained to find a stack, you
could have found a stack -- you _would_ have found a stack.

And I must take umbrage with your characterization of library work as an
uninteresting job, even on a day-to-day basis. I know people who _love_ their
jobs at libraries. There are challenges, there are rewards, and there are
never enough hours in the day to do it all well.

That is a good point -- I guess my point of view is from the point of view of
a student trying to finish my assignments quickly... I would much rather be at
the reading lounge with the music blasting and a coffee machine :)

If I could find an article on my topic in a stack that I liked, I would read
it immediately. However, I think one of the biggest challenges at work is
knowing that you won't finish the assignment, so you take whatever you can
get... then you get an hour of lunch... and repeat the next day.

Good point. In general though, it's been my observation that libraries are
poorly suited to people with lots of immediate demands on their time (like
students, and the like).

I don't know about stacks and card catalogues, but for bibliographic access
we're using "Faceted Search" as an alternative to Google! It's a work in
progress at the moment but is really fun and powerful. I hope that you like it
as much as we do :)

For those who are interested, there's a follow-up to this post
[http://www.kosmopolit.com/2011/01/26/kosmos-2011-a-stack-
of-...](http://www.kosmopolit.com/2011/01/26/kosmos-2011-a-stack-of-books/)
that went into the history of libraries, and then in more detail about
digital libraries and digital books and digital text.

In addition to the books and the card catalog, there was usually a pile of
"crap" to sort. Most of it was printed on "cheap paper" such as brown paper,
tissue paper, or old newspapers. The "crappy" papers would also have ads for
things like snake oil or counterfeit bank notes printed on them. The sorting
of the "crappy" books was a bit difficult but it could be managed.

The real problem was where you didn't have the option to throw out the books,
because of some kind of legal reasons, often a copyright issue. I had to keep
the books sorted and organized and we tried to find a way to make the books
somewhat accessible to users (not the crap). Sometimes we had to throw away
the crappy papers.

The worst place I had to deal with was with public records. The "legal" part
of the job was sorting through all the old public records from cities,
counties, states, and countries and making sure that the copies were clean
enough to be usable for anyone who wanted to access them. I got the idea of
the "public library" from "crappy" books but the real "libraries" had to deal
with the public records. I would often be left wondering about the legal
obligation of the "archives" to keep a certain level of legal "accuracy".

I still miss my "crappy" paper job, but I did learn to love the "libraries"
with no restrictions on "accuracy".

On one occasion I had to sort some very old, well-thumbed comics of the 1940s.
In addition to all the usual stuff you find in old books, there was also some
very detailed drawings of anatomy, including some anatomically-correct genitals
in women's clothing. It was a weird experience.

I once got an internship at an academic library at UC Berkeley during the
middle of a quarter. The work I was hired to do was to re-acquire some rare
books to bring them back into the catalog, which was part of their collection
(most of which was just books on display).

One day, I was asked to help this woman who was getting ready to get married
at UC Santa Barbara (where she was studying). We went down into the basement,
up the elevator, into a section of the library, and up a very large set of
stairs into a reading area. There was a card catalog, and I was shown how to
use it by this woman. I spent most of the morning getting to know this one
card and finding all these books, and a few articles of information on them,
and sending this woman an email to tell her what I had found.

The only reason I got the job was because I knew C++ pretty well and had
experience in large code bases. A year later, they didn't need me anymore.

A friend (as a child) was responsible for arranging the book section of a
national hospital (for children). He used to take his school backpack full of
random books into hospital waiting rooms. The children would immediately flock
around him to see what he had gotten. Many came up asking him to search
something up, but never with books in hand.

I was supposed to help my grandpa find the books in the library of a private
academic library where he worked in the early nineties. They have a nice
database of the books held at the library, which is actually used for ordering
books to be purchased by the patrons. He said that while it was possible to
find everything by searching, there was no way you could be sure that your
order was correct.

"He also explained how he had come up with the library's name - in the Roman
world, libraries were known as bibliotheca, the plural of which is
bibliotheca. The name has stuck and 'library' is still used around the world
today"

I have often wondered what is a roman library called? This is because I had
the impression that in general a library is not only filled with books, but
that it should also contain something that resembles book-shelves or shelves
of book-like objects.

So does google.

This might make a decent filter to have as part of a query in addition to
google web search.

And "books" is usually a misnomer. These days it's any media where content is
