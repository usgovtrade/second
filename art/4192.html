"It's outrageous to see Republicans being mean-spirited and just saying, 'Oh, well, you're crazy' and 'Here's the new line,'" said Democratic Rep. Bill McCamley, who said he was just a "vocal Democrat" because of his position.

"I'm a Democrat and I'm proud of that," he said. "I'm proud to be in the majority for the first time in over 20 years. That's why I'm speaking out, because people are going to need to understand that I'm more than just a little voice here or there."

McCamley posted a video Thursday in which he spoke against what he called "trickle-down obstruction."

The Republican majority, with McCamley and his two Democratic colleagues, had passed HB511, an immigration reform measure. However, Republicans in the House and Senate weren't going to let the bill pass out of their respective chambers.

The bill's failure led to McCamley talking about "trickle-down obstruction."

"When we are allowed to have a debate, we're allowed to have debates over issues that are really important," McCamley said in the video. "What I'm against is trickle-down obstructionism."

He added, "Let's be grown up about this."

McCamley isn't the only lawmaker frustrated with the political tactics. Rep. Steve Fischmann, D-Las Cruces, said the tactics of Republicans have made it hard for him and other Democrats to represent their constituents.

"I think it's wrong," said Fischmann, a 10-year legislator.

"I think they can hold their own ideas and at least listen to our ideas but we can't even hold our own ideas."

Gov. Susana Martinez, who has vetoed similar bills in the past, said last week she will support this bill and will work toward passing it as soon as possible.

The bill does not address a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants or provide any funding to make up for what the bill would eliminate.

Editor's note: A previous version of this story stated that the speaker of the House had been changed from Kevin Rader to Republican Richard C. Moore. However, Rader remains the speaker. We regret the error.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify that Gov. Susana Martinez does not support the bill as it stands.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:08
