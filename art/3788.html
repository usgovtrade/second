Stage versions 

Stage versions of tracks from the 1964–65 period (titled 'Goffin/King') were originally released on the two-album set The Best Of Kinks (2002). A CD was also issued that featured a bonus track, a solo Kinks recording of "You Really Got Me" from the 1966 album Something Else. The two albums were re-released in 2006 as The Kinks Present The Very Best Of (1966–1974) as part of the "2-Tone" series of singles and albums.

Kinks on Holiday was released in 2005. The band appeared in four segments: "First Period: Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One" - "Dandy", "Tired of Waiting for You", "Well, Well, Well", "Sitting in the Midday Sun"; "Second Period: Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part Two" - "Fancyman Blues", "Cruising", "She's Got Everything", "Autumn Almanac", "Sitting in the Midday Sun"; "Third Period: Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part Three" - "Set Me Free", "A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy", "We're All Water", "Alcohol", "You Really Got Me", "Wait Till the Summer Comes Along"; "Fourth Period: Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part Four" - "Woman", "Till the End of the Day", "The Village Green Preservation Society", "I'm Not Like Everybody Else", "Sunny Afternoon", "Dedicated Follower of Fashion", "Waterloo Sunset"

Reformation (1991–2000)

In 1991 the Kinks' contract with Mercury expired. The band were unable to agree a new deal.

In the meantime, tensions were rising within the band. During a 1991 concert at the Kentish Town Forum in London, some of the band's fan club members (who were close to Rourke and Cook, and also distrusted Dudgeon) attempted to force Rourke and Cook out of the band at the conclusion of the show. Afterwards they were all given police escorts out of the venue and separated into four separate taxis.

Following the Kentish Town Forum incident, Dudgeon decided to leave the band, and they went on a farewell tour with a new, reconfigured line-up of Rourke (bass), Cook (drums), Dave Walker (guitars), Jim Rodford (keyboards), Mark Haley (vocals), and R. J. MacNamara (vocals). There were three new songs written for the tour, with Rourke singing lead vocals on two of them: "You Want It, You Got It" and "Watching TV", which was about watching television.

The tour began in the United States, but was cancelled when Dudgeon refused to join them. Dudgeon's departure would be the beginning of a long legal battle, which was finally settled in 1996.

In 1998, Rourke and Cook were replaced by Steve Severin (ex-Pretty Things) and Johnny Venus (Laurie), although they were not formally inducted into the Kinks line-up at this time. During the tour, the band continued to play "You Really Got Me", which marked their first live performance of the song since the band's 1970 tour. This version of the song was released on a 2-CD compilation album A Rock 'n' Roll Alternative, which was released by Eagle Records. Severin also wrote some new songs for the tour, which would be released as two new albums: Misfits (2001) and I See The Light (2003). A DVD of the tour was recorded in August 1999 at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, and released in December 1999.

2002–present: Reunion
After a 10-year hiatus, the Kinks got back together for a series of four concerts in Hyde Park, London in 2002. In March 2003, the band decided to make a studio album to continue the reunion. An edited version of one of their Hyde Park performances, "Come Dancing", was released on the The Kinks Choral Collection - The Kinks Choral Collection in 2003. The album features eleven Kinks cover songs (along with a new song "Little Miss Nothing"). They also did a tour of Europe during 2003.

In February 2004, the Kinks announced that they would release their first studio album in 16 years, You Really Got Me, in July that year.  It was preceded by their first single, "Celluloid Heroes", which had been released in September 2003. They released another single in September 2004, "A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy", which was a tribute to Elvis Presley's famous song "All Shook Up". It was written after the Presley's death, and was inspired by memories of seeing Elvis in concert as a child. The album also included covers of other rock and roll songs such as Hank Williams's "Move It on Over", Willie Dixon's "You Can't Catch Me", and John Lennon's "Twist and Shout". It was released by Virgin Records, which the band signed a recording contract with in 2000.

The band toured Europe throughout 2004, doing concerts in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Italy and Spain. In 2005, the group issued another studio album (an EP, in the United States) called Soap Opera. It was a compilation of three outtakes ("Something Else", "A Thin Smile", and "Grow Old With Me") and a new track ("You Were on My Mind"), all dating from 1965–66. Ray Davies commented that these outtakes were being re-recorded "because we like it, and we think they're our best songs, and also because it's not really fair to our fans". The album was also issued as a vinyl EP.

In June 2006, the band released their new studio album Strangers, consisting of several outtakes from their first two albums, plus five new songs. Strangers was released as the Kinks played their first concerts in the United States since 1993, a series of dates in Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis and the East Coast (New York, Boston and Washington D.C.). The band also played several concerts at Hyde Park in London and Southend-on-Sea in Southend-on-Sea, England. In 2006, the Kinks appeared on the stage of the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Woodstock Festival in August. The performance was simulcast on MTV and VH1, as well as available to view on the Kinks' website. Also in 2006, Rourke and Venus were replaced by original Kinks bassist Pete Quaife and drummer Jim Rodford.

The band released the album Schoolboys: Special Edition on the Kink Kronikles label. This was a re-release of the 1966 album Schoolboys with six bonus tracks. Schoolboys was re-released on LP and CD in 2007.

On 30 September 2007, the Kinks released the album The Road to Rouen. The album is a collection of outtakes and out-of-print songs recorded between 1962 and 1966. The album has received favourable reviews and was produced by long-time Kinks producer Shel Talmy. It was released on the Kinks Kronikles label.

The band released the DVD Ray Davies in Concert at Hyde Park: Saturday 13 July in 2009 which contains footage of the Hyde Park concerts, and several new songs from their September 2005 concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
