India LNG project gets in-principle nod from Australia

MELBOURNE: Enron Australia Pty Ltd, the local branch of the energy giant, 
Wednesday received a $US3.5 billion in-principle approval from the Indian 
government to proceed with its first LNG project in the impoverished state of 
Orissa. 
Aside from the energy giant and a consortium of 10 international oil 
companies led by Royal Dutch Shell, the partners in the $US7 billion plant are 
Japan's Mitsui and Mitsubishi, Britain's BG Group and Bechtel, US' GE and 
Cogema, France's Total and Societe Generale de Surveillance of Algeria.
With these partners, Enron will set up and operate an LNG plant in Orissa's 
block 12, the seventh licensing round for which was awarded in January 2000. 
The consortium will build a regasification terminal, an LNG import terminal 
and a mother ship to transport LNG. 
An Enron spokesman said the company now needed "a few months" to find 
"economic terms" with the Orissa state government for constructing the 
project. The state government wants Enron to make a financial commitment 
before the end of 2001 and has reportedly asked for $US200 million in 
payments upfront. 
The LNG plant will use ethane, imported from Algeria, and free on board (FOB) 
LNG to generate electricity. The project will supply 1,000 MW electricity to 
the state as well as gas to the fertiliser sector and industrial consumers. 
This is the first in-principle approval awarded since federal and state 
governments decided in May 2000 to privatise the LNG sector. It will also be 
the first project to be built through a PPA (power purchase agreement) as the 
Centre, under the Enron deal, has authorised the company to negotiate with 
state governments. 
The other partners are also in the process of finalising their PPAs with the 
Orissa government. 
"The in-principle approval gives us a free hand on the project's FDI (foreign 
direct investment)," an Enron India spokesperson said. 
The consortium plans to fund 70 per cent of the equity requirements for the 
$US3.5 billion project with 20 per cent in debt and a loan commitment from 
Morgan Stanley of $US1 billion, subject to a final investment decision. The 
balance will be from corporate debt and equity, the company said. 
There are 30 LNG projects in different stages of FDI appraisal in India. 
Of the 14 projects at different stages of appraisal that require foreign 
funding, 12 require direct foreign investment while the remaining need only 
foreign equity participation. 
Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Shell have all announced their FDI intents. 
Shell has said it would invest $US2.5 billion and Mitsubishi, $US1.5 billion, 
in two JV projects in the Krishna Godavari basin of Andhra Pradesh, one of 
which will be a 25 million tonnes LNG import terminal and the other a pipeline 
1,440 km long to carry C02-rich natural gas from the KG basin to the 
international market. 
In the case of Shell's project, it is also expected to involve BP Amoco, 
Reliance Industries, India's GAIL (formerly known as Gas Authority of India 
Ltd) and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). 
Last month BP Amoco announced its FDI plans for LNG in India, pledging $US1 
billion for upstream development of natural gas resources in India. 
At an investiture ceremony of Orissa's newly elected Speaker, Rabi Mohan 
Choudhury, Enron's managing director and chief executive Jeff Skilling said 
the Enron deal was a part of the Centre's policy to encourage private players 
to enter the growing Indian power sector. 
The Enron deal has been under the scanner of the Central Electricity 
Authority, the Orissa state government and the Opposition parties ever since 
it was signed in a star-studded ceremony at Houston's George R. Brown 
Convention Centre last August. 
The first LNG shipment, aimed at supplying energy to the power sector, is 
scheduled for late 2004 and the first delivery of industrial gas in early 
2005. The plant will be ready in two phases of construction, the first being 
commissioned in 2006.

USA: UPDATE 1-Southwest gets incentive to add Texas flights.
By Kala Rama

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DALLAS, June 3 (Reuters) - Low-fare carrier Southwest Airlines Co. said on 
Monday that the Texas Transportation Commission has approved an economic 
incentive package to add flights between two Texas cities and four cities in 
Florida. 
The TTC approved Southwest's request to fund 25 percent of the cost to add 
service to Austin, Texas, and Harlingen and McAllen, Texas, which would be 
served from Houston Intercontinental and Hobby Airport, starting in June.
Low fares on Southwest were one reason for last month's bankruptcy of Air 
Tran Airways, which had received a TTC grant to add non-stop flights to 
Texas. 
Southwest shares ended Monday's regular session at $12.68, down 25 cents.

India to block Enron power project

CALCUTTA, June 3 (AFP) - The Indian government will ban U.S. power giant 
Enron from taking part in a controversial power project in the western state 
of Maharashtra, officials said Monday. 
"Enron's role will not be allowed," a senior government official told AFP, 
without specifying who would bear the cost if Enron was not allowed to 
participate.
It was, however, learned that the company would not be forced to hand back 
any of its holdings. 
India's Maharashtra state is planning to buy Enron's local unit Dabhol Power 
Company in order to re-negotiate the $3 billion project's nearly nine-year-old 
power purchase agreement (PPA). 
The project has been mired in controversy since its inception, and faces 
several legal cases filed by local farmers who claim they have been 
overcharged for electricity. 
When contacted by AFP, a Enron spokesperson was unwilling to comment on the 
matter. 
On Sunday the head of Enron in India, Neil Mcgregor, said the company's 
decision to exit the project was driven purely by commercial considerations. 
Enron pulled out of the project in May last year following the Maharashtra 
government's failure to honor an interim payment of $48 million. 
New power contracts of five billion rupees (about $93.5 million) were signed 
with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) last month. 
Local media reports suggested that Enron and MSEB were unable to agree on the 
purchase price for the power. 
Enron was supposed to invest $2.9 billion in the Dabhol plant, but now it is 
set to lose its investment of $875 million as well as another $250 million in 
foreign exchange losses.
