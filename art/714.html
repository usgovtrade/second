so much fun...
I mean its going well I suppose.
but... 
I can't bear seeing her...
She's getting sick now,
and so it's harder for her to dance.
It was so painful.
I want to dance with her again.
Aren't you angry?
I want to dance... 
without seeing her, though.
Don't you know how to dance?

Spanish: 
I can't understand you.
I... wanted to see you again. 
Aki is looking after you.
She's told me all the time. 
She told me to dance. 
She said that it helps her get better. 
I... want to be alone.

English: 
Why did you say so?
I just didn't want her... to get sick.
I wanted her to dance with me. 
I can understand.
What do you think I should do?
This... 
was my own fault.
I...
you're quite an interesting person, though. 
Well...
I'll have to go. 
It was a good experience to meet you.

Spanish: 
Don't go. 
How do you know how to dance?
I was born knowing how to dance.
That's enough. 
Leave here.
I want to stay a bit more. 
It seems that... 
I can be happy here for a while.
But...
if you feel the same... 
I hope we can go together, 
when you're better.

English: 
Good bye. 
- Good bye.
I want to see you soon.
Welcome back. 
How are you?
It's cold here, isn't it? 
She was looking after her.
She was doing very well. 
We were just looking at the sea. 
She said she can't live with her. 
She will live with someone else, I guess. 
I don't know how I feel... 
about being apart from her. 
My feelings for her... 
I will never forget you, Shizuma. 
Even after I die, 
I will live inside your heart. 
I will love you forever.
Just like my own daughter.
So... 
Let's sleep together again.

Spanish: 
Yes. 
I can see you inside her mind, 
just like I'm inside her heart. 
In our dreams, 
we're together always. 
It's so... pure. 
Wonderful. 
It's beautiful. 
What?
You're both beautiful. 
She'll always be here.
I want to see her as well. 
It's going to take some time, though. 
She'll need a lot of time to heal.

English: 
So that's what I'll do now.
I'm sorry.
I didn't notice. 
You're quite beautiful, Sanae.
I'm happy to meet you here.
If you like that man... 
don't ever hesitate. 
He'll never forget you.
It will be me. 
Thank you so much for waiting for me, Sanae.
It was so cruel. 
I want to dance.
Let's be together forever, 
inside her heart.

Spanish: 
Are you angry with me?
Can you tell me your name?

English: 
I want to see you.
I want to see you dance with me.
I'll get some light. 
There's nothing left. 
They're only memories. 
I don't think I can forget them. 
I hope you're safe in your heart.
You don't look like someone
with such a beautiful and pure heart.

Spanish: 
Now that you're crying... 
I can tell you're sad. 
What's wrong? 
You must be very sad. 
You can't stand to be apart from her. 
I feel the same way. 
What did she tell you? 
She's here. 
She's crying. 
It hurts her. 
But she knows it's for the best. 
I want you... 
to be with her forever.
Sanae, 
I'll keep doing whatever you want me to do. 
I've fallen in love with you. 
I can live with your feelings, 
forever and ever. 
Are you crying? 
How will I live?
I want to dance with you, 
Sanae.

Spanish: 
I love you... 
and you can live with me. 
You'll be happy, too.
You'll be dancing forever... 
even when you're gone. 
Because that's what you do best.
What will you do?
I want to do what you do. 
I want to be like you. 
Let's dance together, Sanae.
Will we always be apart?
It's so painful. 
I think it's time to go. 
It's going to hurt, 
but we're together, anyway.
It's the end. 
I can't go on anymore.

English: 
She's calling you. 
Sanae,
please be happy. 
I'm so happy. 
I can't bear it. 
Do you hate me?
No... 
It was hard for me, too. 
I was happy. 
I want to be happy with you, Sanae. 
I don't want to be without you. 
I don't want to be lonely. 
Don't you hate me? 
I hate you, 
but...
But I can't leave you. 
I'll love you, until I die.
It was so hard to watch you struggle.
Because I was there. 
I couldn't leave.
Even if you don't love me.
You're so warm. 
You're beautiful, Sanae.
I love you.

English: 
I love you, too.
I've been waiting for you.
I've been waiting for you, 
Sanae.
Let's stay together... 
like this forever.
We won't be apart anymore.
She's waiting for you. 
She asked me to dance with her. 
You shouldn't have cried. 
I'm so sorry. 
Sanae.

Spanish: 
I know you can hear me, Sanae.
I can't bear seeing you cry. 
Let's dance, then. 
We'll always be together. 
Let's dance. 
Let's dance together.
She's waiting for you.
Let's dance together.
Let's keep dancing together forever, 
until she dances alone.
- I will love you, forever.

Spanish: 
She's always there,
and yet I can't see you.
She said she doesn't need us anymore. 
I love her so much.
She's still here. 
She was calling me. 
I can't see her.

English: 
What's wrong? 
I can't go on living.
I'm never going to see her again.
I want to be with you. 
Let's dance together. 
I love you.
I love you, Sanae.

Spanish: 
No. 
She's dead. 
She's here, 
and she's calling me. 
She said she's not going to see you again.
But she... 
she's just trying to make me happy.
I...
I can't see her anymore. 
I can't see you. 
I can't see you.
I've lost the light. 
I love you.
I love you, Sanae.

English: 
She was right.
She said she needed us.
What do you think we should do?
We'll do anything. 
I love you.
You can tell me.
I can't see you.

Spanish: 
I can't see you. 
I can't see you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:56
