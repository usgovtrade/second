This blog is called "The Violets of Kristiane" after a line in a song of Kris Kristofferson's that my friends and I interpret as having an anti-war sentiment, and this photo is called "Both went Bananas" since I like to think the image speaks for itself.

About Me

I'm a wife, mother, friend, cookbook author, and now blogger. I like to bake and cook as much as possible, given the demands of life with four young kids. I prefer nutrition and ingredients to fancy or processed foods, though I've been known to make a spectacular dessert from time to time. After 25 years in the corporate world, I am learning the ropes of being a home-based, freelance intrapreneur. My blog is where I get to express my thoughts on the world of business, cooking, and parenting. I started writing when I was president of the PTA Pop Warner chapter in Houston, Texas. Go Texans!
I like to hear from you, so leave a comment and let's get connected.

A Favorite Quote

“We are each of us homeless and pilgrims on the earth. We are everywhere at the mercy of good and evil. We are, in a very special way, owners and possessors of our days. We waste them, if we do not know how to use them. We squander them, if we are not aware that each day is a miracle.” -Evelyn Underhill</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:48
