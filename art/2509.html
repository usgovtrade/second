And that Trump subsequently used his office to undermine an investigation into the murder. The Republican-led House Intelligence Committee announced on Sept. 27, 2018, that it had concluded that evidence “does not support” a conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia, “including allegations of collusion and improper coordination with the Russian government.”

But these wild theories haven’t quite kept up with the news cycle. Now Trump’s son-in-law is the subject of wild theories that he’s had a secret relationship with Rudy Giuliani, even though Rudy himself told a New York radio station that this was “total nonsense.” It seems like people are looking for even more evidence that the Trump-Russia storyline is fake news. Trump, after all, continues to beat the drum that there was no collusion with Russia and that there was no obstruction of justice.

“I had absolutely nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected,” Trump tweeted in December, to be met with a familiar chorus of “not true” responses from congressional Democrats. “It was a hoax.”

But Trump’s enemies in the intelligence community and in the press keep peddling the story anyway, and Trump keeps whining about it as if there were actually something to it. Even for those of us who are on the right, Trump’s constant whining does sometimes seem like a dog chasing his own tail.

But maybe it’s useful as well. The news media aren’t always wrong, sometimes they can be right. And the reality of a president who never gets anything right is bad for our nation. That is a problem. The right has to be very careful that we’re not the one who makes the rules for the other side. They’re coming for us next.
