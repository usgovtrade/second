calculate MTM using FSPower.  This is a significant improvement over 
the traditional MRODE, SOB or CSA methodology used to estimate MTM for 
curtailments and transmission overrun taks.  The new method is 
described in a paper by S. Geeta and G. Kulkarni,  that was 
presented at the 2001 IEEE International Symposium on Reliability and 
Maintenance of Power Systems in  Washington, DC, June 28-July 1.  

For more details on this new MRODE-type method and other FSPower 
functionality, I encourage you to visit our web site at
