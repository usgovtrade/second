Once に対して is about one person or one thing doing something to another person or thing. For example:

自分の家を買ったので 新たな家が どんなにくつかかっても いいだろう
  I bought my own house and no matter how many houses we've had, I'm okay with a new one now. 

Here, 新たな家が どんなに くつかかっても isn't the object of よくなる. It means that there's no change in the quality of the home being bought. 
You can also see that どんなにくつかかっても isn't an adjective phrase or clause which would be at the end of a sentence. 
When に対して is an adverb modifying the verb ね, we usually interpret it as relating to a particular person.

A:

I think you can express this concept in Japanese as 「どんなに...かかってもいい」 but I personally find it rather difficult to use. 

どんなにがらくたを食べたくなったら、お母さんに叱られたでしょう。
  No matter how much you want to eat （as much as possible）, you must be scolded by your mom. 
どんなに朝ごはんを食べたかやがって！
  Get lost eating as much as you want for breakfast. 
どんなに勉強するのが好きなのに、英語との接点がなかったら、面接できないでしょう。
  No matter how much you like studying, you won't be able to get a job without speaking English. 
どんなに大学を行きたかったかだけなら、その分、大学に行きたくても、収入は少ないかもしれません。
 もちろん、「どんなにしたい」を考えているだけなら、それだけで十分なほどの収入を得ることができます。
 As long as you have that strong desire to go to a big university, it might not be possible to make ends meet. But as long as you are only thinking of that, I am sure you can make a decent living.
(I think the last sentence needs some elaboration.)

By the way, 好き or したい is not enough. If you want to emphasize that you are truly interested in whatever it is, 本当に好き (or 本当にやりたい) is better. 

どんなに食べてもおいしい　≒　どんなに食べてもおいしいのだが、なんのために食べるのであれば、なんかがんばったときに摂取することが大切だ。
どんなに本が好きでも、映画は見ることが難しいかもしれない。(I can't watch a movie. Even if I like books, movies may be difficult to watch.)

Another interesting thing: (I have no idea how this expression can be used for a person's character, but if you are a boss to your employees at your business, or as a supervisor in a school, or something like that, I guess you can use this expression in a negative way.)

私は何でも言いません。どんなに厳しいことでも言えません。 
I'll say anything. I'm not afraid to say anything.
I'd like to stay one step ahead of the other worker, so I should be nice to them. They should never have to worry about me saying something unfriendly to them.
I prefer my employees to be nice to other workers in front of me.
I don't like my employees to speak bad about the other workers.

I guess these are not very common usage cases.

EDIT: I wanted to write a comment, but then it would be a bit out of context, so I put it as an edit on the original answer.
If you do not necessarily like or dislike anything, saying 好き or したい is not enough. To emphasize that you are not being influenced by other things, adding 本当に could be a good alternative. 本当に is not only used for the past. I think 本当は is very close to 本当に. For example:

学生生活がどんなに続かなかったか 好きなことだったかもしれない。
I may have preferred staying in high school. I might not have had an awful life, you know.
あの試験が受かって本当に良かったのかはわからない。
I don't know if I passed the test really well or not.

For たい, I think 必死にやる is common. (I am not sure about "force").

彼はいつでも笑ってくれるんだ。 彼もまた必死に笑ってくれるんだ。
He's always laughing at me. He also laughs at me whenever I try to make him laugh.

I think 本当にやりたい is quite uncommon.

If the speaker feels strongly about the negative side of a situation, using うんてんで could be good, but it seems a bit over the top. 

彼はどんなに激しい会話も、うんてんでしまった
He's always speaking harshly to me.

Maybe one can say うんてんでいる to stress that he really is doing that.

彼はどんなに嫌な言葉をもらったくらい、うんてんでいるのかもしれない。
I think he might be speaking harshly to the extent he can.

A:

In this case, it is difficult to say, as there is no object.  
I think, it is more easy to say, when there is no object, in the case of negative imperative.  

"I think I can do that" can be expressed like "I think I can do it." (for example "I think I can run as fast as I want.")  
"I think I can't do that" can be expressed like "I can't run as fast as I want."

Without any object, how do you interpret "I think I can eat all the foods"? (It is difficult to say the meaning of 「どんなに」 here.)  
It is not necessarily a single "object," sometimes, "all the things" or "anything" can be used as an object for 「どんなに + [noun] + かかってもいい」, for example,

あなたの勉強がどんなに苦労したか知らないけど、それを助けてくれたわ。
  I know how much of a pain it was for you to study, and you helped me with it.  
どんなに友達が増えるかもわからないけど、それを維持するのが大事だな。
  I can't say anything about how many friends I would have if they grow, but it's important to maintain them.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:16
