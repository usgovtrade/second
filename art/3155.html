"Come on, now." "We're gonna get you into a hot bath and some clean clothes." "Go on!" "There's a good fire in the stove." "You can just build up the blaze." "We'll be in in a minute." "I'll just see to Pappy first." "And then you can make out a list." "I don't wanna make out a list." "Oh, I know what you don't want." "You don't want to have to apologize to them." "You don't want to have to apologize to me either, but I'm making out the list anyhow." "I'm coming, Pappy." "PAPPY:" "Well, come on now." "You look like a little Dutch boy." "Come on!" "I'm coming!" "I don't want you to be scared." "There's nothing to be scared of." "Go on!" "Look at that!" "What is it, Papa?" "It's an elephant!" "PAPA:" "You never saw an elephant." "He looks like a monster." "I don't see no monster." "That's funny." "I thought I heard one." "He can't be an elephant." "Look!" "He can't be!" "No, but he's a nice elephant." "Go on!" "You go on." "Give him to me." "There now!" "Come on!" "He's scared." "It's all right." "He'll get used to you." "What'd he do?" "Oh, he just sort of backed up a little." "He won't hurt you." "Now he can't hurt you!" "Look at that baby." "Why, he eats beans too!" "I can't stand this!" "Let's get out of here." "And go where?" "I don't care!" "To the jungle." "The jungle?" "Are you crazy?" "It's hot and it's damp and full of wild beasts." "You won't be scared there, I promise you." "I'm scared of everything." "Nothing could hurt me because I'm so tough." "Look, when I was little, I once saw..." "No, he's busy now." "We can't go in now." "Why don't you show him your knife?" "My knife?" "Oh, yeah!" "All right." "Okay." "Watch this!" "Wait'll you see this knife." "Here we are." "Oh, I can't see anything." "You look." "You look." "Who do you think you are, the king of England?" "Well, you look!" "You!" "Tootie, tootie!" "You're tickling me." "Shame on you!" "Hey, you can't do that to Papa." "Now, come on." "Look, I'll show you." "Ouch!" "Oh, be careful!" "What did I tell you?" "I could have chopped that thing in two." "Wicked child!" "Wicked, wicked child!" "MAMA:" "Shame on you!" "It's lucky I'm not angry with you." "NANCY:" "Well, I am!" "NANCY:" "Come on." "Come on." "Stop it!" "NANCY:" "Stop that!" "NANCY:" "What's the matter?" "Is Tootie sick?" "Tootie's just restless." "Don't worry." "We better stay home." "You know your father has a hard enough time without you scaring him to death." "Who?" "What?" "Me?" "Nah!" "Well, you..." "All right, Papa." "Uh-uh, I'll be good." "Yeah." "Yeah." "I'm sorry I wasn't brave." "Oh, Tootie!" "Honestly!" "Well, it's only because you..." "Oh, you'll never know what I've been through today." "Tootie?" "Tootie!" "Wake up!" "You won't believe what happened to your father." "Did he get kicked by a horse?" "No." "A cow?" "Uh-uh." "An elephant?" "Mm-mm." "Well, then, what?" "An air cushion fell on him." "What's he talking about?" "Wake up!" "He's joking." "Now, come on, come on, and see for yourself." "Come on, come on." "Go away!" "I'm asleep!" "Come on, come on, Tootie!" "Now you'll see." "Come on." "You'll see." "Tootie, look at the front door!" "A big, big bird...!" "Wake up, Tootie." "There's a big bird..." "PAPA:" "Papa, make him go away!" "What's the matter?" "Oh, you can't frighten me!" "Tootie, I know what you're thinking." "Oh, will he ever go away?" "Well, he is a big bird, but he's a kind one." "Papa, make him go away!" "Make him go away!" "Go away." "Don't look at me!" "We're busy." "Go away." "Go away." "Oh, Papa, make him go away." "Make him go away." "I can't make him go away." "PAPA:" "You make him go away!" "You're pretending." "You're making believe." "Now, come on." "Now, come on." "Get up now." "Get out." "Oh, Papa, make him go away!" "You're pretending!" "You're pretending, too!" "Get out, Tootie." "Tootie!" "Tootie!" "Oh, Tootie!" "Don't!" "Tootie, stop that!" "Tootie, don't!" "Don't cry, darling." "Please don't cry." "Papa will make him go away." "Now, look." "Look at Tootie." "Look at Tootie." "Look, Tootie." "Now, you see?" "He's a brave baby." "He's a brave little baby." "He's a baby." "He's a baby." "Papa makes him go away!" "Now, now, now." "Papa will make him go away." "You'll make him go away, yourself!" "You mean, he won't be here anymore?" "Of course not." "He's going away forever." "Oh, you're making it." "Well, we can't pretend with him." "He's really going." "Papa, make him stay." "Make him stay, Papa." "Make him stay." "I'll give you a green ribbon to tie in his hair." "Or a red one." "Papa, make him stay." "You know, he is going away." "Papa, make him stay." "Now do you see what you've done?" "Now, come on." "Come on." "I've got to put on my face, anyhow." "Please be a good girl." "Oh, Tootie, you look beautiful." "Be careful." "Don't touch anything." "We're gonna get the boat all wet." "Oh, you look so beautiful, Tootie." "Oh, Tootie, you look wonderful." "Be careful so you don't catch cold." "Now, don't lose the ribbon." "Oh, Tootie, you look so beautiful, I'm worried." "Don't worry about the ribbon." "Now, now, careful." "I look awful!" "Oh, you're a knockout!" "They'll notice you right away." "Now, be careful on the gangplank." "Don't trip." "Oh, by the way, don't tell the neighbors how you got your new dress." "Bye!" "Don't worry." "She'll probably be back." "I'll kill her." "WILLIE:" "Wait a minute!" "Tootie, where are you?" "Tootie?" "What's the matter?" "Did Tootie scare you?" "Let's get her." "Wait a minute!" "I'll get you Tootie!" "You can't get me." "You go round the other way." "I'm on to you." "I'm right behind you." "Tootie, where are you?" "Tootie, darling!" "Tootie!" "Tootie, darling, where are you?" "Tootie!" "Oh, Tootie, where are you?" "Oh, thank heavens!" "Oh, darling, are you all right?" "Oh, darling." "Oh, I was so frightened." "I heard you yelling." "Oh, I was so frightened!" "Oh, I've looked everywhere for you." "Oh, darling, what happened?" "I was out walking, and a big bird..." "What?" "Tootie!" "Then I was running after the bird..." "Well?" "...and I slipped on a big stone and I cut my knee." "But never mind about that." "Oh, darling, we must find that bird." "Shh!" "Oh, darling." "Maybe it's still hiding somewhere in the cellar." "What, what?" "Maybe it's down in</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:38
