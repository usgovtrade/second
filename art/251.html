the kids are on their way to the guillotine. 
    (g)  It's like, uh, you guys at
 Enron paying off a D in accounting. 
If you fail to
keep the stock price up, you die and I don't
know if I can have a baby. I'm not the one
    doing the talking. 
You know, if you were CEO of Enron
Corp. we wouldn't be having this chat. We
would get Enron off the dime. 
I don't think the average investor wants to
hear you singing any more about poor
accounting. And Enron's going to do just fine.
  Enron CEOs are always apologizing to 
investors, like
 you. "We have a D in accounting." 
    And then five minutes later their
chairman, the guy they paid a hundred and
twenty million bucks to, makes a move to
give himself another fifty million. 
    I mean, what's the problem?
    (g)  The issue is the guy they hired to
give them those options ain't so
in-charge-of-this-joint no more, and they
got a helluva mess. I think it would be
nice to see a little humility from those
guys. 
    (g) 
 This guy has no clue how he got
here.
    (g) 
(g) What's the difference between a
good stock and bad stock? A good stock
grows. 
(g) A bad stock, sells off. 
Well, you should ask to see
the financial statement on your stock, 
because in this case, the stock is worth
less than you paid for it. 
A lot of new investors are asking 
themselves some tough questions, and 
you're not really going to get an answer 
that you're happy with. 
    (g) 
 If you're a long-term investor, you 
want to be buying your stocks on pullbacks, 
and not too early in the morning. 
The big guy in the gray suit wants your
money in the afternoon, the middle of the
afternoon. 
He's been doing this for 40 years. And
he gets the buy signal from the guy in the
gray suit, which is a hundred times worse
than any analyst. 
    (g) 
 This fellow's probably got a bigger job 
than you have. He probably isn't working
full-time. 
But the one thing you must remember: 
You're working for him. And he doesn't
care about your portfolio.
    (g) 
 I think we can make this work. 
    (g) 
 You're starting to tell me now 
about another issue. What's the
relationship with the firm that 
puts you out here? 
    (g) 
 That's what I was getting ready to
talk to you about. What's the thing you're
most worried about? 
    (g) 
 The most worrisome thing is if
 you're working for a big firm, what are
you worried about? 
    (g) 
You have more to lose. I do. 
    (g) 
 One-hundred percent. 
    (g) 
 Now, they might not fire you, but they'll
probably 
make you miserable. But, they 
could. That's the way the system is set
up. 
And you're in the middle of
it. 
    (g) 
 But they'll make you miserable. 
They're trying to
get you to join the sales force, and you
don't want to go there. 
I'm glad you had a
conversation with your boss. 
Now you can go to lunch with him. 
Hey! He doesn't know your number. 
Let's just hope they haven't
written it down somewhere. 
    (g) 
 And this is kind of the issue 
with accounting. Accounting isn't an
exact science. 
    (g) 
You have an accountant, in the
beginning of the year, and he tries to
make his accounting close to what the
general public expects. 
But after a few years, it gets to the point
where, you've got the SEC breathing down
their neck, and they're trying to put out 
fraud alerts on these accounting changes. 
Like Enron. 
And now, we're on Enron's heels. 
And Enron's going to lose in the end.
    (g) 
 They should go to jail. 
    (g) 
 They should go to jail. 
    (g) 
(g) And there's an interesting
story about what happened with Enron.
Because when Enron fired those
accountants, they replaced them with
Arthur Anderson. 
And Arthur Anderson happened to be the
biggest auditor at that time.
    (g) 
But the guy who runs Arthur Anderson
is a man named John Riley. And he, too, is 
an ardent follower of value investing. 
And, I saw this book. It was called, 
"How to Detect Value." 
And it is full of great stories, and they
all involve the phrase "for sale by
owner." 
    (g) 
 They never met a value investor they
didn't like. That's it. 
    (g) 
If you really want to keep all this
money, it's gonna have to be in your
pockets. 
And it's got to be at risk. 
    (g) 
 How do you get a whole company out of 
your portfolio, or
 what you're really trying to do? 
    (g) 
 You always start by 
looking for companies that are out of the
mainstream. 
    (g) 
 And they don't even have to be
undervalued. There's a category of
companies, but they're undervalued in
value. 
You want to look at undervalued value
investors.
    (g) 
 Okay. I know. What's the best
indicator you could give me? 
    (g) 
 Companies where the balance sheet is 
bad, the market cap is good. 
    (g) 
 They're selling. 
    (g) 
 We have companies like this in our
portfolio. 
    (g) 
(g) You have a bunch of
companies in there, but the stock's going
up on the hopes that one of these
companies gets bought out. 
    (g) 
 At a premium. 
    (g) 
 You should come on over,
then. So, you're coming in here saying 
here's what I'm going to do. 
Tell me how you do it. 
    (g) 
 You gotta find things that are out of
the mainstream. 
    (g) 
 You got to know when to get out, or
something's gonna happen. 
    (g) 
 The fact that the stock is going up. 
    (g) 
 The fact that someone wants to buy it. 
    (g) 
 That's not your job, to find out. 
    (g) 
 We're not going to get involved with
people in the media. 
    (g) 
Well, I'm sure the guys in
the media are going to be watching. 
    (g) 
 Do you believe in value investing? 
No. 
    (g) 
 I mean, there are good value
investments. 
    (g) 
 How do you find them? 
    (g) 
 What would you do if somebody gave
you a million dollars, a hundred million
dollars, how would you invest it? 
(g) 
 When you get into these things, the
only thing you have is your eyes, and
your ears. 
    (g) 
And your ability to understand, where
are people making these kinds of
investments? 
That's what separates value investors
from people who think they're value
investors. 
    (g) 
 I've heard a lot of stories about people
that are willing to take chances. I
wonder what they're doing with their
money. 
    (g) 
 And I don't think that their investors
are going to get the returns that they
expect. And I don't think
 they're going to get the kind of return
they expect. 
    (g) 
 You don't want to do that in a 
leveraged account. You'll lose all your
money. 
    (g) 
You always get a lot of calls when a
value investor goes out of business. 
You should consider that. 
    (g) 
 I've done a lot of research. 
    (g) 
 In the 1950s, there was a fellow named 
Benjamin Graham. And his book was
"Security Analysis." 
And it had a table of all the companies
that they thought were value investments.
    (g) 
 And they were beaten down, and nobody
 wanted to buy them. I mean, he had the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:19
