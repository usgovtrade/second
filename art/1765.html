On Friday 12 January, there was a new version, but it was not in PDF.
The new one is the following one: 
http://www.mediadiver.es/uploads/espanol_english/English-Spanish-Draft-Report-FINAL-12_03_15_2016_FINAL.pdf
On the next Friday 14 January, the PDF version was published.
Since then I have not been able to get the PDF version again, I think because of the changes in the site and maybe something else.
But I really would like to have a copy of the report that I can read, print out, translate into English and use at a presentation, because I will need it after the 31 January deadline, that is when the university gives out the marks for the exam, and we don't know if we will be OK yet.
I do not have a printer at home, so the only place I can print it is the library, I usually go there after 12:30 pm but I do not have the access rights to print documents on the printer.
I already sent a request by email to the service desk of the library but got no answer. I tried to make a PDF directly from the web, but as I said, it was not PDF.
It is very urgent because I will be judged by the 31 January deadline and I will have to take my exam on the 26 February and I really need this report in English.

A:

I was finally able to download it.
I sent an email to the library and asked them for help.
An administrator then made the "print" button of that page show up.
I clicked it and then I was able to print it from there.

By the way, it did not work using Chrome in Ubuntu in the end. But it did using Firefox. I don't know why.

A:

I have also been trying to find this document from the library. When I clicked on the button that supposedly says "Print" on the bottom of the file, I couldn't download the file, but I was able to see a preview. I can't say for certain, but it appears as though it could have been a preview of the actual pdf, with some links that don't work (like Google Drive) that should work. It is probably best not to rely on this page for anything other than viewing, because as of right now (10/28/2015) that preview link appears to be broken.
I've emailed their support page.

I was able to get a copy of the report from another source, and was not asked for any personal information.

A:

This was such an interesting experience. To save the hassle of searching, here are the direct download links:

English - Spanish Draft Report FINAL 12_03_15_2016 FINAL.pdf (no preview available)
English - Spanish Draft Report FINAL 12_03_15_2016 FINAL.pdf.zip (preview available)

In summary,

Do not look for these files using the "Save" button or "Print" feature of the link posted in OP
Use the direct download links posted above or any other relevant link

There's no guarantee the links will last but in this case, these have for now.
Thanks for keeping this question/discussion alive. I wish other SE sites adopt such discussion and direct linking in answers.

Update on 26th January 2017
The direct links above are no longer working. It's back to looking for the link via Ctrl+f for "English - Spanish Draft Report FINAL 12_03_15_2016 FINAL.pdf".
After searching for a long time, I found this pdf. But the first few lines are the same, "The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW),", so I'm still a little confused as to what this is all about.
I wish the original links were up. I've saved this link.

This is the closest one to the original link.

Finally found the link and saved it.

I used the link in a different computer and here's a screen shot. 
There's also a pdf available from this pdf.
