I've noticed this behavior with other programmers as well. I find that
sometimes if the code is long enough, I forget exactly what it was supposed
to do, because I have to think about it so hard to make sure it doesn't break
the entire program. When that happens, it can make it very hard to remember
what it was meant to do, and what to fix when it breaks.

A common way to deal with that is a macro. We had a bug like that, and just
before my holiday, we had this bit of code.

#define LOOKUP(p) {\
  if (p == 0)
    return -1;\
  else if (p->data > 1) {\
    if (p->parent == 0) \
      return 0;\
    else if (p->parent->parent == 0)
      return 0;\
    return -1;
  } else if (p->data < 1) {\
    if (p->parent == 0) \
      return 0;\
    else if (p->parent->parent == 0) \
      return 0;\
    return 1; \
  } else {\
    if (p->parent->child[p->data] == 0) \
      return -1;\
    else if (p->parent->child[p->data] != p) \
      return -1;\
    else if (p->data < 2) \
      return -1;\
    else \
      return p->parent->child[p->data];\
  }\
  }

It's a function that takes a tree structure and returns the value of a node,
but without any memory or state. I can't remember the logic we came up with to
make it work. It's still in use today, and is just two lines long.

Aren't there really many situations when one is supposed to not have
functionality in code to make it run faster?

I remember some of the stuff I saw in the early nineties in some of my courses
which was about programming in non blocking i/o, interrupt handling, task
switching, ...

"The thing is, it's possible to optimize anything without optimization
knowledge."

Yes, indeed. But that hardly constitutes "a principle worth spending time
learning", or even "a real problem".

If your language of choice can't handle the task at hand with the current
set_of_instructions then you should do one of the following:

1\. Add a new opcode 2\. Add an instruction set for the problem at hand 3\. Use
a completely different language (C,Perl,VimL,Csh)

There should be a better way to write a program that speeds up running time.
All compilers need to support "if x" statements. Sometimes they can turn a 2
bit condition into two 1 bit conditionals. These are super cheap and can save
you a million or so cycles.

This is a good article, if you are looking for faster implementation of
something, but I am not sure if it is good for writing your own programming
language.

I was also thinking about this last year, in particular, while reviewing some
newly-introduced features in Python 3.3, which allow one to add annotations
into Python source code for optimisation purposes. Here is a short demo of
this feature:

    
    
        import dis
        import time
    
        @timeit  # timeit is a decorator added by functools.py
        def f(x):
            return 1/x if x else None  # the None part is optional
        f(1e15)
    

This will print:

    
    
        <timeit.Timer object at 0x0280E660>
    

Note the time taken:

    
    
        >>> f(1e15)
        7.169901162408e-06
    

If you are just looking for faster code, you should be looking into other
solutions, and not some fancy-sounding thingy which is going to be hard to
use.

The best programming language for the compiler is the language you know well.
I know that C programmers would prefer a C compiler. But is a C compiler also
the best choice for a team that writes in Python? What about a team that is
well-versed in C and Java?

If I'm designing a programming language, I'm considering not only how it will
run on the current CPUs of the market, but also how it will run on other
platforms, and possibly not just in the near future but possibly even further
in the future. A language can be designed so that it will run fast for any
problem set, or it can be designed so that it is capable of optimization.
Furthermore, a language can be designed so that its compiler will always be
able to do optimizations on the fly without the programmer needing to modify
the source code at all (for example, a language that does constant folding
might be designed so that you can say this:

    
    
        A* a = new A(100);
    
        a->baz() = new Baz();
        a->baz()->baz()->baz();
    

And the compiler will replace the A* a, the baz() method call, and the baz()
method call at the end with "new Baz()" and never notice anything amiss. This
is the whole reason I wanted to do this project: automatic optimization and
elimination of unnecessary bookkeeping. A language that does this will require
the programmer to think much more carefully about exactly what he wants his
program to do, but will allow him to program more quickly. If a lot of people
write code in a language like this, they will all share their optimizations
and we will have a better language in the future.

So with these thoughts in mind, how should we do this? I think we need to be
a little more lenient with the language syntax to enable automatic
optimization and to allow common idioms. The classic example is that you have
to explicitly name every local variable if you want the compiler to do
register allocation for you, but people don't always write to local variables
in the obvious places. In a language like Ruby, people tend to write loops as

    
    
        (0..n).each { |i| do_something(i) }
    

And since no local variable is declared, the compiler has no way of knowing
that every iteration of the loop can run on its own stack, so the loop will
be run in a stack frame for every iteration. If you want it to be stack-
allocated like this, you have to explicitly say so:

    
    
        (0..n).each { |i| do_something(i) } { |i| break i }
    

Now when the loop is not stack-allocated, the compiler can optimize it better.
The same happens with many other languages, but Python is more rigid about
variable naming. In some languages you can declare a local variable on the
spot by using a wildcard:

    
    
        List<String>* arr = new List<String>();
    

In Python, you have to declare the variable:

    
    
        arr = [string]
    

This is a little painful if you want to pass the variable to a function as an
argument or pass it around. I think the best approach is to use the "C-*" form
which allows you to define a variable at an arbitrary place in the namespace
using these notations:

    
    
        arr = [] (for, while, do...while)
    

A C-* name must start with one of a sequence of special characters, so this
means you could do something like

    
    
        >>> for i in range(10):
        ...   arr.foo = i
    

You could also say

    
    
        for i in range(10):
            obj = {}
            obj.foo = i
            arr.bar = obj
    

This would not normally cause a name conflict with arr, because this sort of
variable has no name at all. You could have thousands of definitions like
this, and they wouldn't clobber each other, but it would be safe to have
multiple definitions for the same name if you explicitly assigned the name to
it. I would expect Python's bytecode compiler to be able to eliminate as many
of these non-conflicting variables as it can.

So that's the C-* form. You can define</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:49
