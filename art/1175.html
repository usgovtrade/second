To my knowledge, “Witches Coven” will be the first female only action movie produced by a major movie studio that will get a wide release. “Witches Coven” represents not only a turning point in the history of Hollywood film but also in the history of media and marketing. This will prove that you can make money on what audiences want.

“Witches Coven” was released nationwide on Friday, October 27th. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the movie is being released only on Amazon Prime (where it is not the top movie in their “Most Wanted” section at the moment, however I don’t know how much longer it will remain there). It is available to watch online for free (and download or DVR it) HERE (click “Get It” at the top left, go to “All Movies & TV” and you will find “Witches Coven” in the Movies section).

If you can’t wait until October 27th and you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, you may try seeing the movie as part of a “group theater watching party” at The Midnight Movie Club on Saturday, October 21st. More info HERE. The event is a benefit for Women’s Cancer Research, and the admission ticket includes a FREE bottle of wine with the $9 admission (there are two free bottles of wine given away; the other is for the movie screening). This is being presented by local film critic / writer and filmmaker John Waters (who wrote the feature film “Role Models” that had a segment of a TV show he created shown in “Witches Coven”), filmmaker / journalist and author of books about women in horror movies, Mara Wilson (who is the co-creator of the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” books and featured in the film “The Lizzie Borden Chronicles”) and the owners of The Midnight Movie Club, Tom O’Farrell and Michael Bonner. Admission is $10, but after that you will have free popcorn and candy!

In the San Francisco Bay Area, “Witches Coven” will play in:

San Francisco at the Parkway Speakeasy on Thursday, October 26th and Friday, October 27th at 7:30 pm; in Berkeley on Wednesday, October 18th and Thursday, October 19th at 7:30 pm; in Davis on Thursday, October 19th and Friday, October 20th at 7:30 pm; in Oakland on Monday, October 23rd and Tuesday, October 24th at 7:30 pm; in Palo Alto on Saturday, October 21st at 7:00 pm; and in San Jose on Saturday, October 21st at 8:00 pm. In Berkeley, tickets are $10 in advance ($12 at the door). In Davis, tickets are $15 in advance ($20 at the door). In Oakland, tickets are $18. In Palo Alto, tickets are $15 in advance ($20 at the door). In San Jose, tickets are $20 in advance ($25 at the door). You can purchase tickets online HERE and at participating theater box offices.

On October 20th, I will be attending the premiere of “Witches Coven” at the AMC Metreon in San Francisco and will be covering the screening.

There will be a celebration after the movie screening, in which I will be DJing the soundtrack for “Witches Coven”, a compilation of songs that are an integral part of my film (some songs from my film have been on the Billboard Hot 100 Charts). This film is important to me because this is a place I can celebrate women in action films, but the songs in this film are also an integral part of my life and who I am as a person.

Thank you for your interest in this project, and I hope you’ll see it and enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.

The first trailer for “Witches Coven” is out and the movie is now set to hit theaters in October.

The first movie is a “Hollywood Western” with a female lead (which is no surprise – Hollywood is currently producing more female-driven films than ever). However, “Witches Coven” is not a normal western. It’s much darker than your average Hollywood movie.

“Witches Coven” is a story of love in the Wild West, but it’s the love between a group of witches and the town of Witch Coven, a town inhabited by settlers. Many of the town’s residents are inhuman men (the ones you see in the trailer). A local saloon owner has captured an unruly girl named Alice, put her in a stock, and left her out in the middle of nowhere. Alice comes into the middle of a confrontation between bounty hunter Samantha and bounty hunter Naila, an evil couple (who have previously killed, in a sadistic way, two women who got in their way). The two witches do not share the same ideology of killing human beings and decide to use Alice as a pawn to get closer to the bounty hunters.

The movie is not only dark and gritty, but it is also darkly funny. The story seems like it would appeal to anyone who loved “The Handmaid’s Tale”, “X-Men” and even “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory”.

Check out the first trailer here:

This trailer was released by Lionsgate, which is producing the film, to promote another release that was just released – “Vampire Academy”. However, the “Vampire Academy” trailer has a similar tone to “Witches Coven”. Therefore, the “Witches Coven” trailer has very little to do with what you see in the movie. Also, there are many things in the “Vampire Academy” trailer that are not in the movie. I was a big fan of the original “Vampire Academy” novel (now a movie), but you should know that there is much more in the book than what you see in the trailer. For example, the novel is told from the perspective of one of the students. There are a lot of action sequences in the book that did not make it into the original movie, and I expect that many of those sequences are included in the upcoming film’s sequel, “Vampire Academy 2: Blood Sisters.”

I do want to add something to the trailer. At 0:30, you hear a voice say, “That’s one of those movie trailers. Where’s the action?” That person is one of the town’s inhabitants (one of those human beings that was mentioned in the paragraph above. This is the first time I am aware of a cinematic event in which the “action” is an actual movie scene. This is important, because that scene does not feature much “action” in a traditional sense. This is an action sequence and a character introduction.

The movie’s director / producer, Ginger Linnen (who also created the “Mummy 3D” movie, which many of you may have seen), has stated that it is her intention to create a movie that combines “cinema verite” style “action” (in the style of the “Bourne Identity”) with a “dark comedy.” Linnen also stated that “Vampire Academy” is a movie she will not want to make again. However, she still plans to make a sequel to “Vampire Academy 2: Blood Sisters” as well as a second “Vampire Academy” movie.

Here are a few additional notes and details about “Witches Coven”:

As I was editing the trailer for “Witches Coven,” I actually cut out a lot of the music. It was because of the movie’s original music score that I realized the film is very romantic, and I wanted to keep that up throughout.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:33
