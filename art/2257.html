It would be nice to see benchmarks. The author is comparing SQLite to "other
SQL databases" (PostgreSQL and MySQL) but does not provide any comparisons
with SQLite's own non-relational DBMS.

I'm wondering why SQLite doesn't use SQL's GROUP BY, rather than the string
join based method.

From a quick look at sqlite_master, you can see why.

For example, to select all unique customer rows:

select customer_id, count(*) from customers group by customer_id;

(note this does allow duplicate counts for a given customer, but I'm guessing
that's the most important part of the 'group by')

A quick comparison shows that there are (from my limited sampling) over 20
unique customer_id values in the system.

For some smaller databases I might expect that a string join based query might
be faster (probably only by a few percents, but 20% is significant when
concerned about database tuning).

However, as tables grow, it will probably be more efficient to use normal
aggregate functions (e.g. aggregate on a group of sales transactions).

How does one use a query like this with sqlite? I would expect it to be very
slow.

SQLite already implements DISTINCT, so the only real benefit of this function
is to group by on a column of another table, which is a very specialized case.

~~~

DISTINCT was added in SQLite3 3.5.0

I'd love to hear the benchmarks for SQLite's query planner. I've read that it
is really fast and that it out performs other SQL databases at querying. The
query planner is the one part that makes writing an object relational mapper
for SQLite like ActiveRecord in Rails possible (it uses SQLite's query planner
to generate a query plan), so if you're writing an ORM for SQLite or any other
relational database you should be extremely interested in this topic.

<http://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html>

~~~
thomaspaine
If the query planner is really so great, why do you think you need SQLite's
query planner for ActiveRecord? I think the reason for that is because of
SQLite's query planner.

How much space does it need for the "normal" (relational) tables?

~~~
jbert
It's quite trivial to construct a database with just simple rows (i.e. just a
file as large as the data), so for smallish data sets (say 100k rows), you'd
use something like 5MB.

That file can grow quite big though, for example a 1GB sqlite database has ~2
billion rows.

Postgres' query planner is really fast, too.

------
Hexstream
Doesn't MySQL use a similar mechanism?

~~~
babo
That's the general idea. I've heard some time ago that modern Linux kernel
also has an improved query plan.

------
TweedHeads
"A more modern SQL language, with a complete query optimizer that works
correctly and efficiently, with a straightforward language syntax."

More like "SQLite needs a bit of a makeover, but is still quite a nice piece
of software"

TweedHeads
"Modern" SQL

It was created in 1991.

What a surprise, it didn't change much since then.

~~~
Zak
This is a bit harsh. It doesn't change much in large part because it has a
very fast execution engine. A common complaint about other RDBMS is that their
query engines aren't that good. Maybe I'm not familiar with others' complaints,
but I find SQLite's pretty impressive in that regard.

~~~
TweedHeads
The syntax is too verbose for my taste. Why do they have tables and columns?
It should be much easier to express what you want without all that nonsense.

I do agree that SQLite is very fast but it isn't really much faster than
MySQL, Postgres, Oracle or SQL Server.

But they don't care about the complaints so the best thing to do is to tell
them to change the syntax.

I like SQLite, I think it is a great programmig tool because it has an SQL
interface with which to query databases. The problem is you are limited in the
size of the database you can use with it. If you were limited to 2 gigs, then
it would be great. but when you can have 20 gigs, then why use it? I tried and
couldn't come up with a good answer.

With that said, the syntax isn't so bad. Its actually a very easy to learn and
use query interface. I personally don't like it so much because I don't like
that it is a relational database.

~~~
babo
SQLite's relational interface is not its main value. Its most valuable feature
is that it implements a SQL-92 compliant database engine and the engine
actually works like that. This allows developing new modules and extensions on
the database backend without loosing support for SQL92. The fact that it is a
relational interface is just a side-effect.
