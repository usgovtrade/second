North Korea routinely puts its people in prison camps for minor crimes like watching South Korean movies or listening to foreign music. Women and girls are forced to undergo the barbaric procedure of Female Genital Mutilation. North Korea's gulag has an estimated 50,000 political prisoners, most of whom have been sent to the camp system for less serious crimes than the punishment of hard labor. Hundreds of thousands more are imprisoned for alleged anti-state activities (see also: Crimes against Humanity, Repression of Human Rights). In North Korea, there are approximately 200,000 to 300,000 people held in the prison camps. These camps are called kwanliso () in North Korea and are also known as gulags by the rest of the world. Most inmates in North Korea are held in the political prison camps or reform through labor camps. In July 2017, a report estimated that approximately 70,000 political prisoners may have been in North Korean prisons. According to a report by The Guardian, there is speculation that thousands may have been killed in North Korean prison camps since 2012.

Forced abortions and illegal abortions. Women in North Korea have little rights when it comes to their bodies, and the government can force them to abort their child for any reason. The government frequently uses illegal abortions as a method to prevent the birth of another generation of people who will stand in the way of North Korean ideology. While most of the political prisons are filled with political offenders, an estimated 100,000 of them are held in labor camps. In these camps the work can be difficult. The women in labor camps are sent out to do difficult labor, working very hard in the fields. Women are not given food when they don't bring in the harvests, so most prisoners are starving when they are sent to the labor camps.

Women in North Korea are forbidden from taking their husband's last name if they get married for multiple reasons:

This restriction on marriage is also in place to prevent women from stealing their husband's identity. This is the main reason why women in North Korea can only take their husband's surname if they adopt his family name as the first name. This restriction on marriage is also in place to prevent women from stealing their husband's identity. Women's passports are marked with a red stamp that denotes they are unwed mothers, whether or not that is true.

This issue is also linked to the government's propaganda. Women in North Korea are forced to marry by age 25. This is because they are expected to give birth to at least one child by this age, and since children usually aren't born right away, the government wants them to quickly get married. Those who don't follow this order of affairs are usually sent to prison.

To put a woman at ease, a man's first wife is generally not allowed to speak with other women in the house.

This way, the children of the first wife will be recognized as the first born, thereby making it easier for her husband to take advantage of his young wife. This method has been adopted from the Joseon dynasty in Korea.

The practice also enables men to have affairs with mistresses without making their wives suspicious.

There are few laws and no rights on abortion in North Korea. Therefore, abortion is illegal. But, if the mother is injured during pregnancy, abortion is allowed. In fact, during the year 2006, some North Korean hospitals didn't report any abortions.

It is very common for women in North Korea to work until they go into labor. Women are sent into labor if they have worked too long or have gotten sick. When a woman goes into labor, she is taken to a hospital, where she stays overnight. Once the baby is born, she is sent back to her original workplace. A woman in labor will usually get one day off per week, but she cannot be absent from work. The government prefers that she works until her baby is one year old, and in some cases, even older.
