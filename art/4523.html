As many as 75% of all mediastinal tumors are benign. This fact is particularly relevant in surgery and anesthesia because diagnostic procedures and treatment require less aggressive operative and anesthetic management. Surgical biopsy is the gold standard for histological diagnosis and staging. Malignancy is suspected when there is rapid growth, invasion of adjacent structures, or invasion of the great vessels. Surgery remains the treatment of choice. The extent of surgical removal varies from complete resection to biopsy only. A multidisciplinary approach to patients who have tumors of the mediastinum is essential. The approach depends upon the clinical presentation and the imaging findings, which dictate the appropriate therapy. Treatment of benign mediastinal tumors usually requires local procedures only. Because of the difficulty in obtaining histological diagnosis and the risk of tumor spillage, the general treatment of malignant mediastinal tumors is an operation whenever possible. In general, a minimally invasive approach is favored. In a multidisciplinary approach, oncology, cardiac surgery and anesthesiology are central in helping patients with tumors in this area. In some cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also be appropriate in the preoperative or postoperative phase. A multidisciplinary team approach to patients with tumors in the mediastinum is essential for planning effective treatment. The management of patients with tumors of the mediastinum requires interdisciplinary cooperation between multiple specialties. Our interdisciplinary team is in charge of many different problems in various parts of the mediastinum. Our approach combines surgical and nonsurgical procedures and depends on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and the overall medical condition of the patient. The most important aspect of the management of patients with tumors in the mediastinum is careful evaluation by an interdisciplinary team.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:36
