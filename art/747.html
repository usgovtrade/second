will run you down with my truck."    Lana slammed the 
truck's door and pointed to the ground. I 
climbed back in, not knowing what was going 
to happen.   Lana started the truck.   She 
put it in reverse, hit the gas, and took off 
screaming. . . toward the house. The kids 
were screaming for me to stop her. A truck 
always knows what a trucker has on the 
other end.   I couldn't let her take off and 
hurt them.

   I stepped out of the pickup, pulled my revolver, 
and took aim.   My wife was walking toward me 
with a knife in her hand, and I could see the 
terror in her eyes.   She stood there with tears 
in her eyes and raised her hand as if to stop me, 
then plunged the knife deep into her chest. 

   The kids were still screaming. I heard them 
saying, "No . . . no . . . . no . . .." I was scared 
that they were going to witness her death. 

   As I came closer to her, I saw that she had put 
her hands on the side of the truck to steady 
herself.  When she plunged the knife into her 
heart, I heard a gurgling sound and saw a blood-
like gas fuild in the air, then she was dead.  I 
felt a strange sensation, as though I was just 
watching it all from another room, seeing what 
had happened. 

   My whole family was gathered around me. 
The kids were crying and holding my hand.   It 
seemed that I was inside some kind of tunnel 
filled with people trying to pull me out.  I 
suddenly heard the voice of my father and it 
was very clear and loud. 
  `Don't be afraid. Do your duty.'   

  I opened the door of the pickup and lifted 
Lana out. I asked her where she was going.   
She said she was going to her mother's, and she 
wanted to go with her children and take her 
mother back with us. I begged her not to go 
back, telling her there was nothing for her, and 
that the kids needed a father and a mother.  

  At that moment, I became aware that I was 
trembling like a leaf.   I was covered in a cold 
sweat and started to shiver. I felt weak and I 
had a strange sensation, as though I was not 
me.   I started hearing very loud sounds 
coming from very close and very far away at the 
same time, sounds like firecrackers, glass 
breaking, and people laughing and screaming. 
But I could not hear the screams and shouts 
of the children or Lana. I lost all feeling in 
my body.   I fell to my knees and started to 
scream and cry.

I was in a state of shock. I was covered in a 
cold sweat. I felt weak. I had a strange 
sensation, as though I was not myself.

 I had not felt anything like this before.    I 
started hearing very loud sounds coming from 
very close and very far away at the same time, 
sounds like firecrackers, glass breaking, and 
people laughing and screaming. But I could 
not hear the screams and shouts of the children 
or Lana. I felt empty and lost, as though I had 
been completely drained of all feeling.   I 
fell to my knees and started to scream and cry.


I remember the feeling of someone being with 
me but I could not see his face.  I was looking 
at a wall of flames.  I started to cry.  
"It's not worth it . . ."  I cried to myself.  " 
She is dead, and I am all alone."   "   
She's gone . . .  you better get out . . . 
You are better off without her . . .  
. . . it's all over for you . . .  
So what if you lose the kids ?  
. . . it's better if you just forget her . . . 

"  You're better off alone . . .  
When you walk away, she's gone . . . 
You are better off without her . . . 
Don't be afraid. Do your duty . . .  
You are not alone . . .  
Don't ever let her come between you and your 
children."    

-  

`You're better off alone. 
When you walk away, she's gone . . . 
You are better off without her . . .  
Don't be afraid. Do your duty . . .  
You are not alone . . .  
Don't ever let her come between you and your 
children. `

I opened the door of the pickup and pulled 
her over to it. I grabbed her by the legs, 
like I was carrying a little girl, and I took her 
home with me.

-  

The kids were running toward me to see what I 
was doing. My wife's body fell in on top of me. 

 My kids and I started to scream. We heard 
the voice of my father very loud. He was 
asking me to take care of my children, and that 
I had to do my duty. 
-  

We all ran to the truck, leaving the burned 
house behind.

My father was standing in front of me. 
`You did well, my son. You are free . . . 
 ' 

 It was dark, and I couldn't see his face. 
` . . . now, go. You're free. You're 
free . . . 

. . . your mother is gone, but you can 
still live your life. 
You can start a new life . . .'

My father had saved my life.
I had learned the most important lesson of 
my life. My father's voice had made me 
realize that I was still alive, and I was not 
alone. I had been given a new chance.  
- 

 `You're free, my son. You're free . . . 
. . . You should go and take your 
mother's spirit with you.'

 I could hear the sound of sirens. It was 
the same sound as the sirens at the time of 
the accident when my mother was killed. 
I looked at my children and I told them, ` 
The voice that you heard was your father's 
voice. He is with you . . . . 
He's waiting for you . . . . 

He wants you to take your mother's spirit 
with you.'

I got in the truck and picked up my wife's body. 
The kids were standing on the back bumper, and 
I was crying. My whole family was gathering 
around me and we started to drive to my mother 
and father's house.  I wanted to see my mother.
My father's voice made me feel calm, and my 
mother's spirit was in my heart, I could hear 
her voice saying, `You are alive. You are not 
alone.' 
 
I felt the sound of my father in my ears, 
telling me that I did not have to be afraid.  
I felt the sound of my father telling me that I 
should be strong. 
 
The next day, as I was eating dinner with my 
son, my wife's sister was also visiting, and she 
was amazed that I was alive.  
-  

At the time of my accident, the hospital said I 
was dead. When they brought me in, they 
thought I was just a piece of meat.  
They took me to the morgue to test me, 
and they ran all the machines over me, but 
nobody survived them.

They had seen my face, and they knew I was 
not a breathing body.
 
The firemen, the police, and the hospital 
all looked at me, and they were all very 
surprised to see me alive. 

 -

My mother's spirit was with me all along. I 
carried her in my heart.   `Don't be afraid, son.
Do your duty. Go home. Get some rest, and
