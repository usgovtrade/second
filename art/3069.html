The Big Bad Wolf, the evil antagonist in the classic fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood, has broken out of the confines of storybook and into the world of Hollywood movie making. But now, he’s out for vengeance. This time he’s after the town of Timber Hills in the remote areas of Canada. Little Red Riding Hood is trapped in a world of mayhem as Big Bad Wolf continues to grow bolder, becoming more violent and bloodthirsty with each new villain.

When people have no defence against him, they start becoming more aggressive and ruthless in their attempts to take him down. A wolf of this caliber could ruin lives and wreak havoc on an entire community if allowed to live freely.

It’s Little Red Riding Hood’s duty to stop the wolves from continuing to make their way through the forest and threatening everyone and everything they encounter. But, when she falls under the protection of a little boy named Charlie, can she help them defeat the villainous beast or will they end up on the losing end of another epic battle?

A Fable: The Big Bad Wolf is a short film from the perspective of the Big Bad Wolf himself and explores the role of a villain in fairy tales.

In the beginning, he discovers that he is in an evil world where the heroes are evil and the people are happy and good-looking. The people have no idea that he is the biggest villain that has ever lived. He has created so much destruction and done so much bad stuff in his evil quest to gain power and his revenge. This is the tale of his adventure to find a way out of his torment and find his way into the stories and lives of children everywhere. He wants to share his side of the story and maybe teach kids how to not be bullies, but how to be heroes in their own fairy tale.

When Little Red Riding Hood steps into his house to beg the little black-eyed boy to protect her, the wolf sees her as the perfect, innocent victim. With the power of the wolf's teeth, he's going to capture Little Red Riding Hood and use her as a plaything in front of his whole pride. But when the two of them get a taste of their own medicine, will Little Red Riding Hood find love, not hate, in the depths of the abyss?</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:08
