**"People are already online":** Jocelyn Noveck, a New York University cyberlaw expert who directs the school's Center for Civic Media, pointed out that "We had never had a debate about whether [internet sites] were protected or not before" the Sony Pictures incident. "Before, the question was 'Should this kind of information be protected at all?'—not 'What are the rights and the responsibilities of a corporation with access to this information?' "

**"That's the difference":** The ACLU's Dane Clark agreed, noting that "the [Supreme] Court was saying [the Sony hackers] do not have the right to access this information." "People who run companies are now taking action to get ahead of the curve. It's a lot harder to respond when a hacker doesn't have access to those systems and emails than when your information is on an open server. That's where the pressure is building from the business community." "These breaches are here to stay," added Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based watchdog group. "It is just too easy for someone to illegally access a computer system." **"The laws around electronic records . . . don't adequately account for a technology that has become more and more prevalent":** _United States of America v. Dmitry Dokuchaev, et al._ , Criminal No. 14–88, ECF No. 3 (U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, 13 Mar. 2015), pp. 1, 16–17. "The law is in flux in terms of what kind of records are going to be protected and who should be charged with protection," Dokuchaev's lawyer, Edward MacMahon, said. He added that many internet users do not understand that the email content they send "is not protected and can be used against you by hackers. It's very easy for hackers to have your computer hack your email system."
