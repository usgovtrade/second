FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the conventional LED package 1 with a flip chip structure. As shown in FIG. 1, the LED package 1 comprises a carrier 11, a metal layer 13, a reflective layer 15, and a chip 17, wherein the chip 17 comprises a light-emitting unit (not labeled) and a plurality of electrodes 191. The light-emitting unit and the electrodes 191 of the chip 17 are electrically connected to the metal layer 13 through the reflective layer 15.
In addition, the chip 17 is flip-chip bonded on the carrier 11 with each of the electrodes 191 of the chip 17 connected to a respective pad portion 121 of the carrier 11 by a plurality of conductive bumps 191 such that the conductive bumps 191 penetrate the reflective layer 15. In addition, the surface of the carrier 11 is plated with silver, so as to enhance the reflectivity thereof.
However, the light-emitting unit of the chip 17 is disposed in a low-reflectivity region 123 of the carrier 11. Accordingly, due to the fact that the light generated by the chip 17 would be reflected by the surface of the carrier 11 instead of being emitted from the surface of the chip 17, it is impossible to obtain an optical bonding effect between the light-emitting unit of the chip 17 and the surface of the carrier 11, such that the light generated by the chip 17 is blocked. As a result, light extraction efficiency of the chip 17 may be greatly lowered and thereby leads to a poor light-emitting efficiency of the LED package 1.
Therefore, there is a need of providing an LED package with high light-emitting efficiency to solve the drawbacks of the conventional LED package with poor light-emitting efficiency.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:05
