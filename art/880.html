technology to the most simple.  We are implementing an effective enterprise 
solution in six months that provides customers real value that can be 
utilized by the new breed of energy professionals.  Our target customers are 
the mid-market companies and executives who are involved in the design and 
construction processes, but we have taken great pains to ensure that our 
technology and product is simple to deploy.  A customer need only worry 
about &how to get started8 and not &how to get there.8

Our real product is extremely simple.  It enables a customer to purchase our 
capacity with a single phone call.  Our customers then call a credit contact 
who immediately provision the required capacity into the customer,s account 
with a single phone call.  Our customers can then call us and immediately 
have that same capacity withdrawn from the market and shipped to their 
bidding specification.  Even for those unskilled in the technicalities of 
energy, it is clear that we offer enormous benefits.

The FERC hearing has been an important ingredient of our success to this 
point. Their curiosity about the innovative tools and technologies has 
enabled the market to respond with incredible alacrity. The 
communication/public relations strategy has been a clear success to this 
point.

The recent news coverage has focused on FERC,s intent to lower the existing 
capacities in the market to 1,000. This is a good first step, but we believe 
the final determination by the Commission must allow for an opportunity for 
all of the existing generators to provide testimony as to why the CAPACITY 
should not be lowered. The alternative is to use the least efficient 
generators as the basis for the determination. The least efficient generators 
may not be the proper standard as applied to these types of contracts. In 
addition, the market today has no precedent for how prices will be set for 
these contracts. The Commission should consider the testimony of market 
participants prior to lowering the maximum capacity.

Solving this problem will require a steady and incremental pace by all 
concerned. If market participants have a clear understanding of the proposal, 
then our job is made much easier. We are now engaging in a concerted effort 
to communicate our story to all of the major market participants. Our success 
will be greatly enhanced if the key industry leaders become involved. 
Meetings with Calpine, Strategic Energy, CMS Energy and Williams have been 
productive and we look forward to continuing to communicate the benefits of 
the program. We are encouraged that SCE and PG&E have agreed to work with us 
as a long-term solution. We have engaged with NRG, Duke, Constellation, 
Southern, Reliant, and El Paso. There is a common theme being expressed. 
Please continue to use the energy and enthusiasm that you have expressed in 
these meetings to further communicate the benefits that this offering will 
bring to the marketplace.

The Commission has emphasized the fact that these rates are only for a six 
month period. To ensure that this critical path is protected, our first 
priority will be to identify a date certain by which we need all contracts in 
place. 

We are working to create as favorable an environment as possible to 
effectively implement this transaction. If we do not receive the necessary 
contracts from the market, we will have to decline to offer this program 
going forward. We will have very little time to wait to offer this program 
once the FERC order is issued, so it is essential that we have positive 
contracts in place prior to the issuance of the order. We need the 
contracts*and the industry needs the prices. 

We have already made significant progress and are now in the final phase of 
contract negotiations. It is our goal to sign a contract by July 20. Because 
the supply is limited and the program is extremely popular, the request for 
voluntary contracts exceeds the supply. We are concerned that if the program 
is canceled, then supply will quickly be returned to the pre-program levels.

With this in mind, we must ask you to help communicate the benefits of the 
program. We must also ask you to return this favor once the contracts are 
negotiated. Since the demand is increasing rapidly, it is possible that more 
customers will want to offer short-term contracts once the program is 
launched. If demand does increase significantly, then the Commission may have 
no choice but to extend the $150 offers indefinitely until the market can be 
satisfied. This will be important to the future success of our efforts and 
this program. 
Ensuring that the market can effectively provide this critical capacity in a 
timely fashion is essential to our success. Let,s work together to help 
ensure that the Commission,s decision to suspend the rate methodology for the 
new supplies goes smoothly. We must not forget that the goal of the 
transmission providers is to make money. The transmission providers will be 
pleased with our participation. 

Thank you for your support and effort to bring the most efficient and 
effective supply response program to the market. Together, we will continue 
to work to make this market work and continue to support the goals of FERC. 

Sincerely,
