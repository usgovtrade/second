The invention further relates to the application of said compounds and compositions to the protection of any object susceptible to fungal and/or bacterial growth or contamination.
Throughout this application, various publications are referred to in parentheses. Full citations for these references may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties into the subject application to more fully describe the art to which the subject invention pertains.
The control of microorganisms is essential in achieving the desired growth and preservation of plant material. Although a variety of methods have been devised to improve the state of microbiological contamination of plant material such as fruits and vegetables, there is always a demand for new compositions which are more effective. It is now well known that such compositions can be more efficacious when combined with other substances such as antimicrobial agents. Several prior art patents (e.g. US Pat. Nos. 4,517,373 and 4,792,692) which discuss plant treating compositions are directed to so-called “phytochemicals” which are combinations of compounds that have specific biological activities. Each of the prior art compositions and patents identified above, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, specifically define a group of substances which can be included in the claimed invention. These compositions require the use of combinations of specific phytochemicals, where each component must be added in a precise concentration to achieve a beneficial result. A particular example of one composition of this type is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,592,940, relating to compositions for stimulating growth of plants and, more particularly, tomatoes, which include a mixture of plant growth substances having two components: the first being a mixture of plant growth substances containing indoleacetic acid (IAA), a cytokinin and, optionally, gibberellic acid (GA3); and the second being a mixture of isopropyl-N-phenylcarbamate, which is also known as 2-phenylpropanoic acid (isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate) and a plant growth substance selected from the group consisting of gibberellic acid, kinetin, benzyladenine, benzylaminopurine and benzyladenosine-5′-triphosphate. Each component must be added at a precise concentration to achieve the desired result.
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a composition suitable for the protection of plants from damage due to microbial infestation.
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a composition that is especially efficacious in inhibiting bacterial and fungal development.
It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a composition for application to an object susceptible to microbial growth and/or contamination, which object is more efficacious than commercially available compositions.
The present invention is directed to a composition suitable for use as a plant treating agent, wherein the composition is suitable for the control of undesirable microorganisms. The invention is also directed to a composition which can be mixed with other substances to form a mixture suitable for treating plants, wherein the mixture is especially effective in inhibiting undesirable microorganisms. The invention further relates to the application of said compositions to objects susceptible to microbial growth.
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a treating composition suitable for protecting plants from microbial growth comprising a mixture of at least a first fungicidal compound and a second chemical agent selected from the group consisting of compounds useful in inhibiting enzymatic activity, the group further including: fungicides such as nikkomycin, sodium bicarbonate, sodium metasilicate and magnesium sulfate; bactericides such as formaldehyde, sodium borate, potassium permanganate, sodium chloride, sodium nitrite and sodium sulfate; other antimicrobials such as iodoform and iodophor; and compounds such as boric acid, bicarbonate, silicofluorides, sodium borate and trisodium phosphate.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a treating composition suitable for protecting plants from microbial growth comprising a mixture of at least a first fungicidal compound and a second chemical agent selected from the group consisting of compounds useful in inhibiting enzymatic activity, the group further including: fungicides such as nikkomycin, sodium bicarbonate, sodium metasilicate and magnesium sulfate; bactericides such as formaldehyde, sodium borate, potassium permanganate, sodium chloride, sodium nitrite and sodium sulfate; other antimicrobials such as iodoform and iodophor; and compounds such as boric acid, bicarbonate, silicofluorides, sodium borate and trisodium phosphate.
In a further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a composition comprising:
(a) at least one chemical compound selected from the group consisting of a fungicidal agent and a bactericide, the at least one chemical agent being in an effective amount</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:27
