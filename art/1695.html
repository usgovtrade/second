Three of his other songs were written for documentaries: the theme to The Staircase, "The Lost Battalion", and "The House at the End of Hope Street".

Foster stated that "For years, I had a series of song-ideas that never really found their way into lyrics or songs. As they had been around for a long time, I felt that I was never going to make them. Then, one day last year in New York, I recorded them as a kind of tribute." For the release of The Lost Battalion song, Foster also wrote a new song with The National's Aaron Dessner titled "Where Did You Go". This is the first song he has ever co-written and was played live by the band at Radio City Music Hall with special guests.

The first single from the album, "The Cold Wind Blows", features "Bells", a poem written by Foster's mother, and was described as "a love song to a childhood place" in Pitchfork.

A documentary about singer John Legend and his then wife Ciara, Love & Politics, is based on Foster's Love & Disappear, and is also called Love & Disappear.

Critical reception

The album received highly positive reviews from critics and has a score of 84 out of 100 on Metacritic. Mojo described it as Foster's "most intimate album yet, featuring piano and guitar, string arrangements and a hushed air of tragedy... The result is an album of astonishing intimacy: a reflection of the power of words on a track that will haunt you." The Independent described the album as "a record of such devastating beauty that it should probably be labelled as a therapeutic remedy" and went on to call it "a heartbreaking work, an elegy for childhood love and loss, for the end of life as you know it." The Quietus wrote "The songs are intimate and delicate, with an attention to detail that is unusual for someone of his stature, and a softness that can only come from such a deep pool of sadness, without any cynicism or irony," while comparing the album with Philip Glass's Koyaanisqatsi.

Upon the release of the album, it appeared on the lists of the Best Albums of the Year by Pitchfork and The Guardian, and on the Best Albums of 2017 lists of NPR, NME and PopMatters.
