Later career

She was a regular on The Last Leg on Channel 4.

In 2007, she filmed a solo sex comedy for television called, Sex Drive. Sex Drive is a TV show made by a film company about a London PR who gets a driving licence.

In 2008, she started touring with a brand new show "Dame Edna: The Female Impersonator" in the UK and Ireland. This was her first ever all female show. She performed this show at Edinburgh Festival, Brighton, London, The Palace Theatre, Oxford and Wembley Arena, amongst others.
