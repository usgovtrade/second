Dewitt & Duvail, A Comparison of Fast and Slow FEC Schemes, "FEC2000, Proceedings of the ITG Conference on Fast FEC 2000," February 2002;
H. Duvail & A. Guillen, A Fast/Easy Adaptive FEC Scheme for Voice/Video Services over ADSL, "IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Communication," October 1996;
Y. Ofek, G.F. Boudreaux, J.C. Kieffer & M.L. Stockman, MAD-FEC: A New FEC for Multi-User Asynchronous Transfer Mode Networks, "IEEE International Symposium on Local Computer Networks," 1995;
W. Sutcliffe, FEC Schemes for Future Broadband Applications, "IEEE GLOBECOM 98," November 1998;
H. R. Sadani, D. P. Mudalige & T. Lakshmi Narayana, A Rate Proportional FEC Scheme for ATM Networks, "IEEE INFOCOM 97," April 1997;
B. Przydatek, F. Jelen & J. Labrecque, An Approach to FEC Scheme Design and Performance Evaluation, "IEEE ICC'93," June 1993;
M. Rangaswami, F. C. Mudalige, A. Tewtrakul & M. Srivastava, Variable Rate FEC Techniques for the ATM Networking, "IEEE GLOBECOM'94," November 1994;
R. Karmakar, A Survey on Error Control Algorithms, "Proceedings of the IEEE," December 1993;
J. L. Hafner, Error Control for Information Storage and Communication, "IEEE Control Systems," February 1993; and
M. Luby, L. Mitzenmacher & A. Shokrollahi, Applying Forward Error Correction to Modems, "Proceedings of the Annual ACM Conference on Supercomputing," November 1995.
Unfortunately, one problem with using these conventional techniques is that many of them require additional bandwidth. This can result in a decrease in a throughput or bandwidth of a communication channel. Another problem is that many of these conventional techniques tend to reduce a data rate, resulting in a decrease in the data rate of a communication channel. Yet another problem is that many of these conventional techniques provide only limited error correction capability. Yet another problem is that most of these conventional techniques are relatively complex.
From the foregoing, it can be appreciated that a need exists for an error control method for use in data communication systems, with an improved error rate and performance. A need also exists for a method and system for transmitting data that avoid or eliminate the disadvantages associated with conventional error control methods and systems. Furthermore, a need exists for an error control method and system which are inexpensive and reliable. The present invention addresses these and other needs.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:42
