Unfortunately, one problem with using these conventional techniques is that many of them require additional bandwidth. This can result in a decrease in a throughput or bandwidth of a communication channel. Another problem is that many of these conventional techniques tend to reduce a data rate, resulting in a decrease in the data rate of a communication channel. Yet another problem is that many of these conventional techniques provide only limited error correction capability. Yet another problem is that most of these conventional techniques are relatively complex.
From the foregoing, it can be appreciated that a need exists for an error control method for use in data communication systems, with an improved error rate and performance. A need also exists for a method and system for transmitting data that avoid or eliminate the disadvantages associated with conventional error control methods and systems. Furthermore, a need exists for an error control method and system which are inexpensive and reliable. The present invention addresses these and other needs.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:15
