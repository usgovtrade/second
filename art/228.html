'As with all other members of the public, our thoughts remain with the residents of this great city.'

The death of Keith Scott has brought out the usual hashtag - #BlackLivesMatter but there is also another hashtag which many have used to express their dismay: #blackonblue - referring to how the officer who killed Mr. Scott is of the same race as him, a police officer. It is still unclear what caused the shooting, police are reported to be at the home and are not speaking.

This event appears to be in the recent line of controversial killings by police and the aftermath on social media. People are outraged at police shootings, while others who have grown more accustomed to them, are growing tired of the reactions to them. But in this situation, the public is concerned about something that happened in their own backyard. It does not matter whether the officer was white or black, the fact that an officer was killed justifies the amount of emotions expressed by the public.

There is something deeply disturbing about the fact that, while thousands of people are being killed across the globe, this is what a police officer shot down in a city in his own country, and people are outraged. As for the suspect, it has not been verified that Keith Joseph's recent struggles in the mortgage market were due to having missed his mortgage payments.

Keith Scott is survived by his wife and seven children. Keith Scott was 32 years old.
