So far this season, there is no indication that she will get back together with ex-husband Thomas Jane and the future of the child they have is also unconfirmed. But the fact that she keeps coming back in a big way with the show is pretty impressive. The “Girls” revival has so far been a mostly positive thing and she’s at the center of most of it.

The “Terrace House” documentary series from Netflix was renewed for a second season in February and will be airing the next month. The series focuses on a group of young people moving into a new place in Tokyo, Tokyo and lives with them in a close and constant surveillance setting as they share the same living space and experience new things together.

The reality series, which was first created by Fuji Television, is based off a Japanese show called “Rooms,” which ran for eight seasons in 2006-2010. “Rooms” is now running in Japan on Fuji TV, and Netflix began airing the English version as a global distribution deal. It seems the company will be doing more with the series, as they recently premiered a second season of the show on their platform, and will be premiering Season 3 on January 7th.

For now, the “Terrace House” second season premiere will be airing the last week of January.

Bryan Fuller has directed the first season of the “Terrace House,” which is based on Japanese series called “Rooms.”

Here’s the synopsis for Season 1 from Netflix:

Fans of Fuller’s (pictured left) work on “Pushing Daisies” and “Hannibal” know what a unique and fascinating filmmaker he is, both in tone and subject matter. He directed “Cabin In The Woods,” one of the most entertaining and unique horror films of all time and the upcoming “High Rise” which will be out next year. The first season of “Terrace House” debuted on Netflix in Japan at the end of 2014, and ran for eight episodes and has been met with much acclaim from audiences and critics. Fuller is co-executive producing the new season of the show on Netflix along with original producer Yasuyuki Tono.

Based on Fuji Television’s original Rooms anime, each half-hour episode captures the young adults’ shared experience in a tiny house, creating a group portrait of how they interact with one another, their friends, and the world around them. Their dynamic in each episode can be likened to that of a band of siblings who have been bestowed with an enormous house, all of them crammed inside together. As in the Japanese series, three men and three women all move into a home on a remote Japanese island and become interconnected through their mutual attraction and shared experiences.

“Terrace House: Opening New Doors” is set to premiere at 8 p.m. PST on January 7, 2015.

Here’s the official press release:

“Terrace House: Opening New Doors” Premieres on Netflix Jan. 7

The global phenomenon that is Terrace House comes to Netflix as a half-hour, six episode mini-series from Japan’s Fuji Television and production company EXILE that tells the story of a group of young people who move into a new, shared house in Tokyo, beginning a uniquely intimate and intimate relationship with the others while exploring life, love and romance. The series follows the Japanese series, Rooms, about a group of six single men and women all moving into a new house.

Celebrated director and writer Bryan Fuller (Heroes, Pushing Daisies, Dead Like Me) directs the first season of Terrace House, a project he co-created with producer David Guarascio. The series, which was previously picked up by Fuji Television for a second season, will premiere on Netflix in early 2015. This is the first time that a TV series from a well-known foreign studio will air in the U.S. on a streaming network rather than on network or cable television.

“We are thrilled to be teaming with Netflix to bring Terrace House to the international audience,” said Yoshihisa Taguchi, producer of Terrace House. “It’s an extremely fun and exciting series and now, thanks to our new partner Netflix, we can bring this unique show to all our fans.”

“Terrace House is a great example of the new generation of storytellers using the global Internet to deliver more culturally relevant and compelling stories. The series offers a uniquely intimate look into Japanese society today, where people interact closely not only with their friends but with people they don’t know well, such as a stranger on a crowded train. Terrace House expands the boundaries of what is considered a ‘reality’ TV show by bringing together the real world with the digital world,” said Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Netflix. “Terrace House’s real life experience combines the best of broadcast TV with the excitement and global reach of online distribution.”

A member of the global Netflix Content Library, Terrace House will premiere globally in late 2014 and early 2015, with simultaneous broadcasts and releases in various territories.
