How captivating was it to see people like Tom Brady's wife, Gisele Bundchen, jump around the field at the conclusion of a tied game? The same phenomenon exists in the WWE, and will continue to do so for as long as sports entertain us. The same goes for the WWE Hall of Fame, where each inductee gets the opportunity to have their story told through the medium of professional wrestling's own form of entertainment."

The WWE Hall of Fame ceremony took place at WWE's "Payback" in 2009. We can expect WWE to continue to feature high-profile people in major sports (and all walks of life) being inducted each year. WWE also recently announced the next inductee for the 2019 class of the Hall of Fame. That induction will take place on Friday, March 29, 2019. The induction ceremony will take place at Wrestlemania 35.

The inductee for 2019 is "Rowdy" Roddy Piper, who was recently the color commentator for Raw. Roddy was the only wrestler to have his own entrance music and theme. His famous entrance was complete with an inflatable "Rowdy" head with red hair sticking out of it. His finishing move was known as the "Samoan Exploder."

The WWE has scheduled another press conference for Thursday, April 11, 2019. As always, you can watch the press conference live here on the New Era for Wrestling Facebook page. We will keep you updated on all the news as it becomes available.
