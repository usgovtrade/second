This codex represents the fifth edition of the game and brings it a whole new style of rules and models. We've done our best to collect all the material on the Chaos Space Marines in this review. All models are linked to their respective datasheet pages on our Warhammer 40,000 site.

Winged Daemon Prince

Traits

The winged daemon prince is a unit of Chaos Daemons which is detailed in Codex: Chaos Space Marines. A winged daemon prince is an independent, ranged, psychic unit that is able to target any enemy unit it sees.

Unit Features

Sight Warpstalker

In the game, a Warpstalker is a unit of Chaos Space Marines that is specialised in shooting.

Units in the shooting phase may opt to shoot instead of their normal movement if they wish to shoot at a unit that is outside their normal firing arc (a 2” diameter). The unit’s model does not need to be in line of sight to shoot. Instead of moving during their shooting phase, units with the Sight Warpstalker trait, including Warpstalkers, may shoot a number of times equal to half the number of models in the unit, including the Warpstalker.

The blast can fire in a straight line out to 18 inches from the Warpstalker’s Spur. This template is used in combination with a template to represent the ranged weapons of each model in the unit. This template can only be used from the shooting phase.

If a model in the unit suffers an instant death, ignore that unit’s movement restrictions for that turn, but only during the movement phase.

Skin of the Beast

Once per game, the warlord can reroll wounds with a Daemonic Weapon trait weapon for a unit within 6". You can use this twice, and only once for any Daemonic Weapon trait weapon per game.
