The two world leaders discussed ways to combat the Islamic State group (ISIS) and other challenges, and signed agreements in energy cooperation.

While the meeting was not mentioned in a statement released by Putin's spokesman or the Kremlin, several news outlets reported the meeting took place.

The Kremlin said after the meeting on Friday that the two countries signed several agreements that will help to stabilize the global energy market.

The agreements include increasing security in the global energy market and creating a more "fair" energy market, as well as a commitment to reduce oil inventories in the global market, according to the BBC.

The Crown Prince and Putin also talked about economic growth, terrorism and energy cooperation.

Russian energy giant Rosneft is a major investor in Saudi Arabia, and the two countries have formed the joint venture PetroSaudi in a series of oil and gas exploration deals.

The crown prince, who is also Saudi Arabia's defense minister, was in China on his first official visit as head of state. He met with Xi, and the leaders announced several bilateral agreements to increase trade and investment.

The crown prince also traveled to Japan for a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, where they discussed challenges facing the world's second largest economy, including the impact of the trade war with the United States.

"We've been working very closely with them on how we can get a breakthrough on the tariff front. And I'm confident that that's where we're headed, but it won't be today," Pompeo said.

Trump and the crown prince also discussed ways to strengthen relations between their countries, according to Saudi and U.S. officials.

The two also discussed the ongoing situation in Venezuela, a subject that has garnered international attention in the last few weeks.
