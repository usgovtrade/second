Ensuring the quality of a site is still of the utmost importance. Through
semantic e-commerce you can ensure that the right items are being presented to
the right audience. Semantic e-commerce is very flexible and can easily be
integrated into your web solution.

In our next installment, we'll address the last of the five layers that
combine to form the semantic web.

*	  If you care about your sites, and in particular the quality
*	  of that quality, then what's being talked about here is the
*	  most significant technology you've never heard of. When you
*	  get a sense of the power of this technology, it will be an
*	  easy jump to conclude that it is of little consequence
*	  until it becomes available to you.

In 1999, RDF and OWL were used for the Semantic Web. Now we're beginning
to see a more integrated approach involving RDF, OWL, OWL Lite and the
latest in Web vocabulary - SKOS, OWL or OWL Lite. All of these tools will
be essential to the success of your Semantic e-commerce solution.

Most of us think of XML as a Web technology. It certainly provides the
power to structure and manage information, but it's the application
of that technology that really makes things work.

These languages and standards are the underlying tools for developing a
semantic web site. It doesn't take a great leap of logic to see that to
create a consistent, powerful and compelling site, you must first
structure your information within a common vocabulary.

The first step is to understand what the standards and languages are
that will help build a site, and what their primary functions are. The
next is to select the right tools and find out how to integrate them
into a successful solution.

If you do a little work in this area now, you will be well on your way to
achieving a very efficient Semantic Web site. You will be able to build
any e-commerce site you can imagine and still have the flexibility to
alter it over time.

In our next installment, we'll discuss the basics of Semantic e-commerce
languages and standards.

* Semantic Web e-Commerce Languages and Standards
*	  by Michael Eisen, President of Mktg&amp;mktg Inc
*	  
*	  The Semantic Web works in two ways. One way is the
*	  eXtensible Markup Language (XML) technology
*	  that brings Web data together in a uniform fashion. The
*	  other is the use of standard vocabulary (both
*	  specific and general) to store, manage, and retrieve
*	  information. You want your site to be about something
*	  and not about everything all at once. That's where
*	  ontologies come in. An ontology is simply a
*	  network of interrelated concepts and information.

You will need an ontology if you expect to create and manage data
about anything that is not the whole world. This includes
semantically rich site content. The ability to understand a site
means understanding more than just what the pages say. It
also includes the way they connect and relate.

Knowing the semantic Web languages and standards is imperative. They
are the underlying tools for developing a Semantic e-commerce
solution. The best way to build a Semantic e-commerce solution is to
first understand the basics of Semantic Web technology, and then
select the right tools. By implementing an integrated system of
standardization and ontologies you can deliver powerful and
compelling e-commerce solutions to your users.

At its heart, the Semantic Web is a repository of knowledge that
defines terms and categories of objects such as people, places,
products, events, and relationships among them. These objects
contain other associated objects and, at their most granular level,
each can be linked to other documents on the Web, with varying
degrees of semantic significance. Semantic Web technologies support
the ability to infer relationships and interconnections between
documents.  In this way, a more complete, yet abstract,
representation of documents and their properties can be developed.

Some languages can store concepts that are of a broad or general
nature. Others contain specialized vocabularies that represent
details about a particular subject area. A good example of a general
vocabulary is the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, which attempts
to define terms that can be applied to a wide range of different
types of documents. Another example of a specialized vocabulary is
that for Semantic e-commerce. This language is used to define
generic terms that are used by e-commerce sites, such as "shoes"
or "cars". This vocabulary is very broad, but only in terms of
describing the types of goods and services that are offered.

While these general and specialized vocabularies exist, there is no
standard format for them. There are several different efforts underway
to define standards for these general and specialized vocabularies.
Standards exist for some of the individual languages, but not for the
combined systems. You need these standards to form a consistent
combination of these languages to make a Semantic e-commerce
solution.

When you want to add semantics to your web site, there are two basic
tasks to be accomplished. First, a consistent vocabulary needs to be
developed that includes terms in both general and specialized
categories. Second, the terms need to be represented as documents
