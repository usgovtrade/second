"You better take a bath." "Hey, can I bring a friend?" "Is that guy your boyfriend?" "It's hard to tell, but it doesn't matter because we don't have time, or else this bird will be dinner for everyone." "What the hell's going on?" "The bees are attacking the whiskey." "That's it, I'm killing myself now." "No!" "No one does anything till I find out what's happening." "It's not the first time the two have crossed paths." "So the bees are like " "Yeah, "Them."" "And whiskey is like " "Them too." "It could have something to do with a certain evil dictator and his new army of bees." "I'm talking about bees." "Okay, okay, I'll find out what's happening." "Hey!" "What's happening?" "!" "Are you serious?" "!" "I got your whiskey!" "Good news, there's nothing to worry about." "So, it's gone?" "I'm afraid so, but at least we caught it in time." "It's probably just a seasonal infestation of bees or something." "No, we can't let them loose on the whole world, especially a world full of people!" "We could really be in trouble here." "If that many bees turned on you, there's no telling what they'd do to you." "Don't you see?" "That would be great!" "You see, all this time I've been asking for an emergency to justify a bigger office!" "Look at you!" "Now the bees are involved in an emergency!" "You hear that?" "!" "We could get bonuses!" "Yes!" "Maybe!" "I don't know!" "Oh, wait, wait." "I'm the Chief of Police, I know a little bit about bees." "Just the bee part." "Now, it's true, all bees have barbed stingers, but I don't think they're deadly." "But if they are, and they got inside of me," "I could die from it!" "I mean, there's nothing I could do!" "I'm defenseless!" "Wait, I don't know if I should be worried about you or about this whole situation." "What do you mean?" "Well, it's very simple." "I've got to call my wife to tell her I'll be late." "I've got to call my wife to tell her I'll be late." "That's what you're worried about?" "Well, yes, that's what the Chief of Police is supposed to worry about, don't you think?" "Oh yeah!" "So why am I here instead of with my wife?" "Oh, I'm sure you have a very good explanation, but the reason I can't tell you right now is that my phone is dead!" "Ahhh." "So the bees are back." "Do you think this is serious enough to kill him?" "I think we can take a chance." "I was talking to the bees." "Hey, you're not the boss of me." "I know you may think you are, but if the bees think that you are " "Yeah, no, I'm sure I'm not the boss of you." "No, I mean you can't tell us what to do!" "I don't want to!" "Can you at least take his car keys and put him in the car?" "No!" "Why not?" "I don't need your help!" "I don't want your help!" "Okay, fine, we'll do it without you!" "I just got used to having you around." "You're a really good human, and I would like to keep you around." "Ohhh..." "Honey, honey!" "Help me!" "It's just like when I was a little boy." "Help!" "Hey, I just got an idea!" "Help!" "I'll never live this down." "The bees are just trying to sting me." "No, no, I don't want to die!" "Hey, hey, you might as well let go." "If you don't die, you'll be okay." "If you die," "I'll have no one to hang out with." "I've been looking for you, and now I finally found you." "My old enemy, the Chief of Police." "How do you know I'm the Chief of Police?" "You must have seen my uniform." "I don't see anything." "Hey, do you remember that time you took your uniform off?" "You must be talking about the time I was standing naked in my apartment," " and you burst in with my pants?" " Oh, yeah, that was crazy!" "All right!" "This is crazy!" "It's a mess!" "Do you have any idea how much work that uniform takes?" "I just want to wash it." "Hey, hey, who needs all that water?" "Just hang it out of the window and let them spray it off." "It's like your own personal car wash!" "Look at this!" "The bees got away from you." "Oh no!" "That was it." "I don't think you'll live." "Nooo, noooo!" "Why?" "That's okay." "But don't you want me to be a hero?" "For this?" "I just want a decent shirt." "You're wrong, it's not the bees' fault, it's my fault!" "Now you have to die for me to have another chance!" "Well, you know, there is another way." "We could just leave him in the trunk of the car." "He might last a little bit longer there." "No!" "No, he's my best friend!" "I can't kill him!" "Okay, if I die, what's gonna happen to my wife?" "Are you sure you're okay in there?" "Is there a weird noise?" "Nah, nothing weird going on." "All clear." "Hey, hey, honey!" "Honey, honey, honey!" "What are you doing?" "!" "Oh, come on!" "Come on, come on, come on, come on." "Come on, you can do it!" "Why don't you watch where you're going?" "You're not the boss of me!" "Oh, fine, I'll do it myself." "Why don't you stay and help me?" "Oh, come on." "What's going on?" "!" "You just told me to be more patient!" "Hey, I want to give my life!" "You just have to give me a reason!" "If I can't save my friend, then all is lost." "Then all is lost." "And if you can't save my friend, then all is lost." "He's not in there." "Then all is lost." "Well, I give up." "All is lost." "No!" "I'm giving up because I've got a plan, and I think I can get you out of there!" "Well, I'm not gonna change my mind about it!" "It's the right thing to do!" "And you know what?" "I will kill myself to prove it." "Oh, come on." "Be my friend!" "Don't do it!" "Get out of there." "You're gonna kill yourself for me!" "I'm going to do it right now." "It's not right." "Just listen to me." "Stop!" "What do you know?" "I thought I was your friend, but I guess I'm just another one of your bees." "Honey, no!" "I will cut off your head with my ax." "No, honey!" "Don't do it." "I was all confused, but now I can see clearly." "I will chop off your head with my ax." "Don't do it." "I'll chop off your head with my ax." " No, don't do it!" " No, no, no!" "Don't do it!" "What's going on?" "He was taking too long." "He was taking too long!" "No!" "Don't you see what I've been trying to tell you?" "If you kill yourself, then it will come out that way!" "Honey, you're right!" "Maybe the bees did mean for you to be the boss of me after all!" "I don't want to kill myself." "Just let me out of here!" "Well, I'll be." "Honey?" "You are my best friend!" "Yeah, I know." "Honey, honey, honey!" "Yeah, I'm still alive." "Hate the bees."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:32
