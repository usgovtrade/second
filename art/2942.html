"I had to make a quick decision whether it was time to get out or stay in and play around. So I decided to just go ahead and jump in."

Alyson's family, however, was not happy with their daughter's decision. "That's when they really started yelling. There were seven of us in the pool. They came out in their robes to see what was going on."

She didn't mean to startle anyone: "The house was very quiet and we were all swimming around, I saw a pair of shoes next to the pool and got out."

Antoine added: "It wasn't like she jumped in by herself - her step-dad had to grab her. My wife was like 'she has a bathing suit on', but it was a skirt."

So far, only one person in the family has been brave enough to talk to Alyson: her cousin. "She messaged me and said that was a little ridiculous," Alyson says, laughing. "She was like, 'Why did you do that?'"

But, Antoine said: "It's just a phase that she will grow out of it."

"Her dad's like, 'You didn't get kicked out of school for doing that?' I was like, 'Dude, I got kicked out of school for skipping class."

"I don't know what's gonna happen. It was just something fun we decided to do," she says. "It's just that everyone is really freaking out. I'm scared to go back and work out in the gym. I love my workout! It's just that I'm so embarrassed and I don't know what's going to happen."

In the meantime, the family has been "loving her experience," and thinks "she will probably regret it in a few weeks."

Although Antoine is glad that his daughter can stand up for herself, he admits: "It's not really a good first time. I'm not used to seeing her doing something like this."

He told Pop Sugar: "We just have to trust our instincts, be patient and kind with her... and I'm thankful that she was doing it at a private pool... If it was in a public pool, she would've got kicked out, but that's one thing my wife and I can't handle!"

"When she has kids, we will be like, 'oh my gosh, we can't wait to watch you do this.'"

"The more you think about it, the more you realize that there's nothing so bad about a girl wearing a bathing suit."

This week we're tackling bathing suits. And we're breaking it down into two segments. Because there's always something so bad about a girl (or a dude) in a bathing suit. But for all that shit - there's so much more good. (There's a lot of bad, but it's all in the eye of the beholder.)

And if you don't believe us, Alyssa Beth, a sophomore in high school, just shared the story of how she was recently told to get out of her bathing suit and come into the gym to do some laps in her underwear. And people loved her story so much that they wanted to share theirs, too.

She posted her story on her website and it made the rounds on Facebook, so we wanted to round out the conversation with a broader audience.

Tell us about your first swimsuit. What kind of reaction did you get when you put that on?

When I was about 5 or 6 I would wear boy underwear with bra, and a thong, and I was in the bathroom and people would knock on the door to see what I was doing. That was my first reaction.

And I think the first time I ever wore a swimsuit I was about 8 and I really wanted to look cute and stuff, so I wanted to look cute and stuff. And I would have to go swimming with my mom and stuff, so I was kind of forced to wear it and, for some reason, I felt so confident in it. And my mom thought I looked so cute. I kind of did. And my mom asked if she was gonna be in the picture so she can give it to her boyfriend.

It's a little creepy that they wanted you to wear it around. You should be able to wear that, especially with her as a mom. She's like your everything, right?

And my mom used to have her boyfriend's phone number and her phone book and I used to memorize it and I would look up what number I would write down so that I could call it.

Were your parents happy that you weren't going to wear it? Like, did they tell you that you look so cute or was it more of like a no-no.

They told me it was embarrassing and stuff, and stuff like that. But when I tried it on, I felt so good and so confident. And so when they saw that, they said, "Let's go out to eat!"

Did you feel like you would be a little more confident in yourself? Like there was no comparison between what it looked like on you and how it looked on some other people.

Yeah, exactly.

Why do you think that was? Why was that such a big deal for your parents?

I really don't know. I guess it was more about the situation and me being on the cover of my mom's phone book, and stuff like that. It was more about being a big deal than me. And my mom got that from her sister. Her sister would come out on a cover of her phone book.

Did they even really care about the pictures? Or did they just get upset when you took the pictures?

We used to go to the mall. And every single time we walked past that store and went in it was like, "You're so cute!" And my mom would say, "I don't care." And I think now she kind of realizes that.

But the thing was my brother would get embarrassed by it, or by my clothes, and he would run away from me when people would ask him to take a picture with him, and stuff like that. And he thought it was stupid. And so he was embarrassed of me when I was little.

But why did she get into that?

I guess it was a phase. I think that maybe she used to go out with him on a date or something. I don't know.

I have never been asked to take off my bathing suit. Ever.

There's a picture of me as a baby in my grandmother's house and I'm just so, so happy about my belly. And she had that picture on her walls and her wallpaper and shit. And she called my cousin and was like, "What should I do?" And my cousin is like, "Just ask for it to be taken down." And she was like, "I don't know." And it was such a big deal for me.

And I remember that she kept it in there for like five years until she took it down. And I didn't even know that I was wearing a bathing suit. I just knew that I had a cute belly.

Does she ever still have clothes up?

Oh yeah, she has clothes up on her walls. The thing is I didn't want to take it down because I thought that everyone would think that I was so ugly.

I feel like that's the worst thing that's ever happened to you. And it just happens so early on, too.

Yeah, I just got the idea like all of a sudden. And I was like, "All right, I'm just gonna wear it." And then my friend started doing it, too, and I was like, "Oh my God."

Is that the first time you ever felt really confident in yourself?

Yeah. I started to get even more confident when I was like 14 and then I just had boobs and stuff. And I guess when you get older it's hard to be so confident because your clothes start to get bigger and you're uncomfortable with how they fit and stuff. So I started just focusing on how I felt in the mirror and how I felt about myself because then it would look good in the mirror. And I learned how to apply my makeup, and how to do my hair and stuff.

What would you consider being the most embarrassing part of it?

I was out the other day and somebody was taking a picture of me on a bicycle. And I was doing the same pose that I had in a photo shoot on the Internet. So somebody was taking pictures of me, and I'm wearing a bathing suit on the bicycle. It was crazy. I was like, "Who was taking pictures?" And she was like, "Oh, it's my mom." It was crazy.

You were actually embarrassed?

No, but when I saw that photo I was like, "Whoa." I didn't even know. So, I kind of think it's funny. It's not that bad.

What does that kind of do to you when you're a kid?

You know, in school you're always wearing a bathing suit because of gym class</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:55
