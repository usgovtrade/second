With a special formulation of dermal fillers, Dr. Lai creates a smooth and seamless look of fullness.

Involves no downtime, no injection of botulinum toxin and no anesthesia.

This permanent treatment for the appearance of veins works by creating an illusion of fullness and smoothing the skin. This results in a natural look that can last between four to six months.

2. Aesthetic Facial Rejuvenation

We all age! Now you can reverse some of those signs of aging that come with time.

There are many reasons you may want to look your best. You may be going on vacation and want a refreshed appearance. You may be starting a new job. Or, you may just want to look good for yourself.

Regardless of the reason, Dr. Lai can restore your youth with BOTOX® Cosmetic or Juvederm®. Juvederm and Botox provide immediate effects, helping you look fresh and restored to a younger look.

As a result, there is no downtime, no need for surgical intervention and no anesthesia needed to perform the treatment.

How do BOTOX® and Juvederm® work?

These cosmetic treatments use a combination of your own BOTOX® or Juvederm® (injectable gels) with skin care, including lasers and fillers to produce stunning results for your face.

3. Voluptuous Breasts with Dermal Fillers

Would you like a bigger chest? Some women would love to look that way, but they’re worried about surgery or the risk of complications.

Dr. Lai offers dermal fillers to give you the ideal amount of fullness without surgery or anesthesia. This is an ideal cosmetic procedure for you to achieve that fuller bust that you’ve always dreamed of. You can choose between two types of treatments:

1. Juvederm® Gel

Juvederm® is a safe and effective filler that gives you fullness that lasts for six to nine months.

The procedure takes about 30 minutes and involves no anesthesia or downtime. A small amount of Juvederm is placed under the skin in the breast. After three to five months, a needle can be used to extract the excess Juvederm gel.

2. Radiesse®

Radiesse® fills in your breast area to give you fullness and fullness without the need for surgery.

This filler gives you the appearance of natural firmness and lift and lasts for up to two years.

You can expect to see results after two to three months, and the Radiesse® treatment has no downtime.

For best results, Dr. Lai offers treatments that combine the two fillers to give you a smoother, more natural look.

4. Enhanced Lips with Dermal Fillers

Would you like fuller lips? You can see real results from the use of dermal fillers to enhance your lips.

Dr. Lai uses dermal fillers to create fullness in the lips while protecting them from damage.

He has experience with a variety of techniques for the lips:

If you have chapped lips, Dr. Lai can apply Radiesse® Lip Implant to enhance your lips. You can expect to see a noticeable difference within two months.

If your lips are not as full or plump as you would like, Radiesse® Liquid Silicone Implant is an effective solution to provide an enhanced appearance and lips fullness that lasts up to two years.

If you want fuller lips that are more like real lips, then you can inject Juvederm® Ultra Plus Soft Plus XC into your lips. Dr. Lai can create the fullest, plumpest lips possible with Juvederm® in just one visit.

After you decide on the lip treatment, your lip fullness will be boosted through a consultation with Dr. Lai. Dr. Lai will assess your lips to determine which combination of treatments will achieve your ideal results.

The best ways to achieve lip fullness

1. Juvederm® Ultra Plus Soft Plus XC

This technique helps you create the appearance of fuller, younger lips.

Juvederm® gives you a natural fullness in your lips and creates fullness with minimal downtime and anesthesia.

The best way to achieve this is to use Juvéderm® Ultra Plus Soft Plus XC, a new formulation of dermal filler.

2. Radiesse® Liquid Silicone Implant

This treatment is effective for lip enhancement, but you should avoid use of your lips for three weeks after the procedure.

It’s very important to avoid using your lips because they need to heal after this treatment.

Radiesse® is an injectable filler that helps you enhance your lips in just one visit and is a great way to achieve a fuller, more natural-looking lips that lasts for up to two years.

4. Radiesse® Lift & Fill

For lip enhancement, Radiesse® Lift & Fill is very effective in creating a fuller, natural-looking lip.

With this treatment, you get a natural result that lasts for up to two years.

You’ll see immediate results in about three days with no downtime.

The procedure takes just about 30 minutes and can last for up to two years. Dr. Lai uses Radiesse® Lift & Fill with an advanced skin tightening treatment to create more volume and fullness without the need for surgery or scars.

Results with the Radiesse® Lift & Fill

After the treatment, you can expect some swelling and bruising, but Dr. Lai will give you instructions on how to care for your lips and what exercises you can do to speed up the healing process.

The results are subtle but you can notice a fuller, rounder look in your lips.

How long do the results last?

Over the course of two years, the results last through natural breakdown, which occurs over time.

It’s a common misconception that collagen-related treatments will stop working after six months. However, the results last through natural breakdown, which is much slower than the results of Botox, Juvederm and other dermal fillers.

If you’re looking for some help to get rid of sagging and loss of skin elasticity around your nose, lips, chin and other areas, dermal fillers are ideal for you.

6. Cheek Enhancement with Dermal Fillers

Would you like fuller cheeks without the need for surgery or scars? If so, dermal fillers can provide the ideal results.

Dr. Lai can boost your cheeks and get rid of the sagging skin that you may be embarrassed by.

You can expect to see noticeable results after one treatment, and there’s no downtime.

Your cheeks will become fuller and the loss of skin elasticity will be less noticeable after your treatment.

The best way to achieve lip fullness is by combining Radiesse® to give you a natural fullness and boost and Juvederm to boost your lips.

Dermal fillers for the face provide great results without surgery or scars. The treatment takes only 30 minutes and you can even walk in, lay down and Dr. Lai can do all of this for you while you wait.

Why is BOTOX® a good treatment for the face?

Are you tired of losing your hair? If so, BOTOX® is a good treatment to make you look refreshed and restore the youthful appearance you had as a teenager.

It’s important to note that BOTOX® is a very safe, non-surgical procedure that involves no anesthesia.

BOTOX® is an injectable drug that relaxes facial muscles in the forehead and around the eyes. It makes it easier for people who wear glasses to remove their frames.

This BOTOX® treatment gives you the appearance of fullness without the pain and trauma associated with a surgical procedure. It also makes the muscles around your eyes and mouth look naturally smooth.

In a 30-minute appointment, Dr. Lai inserts a few tiny lines in your forehead, temples and eye sockets and provides treatments that give you a dramatic, youthful look for up to four months.
