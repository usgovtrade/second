As soon as it has been commercialised it will bring about drastic changes in the concrete industry. If you're having any concrete work done and you ask what it's worth getting the graphene option, your bill could be 10 to 30% cheaper. It's already so good at replacing some fillers with a better material (think asbestos), we may be on the verge of a revolution in the concrete industry that will mean that no new concrete-based structures can be built after this time.

Yes, there are many things that are not possible using graphene now, but graphene is a base platform to start from, and with time as it is so cheap, I can only see the potential for it to be developed, and what is possible on the next level. Graphene is not a solution to everything at the moment, but at some point it will improve it's performance, I mean graphene could be developed to become the strong, lightweight structural component material that graphene was originally intended to be. I am just looking forward to the next revolution... and how many more decades will it take...

I have to say that, I agree with most of your comments regarding the challenges and possibilities of graphene. I think the most significant problem with cement is, from a practical point of view, that there is no real choice in the way it is produced - ie. they have to source what they need from some source. This may actually be why it has not been widely commercialized yet. The cement industry has been around for hundreds of years, you would think that by now they would have found the ideal source of raw materials and the ideal processes for extraction. I suppose their research labs are filled with scientists (or at least physicists) that would be happy to work in that area, so that they can develop their own technology. But I suppose that is more work than they really need, so they are unlikely to be doing it. Or maybe they are doing it, and that is the reason why it hasn't been commercialized. Even if this is the case, I suspect that the cost of going out on your own might be much more than they are willing to pay at the moment. Again, this could be changing soon.

I think that once graphene has been commercialized, you will find that there is a very good chance that someone will make concrete based on graphene. I really have no idea what the price will be at that point though. Maybe it will be cheap enough for people to consider not using concrete at all.

I don't know, I can't just accept that without a fight. Concrete is an amazing material, and one that will see many more upgrades in it's life. The latest was when "air curing" was discovered. In Europe it has been around since the 70s, and was the subject of intense R&D in Germany in the 80s and 90s, until this was commercialized in the USA. So if something works on the lab bench, there is no reason it should take a couple of decades to take hold in the real world.

The first generation of graphene/Graphene reinforced concrete products will not be available for almost 2 more years. If at that time the product is commercialized, the price will be much more than $0.05 per Kg.

For the past 2 years only some academics have been able to produce it or conduct test in one or two universities/companies as for commercialization in this industry, it's more difficult. First because graphene is still at research stages (but not at development stages) and still cannot be reproduced the same way to reproduce a mass production. Second, current technology is not cheap. So now that graphene has started to be commercialized, it is expected that the price will drop to at least 5 times cheaper than the current price of graphene (if it has a price, because we don't know yet, it's too early). As for graphene production, the company is still developing with research partners in Canada, Europe, Russia and Korea and its latest result is that the production is becoming more cost efficient each day, and once they can produce it more cheaply and can get more of it without breaking the current cost production, then they will start producing mass production. However, the other problem is that to mass produce graphene, it requires a certain technology that is at the current stage is very much developing... If the graphene producer were to start mass producing now (and this can be done in a short time), then it is expected to produce less than 500 Kg per month of graphene so far... So only when the technology for the graphene production reached 100% efficiency, will be enough to produce mass quantities of graphene. The real problem now is when can it be done. It will not be impossible in one or two years but rather will be in maybe around 2 years time? It is a very important stage because once it is there, you can have the material in mass production at very low cost. When it's there, you can have graphene available at very affordable prices.

Graphene as a building material and construction material is not what Graphene is all about. Graphene can be a useful tool to help design new buildings and even repair and reinforce existing buildings without much effort. The key thing about graphene, which makes graphene so unique, it is lightweight, strong, waterproof, fire proof, and capable of withstanding extreme conditions, high temperatures, and vibrations. These characteristics make graphene a perfect candidate for use in almost any type of building.

I see it as a perfect composite material that will replace any plastic</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:24
