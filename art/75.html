I've never had your beer, but I do get the "go to the fridge, get your beer, take it to the bar, I'm never going to get that beer."
If I'm in the habit of going to the fridge, I'd do the following:

It's the beer that is going to get warm.

The cold temperature reduces the beer's surface</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:05
