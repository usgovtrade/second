To the average consumer, these materials may seem pretty, but to those in the field of mechanical engineering, they're groundbreaking. The promise of these materials is enormous.

What makes graphene so extraordinary is that it has a carbon atom that forms a strong structure. Because carbon has a larger atomic radius than hydrogen, this makes graphene stronger than steel or concrete.

It's incredible that this is possible. When you take a glass of orange juice, you can see the layers of oranges, which results in the color. The carbon atom of the graphene is so big that it acts the same way, and that means that there are no layers to it, therefore, there's no color.

This can also be applied to energy. Imagine taking aluminum, making it conductive, and applying it to buildings. We could potentially use a small amount of aluminum to generate renewable power in a big building.

The potential is almost endless. The only thing that is holding back this technology is a fundamental change in how we use glass.

This was made possible by the efforts of many people at Samsung. Not only did the Samsung engineers make it happen, but my mentors made sure it was a success. I owe my success to them. This was the hardest piece of work I've ever done, so I would like to thank everybody who helped me out in the shop.

Without Samsung, I would not be where I am.

A great honor for me.

My family has always been proud of my accomplishments, and they have been there for me through everything. I am blessed to have the career I have, and it's because of them.

This work is so important. I'm excited to show the world the wonder of graphene. We could build bridges that are never going to break, buildings that never collapse, roads that never give way, and glass that is so strong that it would never break. This will change the world.
