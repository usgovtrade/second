The Scent Of WaterBy The Sea
Written by: L.D. Tremblay & Robert Tremblay

The band L.D. Tremblay & Robert Tremblay are back with a new CD! It’s their debut CD. And you’ll hear them now on Spotify. L.D. Tremblay & Robert Tremblay: “The Scent of Water” continues to prove that their approach is timeless and their music timeless, that is, full of meaning.

“The Scent of Water” takes us on a voyage to the sea. The CD opens with two long tracks, “The Sea in Winter” and “Sea Rhythm” – an eerie journey into the ocean depths. And then, the music swells with “The Sea at Dawn,” which is another voyage and another evocation of the majesty of this mysterious element and all the mysteries it contains. It’s an enchanting and magical journey through the world of the sea. There’s a certain sense of mystery to it, a deep sense of longing. These are themes that the band members are well familiar with – their grandfather and father are fishermen.

A lot of time has passed, and yet, even though we can’t see the ocean today, and it was here millions of years ago, we can still feel its mystery and its charm. These are themes that also make this CD very attractive to listeners. They offer a chance for listeners to imagine what it must have been like in the first century of exploration of the new continent of America. These songs offer a look at how sailors of that era came into contact with this mysterious element of their lives – its scent of water and its sound. It’s a magical encounter, no doubt.

Listeners can hear the sea in the songs as if they were looking at a painting by Paul Gauguin or Vincent van Gogh, or the great Paul Klee. A few days ago, in the middle of a beautiful fall day, it was raining, but as I watched a storm rolling in from the north, I knew it was time to take my laptop and head for the deck to write the lyrics for “The Sea in Winter,” for “Sea Rhythm,” and for “Sea at Dawn.” I went out on the deck, and saw the waves. I could hear the ocean, and I could hear the ocean-gales roaring and whistling like an old-fashioned steam-whistle with a deep whistle. I took the words from my computer and I wrote them down. Then I found my pen and my notebook and I added a few notes. But I didn’t bother to write it out. Instead, I took my digital recorder and I added the sea sounds to the music that I wrote, and I added the sound of the ship’s engine from the deck.

It’s all part of the atmosphere that we want to recreate in this CD. And of course, it is a very beautiful CD, with a very captivating rhythm. And of course, as I said before, these guys are very talented musicians. You’ll find yourself captivated by the music and mesmerized by these amazing sounds, and you’ll find yourself hearing the smell of the ocean in the songs.” - L.D. Tremblay

I recently read that when he goes out with his buddies for his nightly stroll, he’s known to take his camera with him and he often takes pictures of things, as a sort of a sort of visual diary of what’s happening around him. The things he pictures. The things that excite him. In other words, the photos he takes of what captures his attention.

But a lot of those photos are of places that he’s never been. A lot of those photos are in foreign countries. But most of all, a lot of those photos are about things that happen in other countries. Places he’s never been to, in other words.

For his CD “The Scent of Water,” L.D. Tremblay is a bit like he’s out looking for things to capture on film with his camera. I guess in a way, we’re on a voyage that is an adventure that is a vacation in our imaginations. Tremblay has a way with words, and a way with music. He was kind enough to take the time to chat with us about the CD, and the songs on it, as well as the places he’s been. We talked about how that has influenced the songs on the CD, and I asked him about the places he’s been, as well as things that are found in the songs.

Music in motion
I’m an amateur photographer and love to shoot everything from architecture to landscapes, all things that catch my eye in some way. It’s my passion and I have so much fun doing it. Even though it may not be about where you can take the photos, it’s a whole different experience taking them. And I have been taking some recent photos in Canada and the USA. I was looking forward to traveling all over this country in the near future, but unfortunately my father became seriously ill and passed away just before we planned a trip to the Canadian Rockies.

For a few years now, I’ve been wanting to do some photo travels in New York City, so I plan on a trip to that city in the near future. I love the feeling of being there because it’s the center of the world for me. I also love it because I can sit in one spot and see what’s happening in the street or on the subway. It’s not like we’re driving, or riding a bike, or taking a walk. We have time to really look around at what’s happening on the street.

And if you can imagine being in New York and watching a street scene, being a bit on the other side of the street, and looking in from a distance and being able to get a sense of the street, it gives you a very unique perspective on things that you probably never would have seen if you were going along with the crowd. And if you take those photographs, and you’re looking at the scene with your viewfinder, and you see people going to work, or walking down the street, or waiting for a bus, or riding the subway, or walking their dog, and you look down your lens and you see these moving humans on their way to work or school or whatever they’re going to do, you might get the impression that we’re all very busy people, and that’s not the case. We all have our own stories to tell.

And while I’m photographing these scenes that interest me, I’m trying to create a balance between the things that catch my eye and the music that I want to compose. I’m capturing what catches my eye, and what gets my attention. So there’s a lot of different components that are in this CD. They could be like a movie, you could imagine, a road movie that takes us from here to there, and at the end of it we’ll be where we were at the start, but a lot of people won’t notice, because there will be a new person in the city for us to watch, or in our neighborhood, and that will make us even more curious about where the person came from.

But it’s a whole different experience from simply being in an apartment somewhere, or working in an office somewhere. In a way, New York City was the first city in the world I was allowed to go and experience, for all these places that I visit on the CD. They have a lot to do with what I do as a photographer. I take pictures of things that I would like to remember. If you’re walking along the streets and you see an interesting person, a new experience, a strange place, or something that’s beautiful, it’s like everything comes together for me. And I love the memories that I’ve created in a city.

Creating the atmosphere
There are several locations that are important for the mood that is captured in the CD. The first location is “Windy City,” a song that tells the story of how</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:43
