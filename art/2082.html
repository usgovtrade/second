Like, you know, like a kaleidoscope, when you're tired and the rain's too much to bear...

Like a kaleidoscope of light

Or a million dancing colours in a sea of gloom.

Like the kaleidoscope of the mind... that's full of tricks and traps and

Walking in the dark, you know.

Walking in the dark and you can't forget, you know.

And the darkness fills you with its fear. But all I can see...

is a kaleidoscope of light.

I don't know what you see, I only see a kaleidoscope of light.

I don't know what you think, I only see a kaleidoscope of light.

You've got the world at your feet, but I see a kaleidoscope of light.

There's so many paths you can take. And all you ever ask...

is why, why, why? And there's so many paths you can take.

You're living in a kaleidoscope, and all I see is a kaleidoscope.

Hey hey!

You're looking for answers. You want a straight answer? Well, here it is, in simple three-syllable words, the only way it can be explained. This song is about the state of our time, about how we live and what the world looks like through our eyes.

It's about the nature of light, and why we choose to look at everything in the world through either the eye or the mind. Or both. Maybe there's no reason at all. That'd be nice.

Watching from inside a kaleidoscope, you see the entire picture as though in a dream. I'd been told to do that, on a record or a stage, always. Always do it for the people, or you get sick.

So many roads to take, we only have to choose which way we're going to go.

And if you've got a kaleidoscope, you must learn to master its secrets. So many roads to take, and all I've ever heard...

is why? Why? Why? And if you're really lucky, if you're really blessed,

you get to feel the world's heartbeat in your hands.

Watching from inside a kaleidoscope, you're gonna see the truth when the stars come crashing down. You've got the world at your feet, it's never been so easy. It's never been so simple.

Watching from inside a kaleidoscope, you're gonna see the entire picture as though in a dream. It's just a choice. It's never been so simple.

Watching from inside a kaleidoscope, you're gonna see the entire picture as though in a dream. It's a choice. It's never been so simple.

So many roads to take, you only have to decide how far you're going to go.

And if you see your own shadow in the water, you know your time has come.

Walking in the dark and you can't forget, you know.

And the darkness fills you with fear, but all I can see...

is a kaleidoscope of light.

I don't know what you see, I only see a kaleidoscope of light.

I don't know what you think, I only see a kaleidoscope of light.

You've got the world at your feet, but I see a kaleidoscope of light.

There's so many paths you can take. And all you ever ask...

is why, why, why? And there's so many paths you can take.

You're living in a kaleidoscope, and all I see is a kaleidoscope.

Kaleidoscope of light...

You're living in a kaleidoscope, and all I see is a kaleidoscope.

Why, why...?

You're living in a kaleidoscope, and all I see is a kaleidoscope.

Kaleidoscope of light.

# RIVER MAIDEN

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

My head is in a knot, from knowing where I'm going. And where I'm going doesn't seem to matter. All that matters is the way I feel right now.

The river maidens were dancing for us, but we're already gone.

Where are the river maidens? Do we have to dance with anybody?

The river maidens danced to make us feel high.

And while we're feeling high, the world seems very low.

All of a sudden, nothing matters. All of a sudden, we're on another planet.

We're on another planet and no one is taking us home again.

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

The world around me feels so small. And all I hear is a song, that's telling me how small we all are.

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

The world around me feels so small. And all I hear is a song, that's telling me how small we all are.

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

When I'm with you, you make me feel so high. And when I am high, I feel so low.

# SHOW ME A RIVER

Oh, there's a mystery there, where the river sings.

I'll show you a river

Show me a river, so I can swim in it.

And get to know where I'm going, where my river's going.

The water flows to the sea, out past the barren mountain.

I'll show you a river

Show me a river, so I can swim in it.

Where do the mountains run to, and where is the sea?

I'll show you a river,

show me a river, so I can swim in it.

I'll show you a river, show me a river.

I don't know when I left the land,

I just know the stars were shining bright,

shining bright.

I'll show you a river

Show me a river, so I can swim in it.

And get to know where I'm going, where my river's going.

I'll show you a river

Show me a river, so I can swim in it.

Show me a river, show me a river.

I don't know where I left the land, I just know the stars were shining bright, and shining bright.

I'll show you a river

show me a river, so I can swim in it.

And get to know where I'm going, where my river's going.

I'll show you a river

Show me a river, so I can swim in it.

show me a river, show me a river.

And get to know where I'm going, where my river's going.

And get to know where I'm going, where my river's going.

And get to know where I'm going, where my river's going.

And get to know where I'm going, where my river's going.

# THE BONEYARD

The bone is the oldest machine in the world.

The human bones keep quiet all the time,

but they don't know why.

So the bones let us use them to play all our games,

until they're full of holes and start to fall apart.

But you can't believe what you can't see.

I'll show you a bone.

I'll show you a bone and then we'll have something to talk about.

We live on the bones of our ancestors,

and every night, there's another one.

And the bones keep us all awake all night and day, and day.

So the bones let us use them to play all our games,

until they're full of holes and start to fall apart.

But you can't believe what you can</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:57
