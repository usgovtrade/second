At the center of the operation is a $75,000 device (currently sitting in an NPD test lab) that’s capable of monitoring in real time the weight and motion of any individual in the venue. On Friday nights during the early half of this year’s inaugural season, this technology is being used to help out security by identifying potential problems as they occur. While most of the system’s components are designed to be nonintrusive, those who fail to scan their wristbands prior to entering the premises are given a warning as they approach the turnstiles. “If they choose not to scan, we’ve got this badge-reader,” he explains, extending the forearm on his left arm. “As they pass the scanners, it reads their UID [unique identification number]. If we can’t scan it or if there’s no UID, we give them a little warning,” he adds with a chuckle. “It’s going to be a good experience. We’re only going to issue warnings, and then we’re going to throw you out.”

He then offers the demonstration: “We’ve got a lot of ideas, and I think we’re going to start executing on them fairly soon. Then I’ll have a bunch of surprises for the players and the fans in terms of the technology we’re introducing. It’s something they’re not expecting.”

As a former NBA executive, Ivey’s approach to the Nuggets’ technology is largely informed by his experiences at the Association level. While it’s likely that some of the company’s applications could be incorporated into the future plans of the NBA (for example, the new league-wide technology upgrade), he understands that a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work. Still, he’s optimistic that there will be more synergy between the leagues — a situation he’s encouraged by. “I feel pretty good about where we’re at,” he says, noting that Denver’s tech department has worked with both the NBA and the NHL. “I think we’ve got a lot of ideas, and I think we’re going to start executing on them fairly soon.”

The tech upgrade

“What’s cool about our technology is that if you think about the NBA experience, and how many people go to a game with their devices, our technology is going to transform that experience. I’m going to go ahead and be honest with you — this is probably my favorite part of my job — we’re going to turn the entire face of sports. I’ve been on both sides of this for a long time, and it’s going to be the most interesting thing I’ve ever done.”

While much has been made about the Nuggets’ recent acquisition of the NBA’s 10th pick, there are a lot of different storylines to consider in Denver. As former NBA and ESPN executive Larry Coon once told me, in some ways the organization has actually been ahead of the curve. It’s important to remember that in 2007 the Nuggets were the first team to introduce Wi-Fi at every game. And in 2008 the team also piloted its way into the forefront of using data analytics. As Coon described it, there were “a lot of technological innovations under the sheets” as the team and their partners pushed forward.

A longtime employee of the Association, Coon served as the team’s CIO prior to being named president of the San Antonio Spurs in 2013. Prior to entering the NBA world, he served as a vice president of technology and operations for the Minnesota Timberwolves. The last several years for Coon have also been defined by two notable successes: the hiring of David Kahn and George Karl as executives. Along with Coon’s own contributions, Coon says that Karl in particular helped put the team on the map. “He was not afraid to try new things,” says Coon. “That, to me, is something that’s really important.”

During Coon’s time with the Nuggets (and even before), both Kahn and Karl recognized that to be competitive with the Association, they would need to be using technology to augment the current roster. “And so they both had an understanding that technology was going to be really important for our organization. I think that helped us a lot in terms of putting the players and our organization at the forefront,” he says. “That’s a key to doing well in this era. Not everyone is doing well, and it’s tough for everybody. But for us, if you’re going to succeed, you need to have your technology and technology that’s going to provide an edge.”

Coon believes that being ahead of the curve, particularly with regard to technology, will be one of the main factors that will help the organization’s transition back to the Mile High City. “In the end, all the money spent is going to pay off, but you’ve got to make sure that you’ve got the right people, the right processes, the right tools,” says Coon. “And so I would definitely say that the investment was a key piece of being able to continue to be successful.”

There were four key areas of investment: “the investment in the coach and our franchise at the time; the technology that was being built for us; just the infrastructure that was going on in the arena; and the technology in the other key assets,” he says.

With regard to how Denver’s IT systems might use data in new ways, Coon believes that a data dashboard is essential to improving efficiency and fan experience.

“If you think about your fan experience, it’s not just about giving them access, but it’s about giving them a better experience,” he says. “I think we all live in a time where you can’t really have any excuses, right? If you’re not providing a great experience for your fans, you’ve got to ask yourself why not.”

The team plans to take a similar approach to providing an engaging experience for its fans and will do so by leveraging data to do so. “I think technology can help us in a variety of different ways. One of those is using technology as an enhancement to the experience — how do we make them have a great experience in the stadium? But it also helps us understand — which is one of our keys — [us] understanding the customer, the fan, the business, or any of those interactions that occur, which helps us to be smart with that investment,” he adds.

Aside from the fan experience, Coon says that technology will also play a role in how the organization’s key personnel use their time. “One of the key assets in this whole transition was the hiring of the basketball coaches — we hired George Karl, and, more importantly, hired David Kahn,” he says. “And, because of those two guys, we brought in a different vision and a different approach to the way we thought about our staff — technology was at the forefront.”

Coon continues, “How are you going to have access to all these different elements? And then also the key question for me was what tools are we going to use? Are they tools that are going to provide value to the organization, whether it be from technology or from analytics? If they are, then you’ve got to make sure that those tools are working for you. The way you determine that is through the analytics or the technology. What’s cool about our technology is that if you think about the NBA experience, and how many people go to a game with their devices, our technology is going to transform that experience. I’m going to go ahead and be honest with you — this is probably my favorite part of my job — we’re going to turn the entire face of sports.”

Coon is referring to how the organization is using sensors to collect data on everything from fans’ engagement, to ticket usage, to the performance of the team’s video presentations. At the Nuggets home opener on October 29, 2014, the organization introduced a brand-new ticketing system — a move that’s designed to enhance the fan experience in the 21st century.

Fueling the experience

On a recent tour of the Nuggets’ Pepsi Center, Coon pointed out one key piece of new technology. At the venue’s entrance are two large touchscreen monitors that resemble Google Glass in appearance. However, these are not a wearable tech invention. Instead, these monitors are designed to give fans the ability to quickly scan their UID using the device’s touchscreen keyboard. Coon says that this is a key upgrade to an older approach, which involved the fans scanning their UIDs with a paper clip and then sending the results into a box.

“We wanted to make it faster. We wanted it to be an experience that would make our fan base aware and more importantly to do it in a way where it was actually a different experience, so they’d get used to it. It wasn’t the same old scanner that was there last year,” he says.

While the system doesn’t use facial recognition technology, the system does collect biometric information — that is, the information that represents a person’s physical characteristics (heart rate, respiration, and activity levels). Coon says that this information is recorded and stored to ensure that anyone trying to circumvent the system will be unsuccessful.
