+1 for this thread, thank you so much. Also thanks for accepting this answer and correcting it. (It's not a "fiat-friendly" alternative to IOTA because fiat "must" be involved somewhere down the line, I'm quite sure that even a decentralized money does have a point where the flow of funds has to flow, or the system can't actually maintain stability. It's just very easy to understand that IOTA is the easiest and fairest way to implement any cryptocurrency)



I would definitely have never thought about doing a community-funded IOTA/Bitcoi/Xchain or something like this and the idea of having a fair, open, decentralized cryptocurrency on everyone's phone which should only use the people's energy and not governments or central authorities is the best thing that could have ever happened to all of us in my opinion.



All my best, great work! You actually made me wanna start mining again because I am pretty pissed about this IOTA and cryptocurrency bullshit, it's amazing! Great work, keep it up!



You know, this could potentially work as an alternative to microtransactions, if a lot of people could agree to share their cell phones' energy in order to make the payments (and not use the phone's data service and not use any other mobile-based service besides payments, of course).

+1000 for this

-5 for no explanation for this, and no explanation of why you did this



I have been thinking about how to do things in a sustainable way, I feel like our society is not sustainable because we have to send our energy to distant "authorities" and pay high energy costs and it's very difficult to even start discussing how sustainable this is.



This is a great project and I have faith in humanity.

I'd be happy to help you out in any way that I can. Let me know if you want someone to play the part of the "angel investor." I have already been talking with a few people that I know that are looking for something like this to make our lives easier and more sustainable.

Great work man! +1 (not OP).



Here's some feedback:



The website has a great structure, it's clean and very well-designed. I also like the design of the video.


I will echo much of what the other people have said regarding your video.



You have a great idea, and you're using it to help people, and to make a statement about how businesses treat consumers. Keep it up!



Thank you for your kind words, I will be getting the domain later this week!

I also have a project, it's on GitHub. I was looking for a domain and I saw your project, so I made this thread and figured we could collaborate to get people to work together.

The thing is, if you want the full features of the platform you will need a smartphone. You won't be able to run it on a $4 dollar computer. The price of energy on these phones fluctuate from $0.33 cents to $0.83 cents, which means that the price of each coin is changing depending on how much energy the phone used.

I like your idea, it has a very good structure to it. It doesn't surprise me that you have decided to have a mobile app, as this is a very good idea as well.



You might want to read about some existing projects that are trying to solve these problems.



There is the idea of a carbon credit and having a company (the bank) sell carbon credits. Companies pay the bank for these credits, so there is a price that they have to pay. These credits are actually backed by certificates and the price fluctuates.



Another way that you could have carbon credits, but I don't have enough knowledge on this topic. There is also a way of actually charging people for using electricity, but I can't find any good references on it.



This has been an incredibly educational experience, thanks a lot for doing this!



You're totally right and I don't know anything about this.

There is this blockchain called "Trons" where you can earn money for free. I haven't tried it yet, but this could be an idea you could adopt in the future.

Thanks a lot for your comments, I will be implementing a community pool ASAP!
