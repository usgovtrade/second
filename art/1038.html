Students

Our students are just like you. They are a mixture of students who just want to pursue a degree online and people who need a quality college education in a field where it's hard to find a job.

The majority of our students have been out of school and just trying to get a job and now can't find a decent job to support their family and pay their bills. Their dream is to return to school and get a good degree and now can get the education they need.

I am so glad I found A C.E.O college. I am looking forward to the future that awaits me.

I have a lot of education under my belt. I can hardly believe I passed the accounting course without having to be in a classroom. I feel like I have grown up while at A. C.E.O college. I am a hard worker and I thank God for blessing me with this opportunity to go to college.

A. C.E.O college has made it possible for me to earn my degree with only 18 months to go to finish my degree. It has been so great not having to get into the bus and having to pay for gas. I just want to thank everyone at A. C.E.O college and my online mentor, Dr. Lara.

I will tell you what really has made A. C.E.O college the best online college. It is their dedication to their students. I have been getting great help in my course work, in the way of studying and help with assignments. I just want to thank you and the A. C.E.O staff for making it possible for me to get my education and helping me get a job to pay for school.

I am excited to go back to school and learn. I am looking forward to doing my best in school so I can get my career started. My career is a part of my future and I want to pursue my dreams in school and make a difference in the world. It is an honor to have A. C.E.O College to help me accomplish my goals.

I'm just one of those hard-working people. I have had a lot of experience in a lot of different areas, but I never took the time to learn more. I never took the time to get a college education. I just didn't think it was possible for me. I was wrong. A. C.E.O college has helped me out a lot. They have helped me every step of the way.

Thank you so much. I never thought I would be able to receive a college education online, but A. C.E.O made it possible. You have really made a difference in my life and I will never forget it.

My goal is to have a better life for myself and my family. I am going to take every step that I can to get what I want.

This is the second time I am trying to go to college with online classes. The first time I went to school online my G.E.D was not recognized because of too many absences. I also got behind in my G.E.D classes when I did go to class and the teachers did not have my records so I was just so far behind and it has been a struggle to keep up.

I love A. C.E.O college and my online mentor, Dr. LaRae. I always felt that she really cared about me. I have made friends from all over the world. They are not people that I would normally meet. They have made my days more enjoyable and have helped me become a better person. I know what a struggle it is to get through school with only online courses and being disabled I am trying to go back to school. I need this education so that I can get out of my mom's house and away from her controlling behavior. I am looking forward to spending the rest of my life with my mom, but this is what I have to do to help us out. I don't want to get sick and to stay where I am or have to make it on a little money.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:21
