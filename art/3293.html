“I am not only inspired by but also a huge fan of the film “Gladiator” and for this project, I feel, the spirit and soul of that film is embodied in my music and lyrics. “

The band is fronted by Aditya Tandon, known for his earlier stint as a leading singer in the band ‘Lingaa.’ He later formed the band ‘Aditya with Micky Gagnon’ with whom he performed at the World Music Awards in 2000.

Aditya and his band are considered to be among the few Bollywood musical bands of recent years that have been successful in both Bollywood and in the English music scene. They have created a niche for themselves by combining Indian music with Western rock music.

It was in 2010 that the band released the song ‘Baby Doll.’ The song was composed by guitarist Jasbir Jassi and lyrics were written by singer, lyricist and composer Sameer Anjaan. The song was composed after Jassi heard Tandon’s voice, and then wrote a song around it.

In August 2015, Aditya performed at an event for World of Children and Adults with Cancer, held at the Taj Palace Hotel in New Delhi.

In November 2015, Aditya performed at the ‘Trick or Treat?’, a rock concert that was conducted in Mumbai, Nagpur and Gujarat. In a conversation with Indian Express, Agarwal said, “The music we make is a fusion of Indian and Western music.”

“While we try to blend the Indian and Western musical style, our sound is unmistakably Indian, he said.

Aditya and his band performed at the TEDx Delhi in November 2015, where they performed a number of songs.
