It’s the end of the school holidays! This is our last blog post for 2013 – how quickly it’s passed us by! We hope you’ve all had a fantastic break – we sure did!

As we leave 2013 behind, we also bid farewell to the last of our old friends – the last of our old school and nursery favourites.

Of course, we are far from done for this year – tomorrow, we’ll be back with two brand-new toys and a new selection of books for little monsters and little people. In the meantime, here are the last remnants of some old friends!

First up is our good old friend from school! This fun and colourful clock will keep time very clearly, and will also help your young one remember to get up in the morning! Its stylish red casing and shiny white numbers will be a huge hit for any boy or girl aged 4 or over.

Next up is the best toy we’ve seen all year! Our best friend at nursery has always been an animal – and they’ve gone and bred a whole new type of toy this year, with their new super-adorable baby animals! We’re already thinking about getting a couple of the tiny ones to keep on our desks at work – perhaps they’ll cheer us up during the dull days!

And, finally, we’re leaving you with a monster in its natural habitat! We wouldn’t normally have a problem keeping this little guy in our pockets, but it is not the kind of thing we would normally feature on our website – and it doesn’t stop this cutie, either!

He will be a fantastic Christmas gift for any child who loves monsters!

It’s the start of October, and already we are deep in the Halloween spirit. This time of year always brings a flurry of wonderful costumes and accessories, and we have some great new items to feature in this festive sale.

Our monsters will be out and about, so will need some accessories to complete their fancy dress – and we have just the thing! Our huge selection of monster masks will not only allow your kids to get into character – we have so many monsters in stock at the moment, in fact, they would have to be real monsters not to find one to match!

Our monsters need to eat, too – and what better way to do it than with some tasty fruit. We have a fabulous selection of fruit-based food and drinks that can be used to help with pretend eating games, or as ingredients for delicious homemade pudding!

And if you’re a new parent, or a seasoned veteran, you’ll know all too well how tough it is to find the perfect toy for your child. We have a great selection of fun for kids of all ages, but it would be an injustice if we didn’t leave you with a last gift to make your child smile! A set of soft, fluffy, cuddly toys that will become new favourites in no time.

We can’t wait for Halloween to get here, but we are excited for any child’s birthday, as well!

With the year drawing to a close, and autumn on its way, it’s time for us to start thinking about Christmas shopping. Our selection of Christmas tree decorations will not only go perfect with your tree and Christmas house decorations – they can be used for so many of the little things on your list!

Our teddy bears and dolls will suit any little girl – they are cute and soft, and will also come in the right colours to match our colourful tree decorations!

And if you have any little ones, we have a fantastic selection of toys for them to enjoy, too! From classic toys like building sets and Lego sets, to more unique playthings that are bound to be a hit – like our range of monster masks!

We can’t wait for the start of another year! We’ll be back with new products soon!

Every week our designers create fantastic new products, and every week we sell out!

There’s no getting away from the fact that summer is a whirlwind of fun, but you may find yourself short of activities for little people over the summer. Here are just three ideas to help keep the little ones busy, no matter where you are!

It’s always a tricky thing to get little people involved in something without them having too much fun. This game is packed with challenges, colourful designs and all sorts of other goodies! We have a fabulous collection of board games for your little people to enjoy, so this is bound to be a good one!

How about a little DIY activity? We have a great selection of simple craft kits, with everything your child might need for a quick project. We have the paints, tools and materials that you’ll need to have some fun at home in no time!

This book gives a fun and easy-to-learn guide to making a paper boat. It’s one of the easiest projects around, so it will take a whole load of fun out of the water for a rainy day!

Do you have any other suggestions for activities we should feature in our shop? Let us know in the comments!

Giggles and giggles are everywhere at the moment! Whether it’s from little girls, little boys or even teens, we are in the silly season – and we love it!

The last few months have been filled with silly pictures, funny videos and of course, great moments on TV and film. We’ve seen our favourite cartoons have fun at their fetes, and watched our favourite fairy tales come alive on the big screen. We’ve laughed at some of the shows, and cried at others – but never stop believing in good fun!

And of course, we love to see all this fun, because it means we can get down to the business of bringing you the best range of jokes, funny pictures and everything else you might want to have a chuckle about!

We love our cartoons and our movies, but there’s only so much time in a day! So this month, we have done you a favour – gathered our favourite images and made them into a big batch of funny pictures, cartoons, memes, stickers and anything else you might want.

And because we love giving you the best, we’ve put together our favourite collection of pictures – the perfect bundle of laughs for the school holidays.

First up, is our collection of stickers! It has been a tough week at work – and all we want to do is sit down for a bit with a cup of tea and relax. And who doesn’t want to do that in the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:42
