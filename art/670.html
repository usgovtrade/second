generate electricity, called fuel cells, which is 
less expensive and more efficient than 
traditional power plants using radioactive materials 
like uranium. These new fuel cell plants don't use 
radioactive materials; instead, they use hydrogen 
to generate electricity. In other words, the fuel cells 
use the same fuel we have on hand. 
The hydrogen used in fuel cells comes from water. 
Every element in the periodic table can be combined 
with hydrogen to make a fuel, such as gasoline, 
butane, propane, diesel fuel, or jet fuel. The most 
commonly used fuel today is gasoline, which is made from 
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
But what if we used all the carbon atoms in gasoline 
as fuel to produce electricity? After all, water contains 
carbon and hydrogen in the form of carbon dioxide. 
If we could break apart those carbon dioxide atoms 
and remove the carbon, we would have the hydrogen 
we need to generate electricity. With only water 
and electricity, we could do this! It's so simple 
that I'll illustrate the process on the board. First, 
water is electrolyzed to produce hydrogen, and this 
hydrogen is used to drive a fuel cell, which produces 
electricity. The electricity powers a motor that's 
linked to a generator. The turbine in the generator 
creates electrical power, which the motor then transfers 
back to a power grid. The only input needed to do 
this is water and electricity. Thus, we have a closed 
cycle. A schematic of the process is shown on the right. 
But how do we know if this is possible? Will 
our closed cycle produce electricity at a rate of more 
than the amount of electricity we use? To answer 
this question we can simply use existing processes 
and apply them to our scheme. For instance, we can 
take one gallon of water, place it in a pressurized 
vessel, and heat it to 15,000Â°F. That's a temperature 
sufficient to break apart all the carbon dioxide 
molecules and drive the oxygen atoms out as a gas. 
We could also run electricity through the closed 
circuit to recover that hydrogen from the water. 
In short, it's possible to generate electricity in a 
closed cycle using electricity and hydrogen obtained 
from water.
So, we have discovered a way to take the oxygen 
free carbon that's hiding in carbon dioxide 
and use it to power a generator. Now that we have a 
source of electricity, we need to find a way to use 
it! Some of my research involves making hydrogen 
from electricity, and with hydrogen in hand, we could 
build a fuel cell to produce electricity. Fuel cells are 
more efficient than other forms of power plants, such 
as coal, oil, or natural gas. In addition, fuel cells 
don't require radioactive materials like uranium. 
The fuel cell works by using hydrogen to combine with 
oxygen, and the hydrogen in this case would come 
from water. The electricity from the fuel cell is then 
used to generate more hydrogen to be used again 
by the fuel cell. Thus, the fuel cell can keep converting 
water into hydrogen and electricity, which generates 
more hydrogen, which is then used by the fuel cell to 
generate even more electricity! The flow of electrons is 
shown on the left. In the most common form of fuel cell, 
the hydrogen is separated from the oxygen. This 
is called a proton exchange membrane, or PEM. 
The PEM is essentially a membrane that's made 
of a solid polymer. The hydrogen passes through 
the PEM, but oxygen doesn't. At one end of the 
membrane is an anode that is negatively charged, 
and at the other end is a cathode that is positively 
charged. The anode is typically made of a porous 
metal; the cathode is normally a flat sheet of platinum. 
As the hydrogen travels through the membrane, it 
is forced to the anode side, which turns the hydrogen 
into hydrogen ions. Each hydrogen ion travels 
through the membrane and combines with an 
opposite charged oxygen molecule at the anode, 
where two water molecules are formed. These 
two water molecules then rejoin with the hydrogen 
to form pure water. At the cathode, the hydrogen 
molecules are decomposed, and the electrons are 
released. The electrons from the hydrogen ions then 
flow into the cathode through an external circuit 
made of wires and a generator. Once there, the 
electrons are recombined with the protons and create 
additional hydrogen molecules, which are allowed to 
pass through the membrane. The separation of the 
electrons from the protons is the important part 
of the reaction. When the electrons flow through 
the external circuit, the fuel cell creates a small 
amount of electricity, about 1 watt. This electricity 
can be used to power a computer, which drives a 
light, or to charge a car battery, which powers the 
car.
Let's look at the fuel cell circuit in greater detail 
to see how it works. One of the simplest forms of a 
fuel cell uses only an anode and a cathode. The anode 
is an oxygen electrode made from nickel, cobalt, 
platinum, carbon, or other materials. The cathode 
is a hydrogen electrode, which is usually constructed 
from platinum or palladium. In addition, the cathode 
can also contain platinum nanoparticles. (For this 
tutorial, we will focus on electrodes made from 
platinum.)
Electrons flow from the anode to the cathode 
through a wire. This wire carries electricity that 
drives the reaction of the fuel cell. There are also 
two wires to the water reservoir. The first carries 
water, which flows through the water reservoir and 
the fuel cell at a steady rate. The second wire carries 
hydrogen from the fuel cell to the anode. The wire 
from the anode carries electrons back to the battery 
using a wire. The electron flow drives the protons to 
leave the anode and travel to the cathode. In the 
anode, electrons from the protons and water combine 
with oxygen molecules, creating water, oxygen, and 
additional electrons. The electrons travel through 
a wire and combine with protons in the water at the 
cathode, creating hydrogen ions. These hydrogen 
ions join with electrons to form water. This is a 
simple cycle, which continues until the hydrogen 
source is empty.
But it gets better. Suppose we placed two platinum 
plates directly above each other with a tiny gap 
between them. The platinum surface of one plate is 
placed in a stream of hydrogen, which is pumped from 
a source to the anode. The other plate, which is 
the cathode, has a platinum coating and is connected 
to a source of electrons. Then, a large voltage is 
applied to the two plates, producing an electrical 
current. We see the electrons leaving one plate and 
traveling through the gap to the other plate, where 
they recombine with the hydrogen ions, thus creating 
hydrogen and giving out a small amount of current. 
Then, the electrons and hydrogen ions recombine 
again, creating additional hydrogen and more current. 
This process can continue indefinitely, with each 
plate becoming positively charged until there is no 
more hydrogen on the anode. The final stage occurs 
when the two plates are separated. As the electrons 
and hydrogen ions separate, they move in opposite 
directions with a small amount of electrical current 
and the creation of water and oxygen. The positive 
anode plate becomes increasingly charged as it 
picks up more hydrogen ions. This is the reaction. 
Anode reaction:
2H2O + 2e- -> 2OH- + H2 + 2OH+
Cathode reaction:
H2 + 2OH- -> 2H2O + 2e-
Ion reaction:
2H+ + 2e- -> H2 (H2+ + 2e-)
The ion reaction occurs when water vapor is released 
from hydrogen and combines with electrons to form 
hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ions move in the opposite 
direction as electrons, and the electrons move along 
the cathode in the same direction as the ions. In 
other words, the electrons flow through the wire to 
the battery, while the hydrogen ions and water vapor 
flow from the battery to the anode. As the current 
flows through the wire, some electrons recombine 
with the hydrogen ions, creating more hydrogen and 
some water. But, this process is less common than 
when the electrons and hydrogen ions recombine 
to form water, which is also an electrochemical 
reaction.
The rate of an electrochemical reaction depends 
upon several parameters. The rate is determined 
by the nature of the reactants, rate-limiting steps, 
reaction surface area, surface diffusion, and catalyst. 
Electrochemical reactions are either homogeneous 
or heterogeneous. Homogeneous</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:53
