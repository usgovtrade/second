A full trailer has been released.

Directed by Douglas Camfield, “Kinda” features the Doctor meeting an alien time traveller, and his mission to find his wife, in the world of the London Blitz.

“The most amazing and exhilarating day I’ve had in the BBC studios,” said Baker in a statement. “We were all just kids in Doctor Who back then — which is why the magic still works.”

The three-parter is being produced by BBC Cymru Wales in association with Mammoth Screen and BBC Worldwide, and will air on BBC One, with new and returning cast members joining Baker and Jameson.

The drama is set to kick off the new series on New Year’s Day.

The BBC also confirmed today the cast of Christmas Special “Last Christmas,” featuring David Tennant as the Doctor and Billie Piper.

“David Tennant as the Doctor has given us everything we could have hoped for and more,” said Head of Drama Ben Stephenson. “Billie, on the other hand, is an amazing and original discovery and it’s great that we have such a star of her talent here.”

The Christmas Special will be directed by Graeme Harper, who also helmed Tennant’s final episode “The End of Time.”

Fans of the series will be able to access the episode as part of BBC iPlayer’s “Doctor Who: The Ultimate Fan Boxset,” on sale Monday 23 October.

The “Boxset” will contain the full Doctor Who experience for £9.99. The pre-release offer of the 50th Anniversary celebrations of Doctor Who will begin on Friday 19 October. A variety of Doctor Who t-shirts and Doctor Who logo items will also be available, priced at £10 each.

On Monday 18 October, the BBC also launched its new Doctor Who web page – the first dedicated website for the show since it went off air in 1989.

For the first time since its return, fans will be able to access all the previous trailers, audio clips and clips online.

The new webpage will also feature behind-the-scenes footage and exclusive Doctor Who content, as well as the ability for users to access exclusive videos from the new TV series with their Doctor Who 50th Anniversary badge on Facebook and the BBC’s official Twitter page.

The BBC has also launched a dedicated hashtag #DOCTORWHO to coincide with the new series.

Tweets mentioning “Doctor Who” and using #DOCTORWHO will automatically get a picture of the new Doctor Who Doctor from the trailer, Matt Smith’s TARDIS, or the Eleventh Doctor, overlaid in gold on their Twitter feed.

On Saturday 20 October, “Doctor Who” star Matt Smith will kick off the BBC’s Big 50 celebrations with a live performance of “A Christmas Carol,” at London’s Royal Albert Hall, just two weeks after filming wrapped on the new series.

There will also be a Doctor Who Experience in London, which will open on 5 November and run for two years. It will be “a multi-sensory journey” through the history of Doctor Who and will take fans through “the heart of the mythical Baker Street,” a “time vortex” with “a secret destination” and a TARDIS. It will have life size props, original costumes, an interactive exhibition, a bar and café.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:26
