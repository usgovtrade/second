"Hey, you!" "Hey, that's my hat." "Hey!" "My beautiful marmalade!" "You have found me." "It can't be no one else." "I don't know what they're talking about, but it sounds like nonsense to me." "Listen." "You don't understand the power of this here charm." "This is no ordinary hat, my dearie." "If you know what I mean by that." "Oh, but I do." "I really do." " You know what I'm saying?" " Yes." "But I don't believe in that stuff." "I'll prove it to you." "What?" "You'll marry me?" "That is some tall talk, friend." "Well, I mean it." "Oh, darling." "Oh, darling." "Do you think you can find a more gorgeous guy anywhere in the whole world?" "Yes, and when I do, I will." "Oh, well, I hope he's richer than I am." "Well, we're sure going to have a wonderful time in the convent." "That's a laugh." "In the convent?" "Well, are you gonna take me or not?" "Sure." "Oh, why not?" "Well, one big man can fix another." "Oh." "Come on, baby." "Oh, my." "Oh, come on, baby." "We gotta have a little walkie." "Well, I've never had a walkie before." "Okay, I'll show you how to have a walkie." "You got an old towel or something?" "You heard the man, Sister Superior." "She's a sinner." "We can't let her in." "Well, she's a human being." "What do you mean?" "Well, she's gonna be our mother and your father." "She looks human, and she wants to join us." "Well, we don't need to wait for God to decide that." "We can decide it ourselves." "You mean you are going to take her in?" "I am." "Sister Superior, this woman is a liar and a sinner." "Don't make any mistakes about that." "Don't you dare call me a liar." "Let me see your face." "I don't have to show it to you." "Just come up close." "Now you're gonna see what kind of a woman you're gonna meet." "Come on, baby." "What are you doing?" "Where are you going?" "Get her!" "Hold her down!" "I'm in an awful hurry!" "Please, I gotta go!" "Oh, don't leave me." "Oh, please." "Please." "Don't leave me." "I'm a sinner!" "Don't leave me!" "I don't wanna go to hell!" "I don't wanna go to hell!" "Oh!" "You!" "Let go of me!" "Let go!" "Let go of me!" "Don't you dare hurt my baby!" "Don't you dare hurt my baby!" "Let go!" "What's going on?" "There's been a fight." "Where's Babe?" "She ran out." "We'll get her." "Let's get her." "Oh, my." "Get her, get her, get her." "I wanna make sure she don't break her neck." "Who is it?" "Oh, it's me." "How dare you come in here in your bare feet?" "Look at your legs." "Look at your nose." "You have no respect for anything." "Now, get out of here." "I'm sorry, but I'm having my period." "I just wanted to ask you something." "Oh, it's you." "Go in and wash up." "I want you to watch how I prepare this soup and then copy me." "I've got a book here somewhere on the mysteries of cooking." "Cooking, cooking." "All right, go in and wash up." "Oh, what's the matter with you?" "I have to go." "I have to go to the market." "You don't want me to go with you?" "No, I'm going on business." "What do you want?" "What do you mean what do I want?" "Well, what do you want from me?" "What's the matter with me?" "You're such a fine woman." "My poor husband couldn't have come up with anyone better." "And he loved you so much." "You're a mystery." "You're like a little boy to me." "Oh, come on." "Tell me what you want." "Oh, God." "You're right." "Let me think." "What am I thinking about?" "I'm so damn rich." "Oh, but it all looks so awful." "Don't touch it." "Look, put this on, will you?" "That's a pretty hat." "I could have gone to the market in this." "No, I want you to look like a nice young lady." "I'll wear one of these." "Oh, that's a beautiful hat." "That hat looks good on you." " You like it?" " Yeah." "I think it looks better than the other one." "Let's try it on." "Wait a minute." "Not this time." "You don't want me to wear this hat, do you?" "I bought it for you." "You don't like it anymore than I do." "I don't know how I can buy anything for you that you don't like." "Oh, it's no use." "I think it looks very nice on you." "Now, listen." "I want you to look very nice." "Don't use that old phrase like you used with my husband." "You're making me feel cheap." "I don't want you to be cheap." "I want you to be happy." "I don't want you to be happy." "Well, then I can't do anything right." "Oh, no." "Don't say that." "You don't understand anything." "What's the matter?" "This looks bad." "What's wrong with it?" "You always bought me that kind of hat." "I hate it." "I hate it." "You hate it?" "My husband loved it, and I'm still wearing it." "Hey, look out." "You're spilling everything." "I think you better leave, you're not very nice to me, anyway." "You hate it." "You hate it." "No, I don't." "I really don't." "You hate it." "All right, leave the hat on." "Now I feel as if I'm cheating on him." "As if he can see me." "Oh, I won't wear that hat." "You want me to wear it?" "Yes." "Yes." "Yes." " No!" " Yes." "Yes." "Here." "Take your hands off." "There, that's better." "Oh, no!" "No!" "Oh, please!" "Oh, please!" "Please!" "No!" "No!" "No!" "Please don't!" "No!" "No!" "No!" "No!" "Please!" "No!" "Leave me alone!" "Please!" "Please!" "No, I don't want it." "Please, leave me alone." "Oh, no!" "Let me go!" "Please, no, I don't want it!" " Please, leave me alone!" " No, I don't want it!" " Oh, no!" " Leave me alone!" " Leave me alone!" " Leave me alone!" "Leave me alone!" "Leave me alone!" "Leave me alone!" "Oh, please." "Please, please." "Please, no!" "No!" "No, I don't want it!" "Leave me alone." "Please, leave me alone!" "No!" "No!" "No!" "Don't!" "No, leave me alone!" "Leave me alone!" "Leave me alone!" "Leave me alone." "Oh, please, please." "Please, no!" "No, no!" "No, I don't want it." "I don't want it." "No!" "No!" "No!" "No!" "No!" " No!" " No, I don't want it." " No, no, no, no." " Please, leave me alone!" "No!" "No!" "No!" "Leave me alone!" "Oh, please." "Please." "Please, no!" "Don't leave me!" "Please!" "Please, no!" "No, I don't want it." "I don't want it." "Don't, please, leave me alone!" "No, I don't want it!" "Oh, please!" "Don't leave me!" "Leave me alone!" "Don't leave me alone!" "Please!" "Leave me alone!" "Please!" "No!" "Leave me alone!" "Please, please." "Please, no." "Leave me alone." " Leave me alone!" " Leave me alone!"
