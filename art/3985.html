It is unacceptable,” Westerman said. “We would ask the people to please be patient with us because we are new to this and we are going to do the best we can for you.”

In addition to working on an official name for the bar, Westerman said the board would likely need to look into hiring an attorney and a CPA.

The board would also likely have to meet with neighbors to listen to their concerns, Westerman said.

The board plans to meet with neighbors on May 21 at 10 a.m. in the gymnasium at 705 Main St. to present the results of their research. They have also decided to post a flier about the new development in front of 845 Main St., a neighbor’s house.

Westerman said if neighbors are “wondering how this could have been permitted without them knowing about it, there are people out there who can answer that question.”

Westerman said she wants to give the neighbors a chance to speak. “We want to understand what people are saying,” she said.

The board plans to meet again May 31 to discuss the bar’s ownership group, Westerman said.
