What is SELFEGGIO broadcasting?

Frequency channels are assigned specific UHF frequencies, just like any other radio station. Because SELFEGGIO is licensed to broadcast in your area, it will broadcast on a specific UHF frequency. Channels are allocated to specific radio stations by the Federal Communications Commission. The radio station is known by their channel number.

Do all channels share one frequency?

Yes. All UHF channels are only allowed to use the designated frequencies that are assigned to them. For the radio station to broadcast, it will use a frequency that is allocated to it. All of the channels that are registered with the FCC are limited to only use the frequency that they are allocated. For example, channel 11 cannot broadcast using a channel that has already been assigned to another station. The broadcast frequency for channel 11 is reserved exclusively for it and the FCC is responsible for ensuring that it is only used by channel 11.

Choosing a broadcasting frequency is a crucial step when it comes to setting up your radio broadcast. If you are selecting the best broadcasting frequency, you will need to consider the surrounding area and population density. If you are choosing a small broadcasting frequency, you should also look at the different bands used by the broadcasting company. These bands can range from low frequency bands up to megahertz frequencies. Choosing the best broadcasting frequency is crucial, as the selection is a reflection of your business and its target audience.

Do I need to select a SELFEGGIO channel?
