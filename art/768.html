enhance EnronOnline prices.  It has been used in the past by one of our largest 
customers, Aquila, and by us for several months.  It's simply the addition of 
'auto-decrease' to our prices based on competitive offers from other 
providers.  By decreasing the price in this manner, we stimulate the 
competition.

The method is as follows.  Let's assume it's May 1st and you submitted a price 
to us on January 31st.  The auto-decrease begins on May 2nd.  On that date we 
look for competitive offers from other providers for that product.  If we 
find one at a lower price than our price, we simply decrease our price to the 
competitive offer.  This continues throughout the month.  On June 1st, the 
price is auto-decreased again.

How does this impact the margin and Enron's profit? 
 - It creates additional competition, with the desired result of lowering 
prices.
 - It is a downward adjustment, so margins and profit will be greater than 
under the fixed price. 
- It transfers the risk from the supplier (Enron) to the customer (Aquila) 
- We are no longer at risk of being the only mark-up, i.e. the 'inventory 
risk', and this is a key issue with mark-ups, since the risk is assumed 
entirely by Enron. 
- Enron receives the largest part of the margin.
