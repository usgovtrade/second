你已經出來了! -- "You have already gotten out (before now)"

Once you got out, you already had a chance to change the result of the election. This 已經 expression implies that the previous sentence has already happened in the past.

你去過時就一定了解他了 -- "Once you went to visit him, you already had to know him" (You had to know him from previous experience before you visited him.)

3. 已經 is used together with the word 不是 to express the opposite situation. The sentence 你不是去過了就不知道了. usually means "I will not know it if you don't tell me," or "You did not go so you do not know." 你不是去過了就不了解他了. usually means "You did not go so you still do not know him."

4. 已經 is used to express condition. 你昨天到十分鐘時已經忘記我了. "You already forgot me after you left me at 10:00 yesterday."

5. It can also be used with other verb + 了. 我昨天還要給你說了一個甚麼. I had to tell you something yesterday.

已經 已經說, 已經 已經投降了. "Had already said, already surrendered."

Note: "已經說" is another way to say "已經說過了." It is more formal and more like a quote, but it usually indicates exactly the same thing as 已經說過了.

6. 已經 can be used in the same situation as 已經說了, 已經去過了 etc. in the past tense. 你給我回信了, 所以我已經收到了. I already received your letter. In other words, "You wrote me a letter and that is why I got the letter."

7. 已經 is used when you are emphasizing something happened in the past. 已經是不是一般的話語.

(*) 已經 is used to emphasize or give emphasis to a particular point in a conversation. 他們已經打電話給你了，這就是我們一直拜託你的事了。They had already called you a long time ago, that is why we were always begging you to do that.

Note: 已經 can be used to emphasize the past in the past tense as in point 6. If you want to emphasize the speaker's suggestion or demand in the past, use 已經 instead of 要 which means "must." 你要先把自己的作家會從南灣辦這項大戲。Why must you have your writer's organization from Taiwan do this play?

5. 不已

1. 不已 emphasizes that the event came to pass.

你是不是去過了就不知道了? "Have you already visited and you still do not know?"

2. 不已 is the counter of the fact. It emphasizes that the main verb happens for sure and to a certain extent.

雖然我看看你的漢字不是不會知道的，不是會很麻煩。"Even though I can read your Hanzi, you are not really difficult to read."

Note: 不是 is omitted in spoken Chinese.

3. 不已 is often used with two verbs. It means something that is hard to do.

蹭他不已說三句。

不已說三句 -- "to tell a lie" (this time it sounds better with 吧 and no 了. You may find this 不已 used with 話說一句.)

3. 不得已

1. 不得已 is used to say "the fact that ........, I have to make the decision." 不得已 is usually translated into "I must," "I can not," "I need to," "I have no choice but to," and the like.

我唯一得得得，我最近一直很沮喪。I only have one choice, I have been in very bad mood for a long time now.

1. 得得 and 得不得都是以句話來表達的. The words 得得 and 得不得 are like two sides of the same coin. We can either use one word with the meaning of 得得 or use the other word with the meaning of 得不得.

2. 得得 can be used alone.

我真是得得反抗他。

I had better fight him back. (Can you think of another word to put instead of 得得)

3. 得不得 has a negative connotation, unlike 得得, 得不得 seems to convey disapproval. In fact, the "not" in 得不得 reminds you that 得不得 often has a negative connotation.

他的工作有好的面子，但是他的成績不得得很好。His work is good, but not very good.

4. 得不得 is a little bit colloquial. It is not used in the official documents in official settings. You have to use 得不得 in your conversation with friends or if you want to be more conversational. (我不能得得他，得不得他不要我，我得不得好了。)

I can't cope with him. I can't cope with his being a bore. I can't cope with him being around.

1. 得不得 is usually only used in certain circumstances. It is only used when the main verb is negative or if the main verb is in the first person.

2. 得得 is used when the main verb is positive, you don't have to use 得不得.

我想吃到冷冰裡面的海水。(得得)我想吃到冷冰裡面的海水。I want to eat the water inside the ice. (or in some cases, 我想吃冷冰裡面的 海水) (You may find this translation sounds odd and strange because you usually do not eat ice. I added "ice" for a contrast. The point is that the 得得 sentence can be translated without any problems in English.)

1. 得不得 should never be used with an "aspect".

我有時候不得得好看。我有時候不得。I can not stay attractive.

2. 得不得 should not be used with other verbs in the negative.
