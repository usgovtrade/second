Basically saying that some things are better left unexplored, especially when it comes to the mysteries of the universe.

With that, Dr. Jones said that in his opinion, there should not be further space missions for the foreseeable future. He then went on to mention the tragic death of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who is noted as being the first human to leave the gravitational pull of our home planet. Gagarin's life was cut short when the parachute for his Venera-D vehicle failed to open during re-entry. Dr. Jones pointed out that we should not risk our lives in outer space when we cannot even fully explore our own home planet.

With that, Dr. Jones said that the Japanese government should not waste taxpayer money on yet another attempt to visit the planet Mars. There are other more pressing things for the Japanese people to focus on, like their home planet. Japan's last attempt to orbit Mars was met with failure when a malfunctioning attitude control thrust motor caused the craft to deviate from its intended orbital path. One source stated that following the failure of the spacecraft, the government is planning to allocate a new space craft to the country's JAXA agency so it can better contribute to space exploration.

It's not often we hear of the government wasting taxpayer money on this, but this time, it really seems to be justified. We already have the moon, earth, Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn in our celestial neighborhood. That alone should be enough for us to experience for the foreseeable future.

That's not to say we won't try again at some point in the future, but it would seem to be far more reasonable to focus on the one planet we have a lot of data from and use the results of those missions to further refine our exploration of space. When we look at other countries, we can see that the U.S.S.R. and China have only explored the moon while the former has had little success with their Mars rovers. As they see what we have to look at, we can help them with their own endeavors.

There is also the issue of cost. A Mars flyby mission and its return trip would require a crew of four, a massive ship to support the mission, and hundreds of millions of dollars to get it ready and sent off. Dr. Jones estimated that for about five hundred million, you could have a small shuttle that could explore Mars in addition to a couple of deep space vehicles that could explore the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. One of these deep space vehicles could also visit an asteroid, while the other would observe other planets. These missions would give us more information for the sake of science, which is why I consider this to be one of the best reasons to not explore space right now.

We simply have a lot of other issues right here on our own planet. The U.S.S.R. has already focused more on Russia, which many would claim makes them more than capable of exploring Mars at this time. But we have this little space thing called China that's been going full speed ahead in space exploration since 2010. The country has already sent a probe to orbit Venus, a manned lunar orbiter, and two lunar probes. We already have enough for China, but if the Russians can focus on their own country and their own needs, why do we have to do the same thing?

You might say that the U.S. is more stable than Russia, but I would call that bullshit. This is more of a "we have our own issues to attend to" sort of thing. Russia has spent money on other programs and has focused on their own space program and economy. If we can keep the U.S. from taking focus away from our own government and military, then I see no reason why we need to spend the money ourselves. It seems to be a good use of our money to me.

It's also great to see the U.S. join the bandwagon in this sense, because up until now, the U.S. was the only space faring nation without the ability to touch the outer planets and other heavenly bodies. It's been a while since we focused on our own planet and explored every inch of it. That seems like a good use of our money as well.

The people of Japan need a break after the failure of the Japanese Mars probe. Hopefully, they will heed Dr. Jones' words and not focus on outer space while they're already exploring their own planet. Space should remain a mystery.

I haven't been in a gym for years, but the news was disturbing. A man walked into a fitness center in Florida, went to the weight lifting area, grabbed a dumbbell and a steel barbell, and then proceeded to commit suicide. Before he could even push the dumbbell over the weight bars he was found dead.

The incident was rather sad, but I don't think it's such a big deal. I mean, the man only died by his own hand after all. No one else had anything to do with his death, and if he was determined to kill himself, I wouldn't blame anyone for doing so. But I just don't understand the need to kill yourself in the gym to do so. I know it's not as simple as grabbing a gun and shooting yourself, but I also feel that not only is it not a reason to try and commit suicide, it's really not a reason at all to kill yourself.

I know most fitness centers have lifeguards present to watch over the members, but there is no guarantee that they are monitoring every area of the facility all of the time. Sure, there are lifeguards all over the ocean that look after the people swimming there, but no one swims in the middle of the ocean or near the water's edge. If you did, you're an idiot and the lifeguard should refuse to let you go in the water. The fact of the matter is that not all lifeguards are perfect, and we have learned to accept the risks of accidents. We don't hold them responsible for our own deaths or injuries.

That's not to say there aren't lifeguards who take their jobs too seriously and cause problems by trying to "save" people from drowning or otherwise, but they are in the minority. I feel if you commit suicide in the gym, the staff should let you do so and they shouldn't be punished or charged with causing your death. If anyone else has any information about this incident, I would like to hear about it. It seems that my first impressions of this were wrong, so I am open to hearing more about it and learning from it. I would also like to hear why I am wrong, so I am open to suggestions on that front too.

If the majority of people who died by suicide at the gym were healthy and had the ability to live, then I think they would have remained alive and well. There is a reason I try to remain alive and healthy. I don't know what it is, but that's the reason I have for fighting to make it through life. I don't know what motivates someone to try to end their life, but I suspect it's more personal than most other reasons. I do know that even if you have issues with your life, your mental state, and your overall health, that does not give others the right to die on your behalf or kill themselves at the gym.

This probably doesn't even matter. In all likelihood, we'll see more similar suicides in the gym and elsewhere in the future. I hope not, but as the days go by, I don't think it will happen. That's not the case for someone who has lost a spouse or significant other. I suspect there are several who are currently grieving their loss in the gym. I wonder if</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:30
