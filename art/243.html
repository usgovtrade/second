Our story begins with a mysterious creature who has become known as Mr. Big (M.B.). He is not a human. And he has created a plan, which he is carrying out with the help of an accomplice (F.O.), for humanity.

Chapter 2.  Mr. Big’s plan is to be carried out with the help of two partners. Both of them have been living inside human bodies for thousands of years. One of them (F.O.) is an old friend and confidant (G.C.). The other one (M.B.) is a younger friend (A.M.).

Chapter 3.  At the same time, Mr. Big’s plan reaches its peak. An entire country, including the most talented young politicians, was infected by his plan. But there is a young politician who has already found out his secret. He is not going to give up until he finds him and kills him.

Chapter 4.  The first step of the Plan is to become president of the country and destroy everyone who may spoil his plan. It is already carried out. But the new president is still working in secret.

Chapter 5.  Some of the political party members and a group of young politicians are preparing to organize a counter-coup. Their plan is also a step in Mr. Big’s plan, for he does not like young politicians. The most successful plan will not be carried out.

Chapter 6.  During the operation of the Plan, Mr. Big, after discovering one of his allies, enters a fight against the young politicians, as the only one who is able to eliminate the president. The young politician who has already found out about the Plan is the most persistent in the counter-coup, which is not carried out as a result.

Chapter 7.  The president plans to retire and the country is in a state of transition. But during his retirement he sends one of the most brilliant police investigators to find out more about Mr. Big and his accomplice. The investigator is a man who already knows how the world was created and how it works. But that is not enough for Mr. Big.

Chapter 8. The investigation is already being carried out. The investigator has received evidence about Mr. Big. He now knows the identity of the hidden. He also knows who he is.

Chapter 9. The whole country is still investigating Mr. Big. The new president who is now in charge of everything hopes to find Mr. Big’s most dangerous supporter.

Chapter 10. He does not want Mr. Big, his biggest supporter, to finish his plan. And if he is caught, everything will be over. Because if he is caught, he will become a traitor and become completely defenseless. He also takes his supporters and allies with him to his hideout.

Chapter 11. At the beginning, the head of the security office, along with his accomplices, does not know what to do with the latest evidence he has received.

Chapter 12. The country has been very disturbed because of what is happening. And everywhere there is a desire to find the truth behind the political crisis. And finally, the results of the operation are known. The country is waiting for a final decision. And Mr. Big has already been discovered.

Chapter 13. Mr. Big does not wait. He tries to run away. He finds himself in a huge mess. Everything around him is destroyed. And he is now trapped. But he is still a great politician. He comes up with a new plan. He will start a war against the humans. But his plan will come to an end. The plan will end before it is even carried out. The plan was destroyed from within.

Chapter 14. The truth is revealed. Mr. Big is the only one who knows who he is. There is no need to explain more. The young man who has found out Mr. Big’s plan is now with him. He must now do everything that he can to ensure the safety of Mr. Big’s identity. And the final step of the plan is the last act of Mr. Big.

Chapter 15. Mr. Big takes responsibility for what he has done. The plan is finished. Now Mr. Big’s goal is different. He needs to complete it, for someone is looking for him.

Chapter 16. This chapter is important for those who have already found out who Mr. Big is. They need to carry out the final step of the plan. It can destroy everything. Everything.

Chapter 17. Mr. Big’s identity is discovered. But he is still alive. The counter-coup is underway. All the young politicians must first decide what they will do and what their next step will be. A single decision by one young politician can change everything.

Chapter 18. Everything has been accomplished. The counter-coup has been carried out. They are looking for Mr. Big. But he is in a difficult position.

Chapter 19. Mr. Big’s greatest enemy is finally discovered. There is only one way to stop the plan.

Chapter 20. Mr. Big will start a war. He has a plan that is completely different from his own. One of his partners will be the only one to win. They do not like each other at all.

Chapter 21. Mr. Big and his allies fight against the humans. They will destroy everything. The outcome is uncertain. The end of the war is near.

Chapter 22. With great effort and determination, the president and his team prepare to fight against Mr. Big’s human allies. And after all this, Mr. Big may be the only one left. The counter-coup is over. Everything has been destroyed. Now the young politician will have to find a place to hide. He will have to find a place to hide where he can wait for everything to go back to normal.

Chapter 23. The final chapter. The greatest problem that will be encountered by the country is the lack of water. The water sources will become the object of all their attention. It is very likely that one of the most secret locations will become the right place.

Chapter 24. Mr. Big finds himself in the deepest hiding place he has ever been. There he will start another plan. His plan, of course, is the end of all his plans.

Chapter 25. If the last chapter was about the final destruction of Mr. Big, then this chapter is about his return. The last chapter is the end of Mr. Big’s mission. This is the last time, for now, that the young politician, who is very lucky, must protect Mr. Big. Or maybe Mr. Big will be killed.

Chapter 26. The young politician once again hides in the forest. He is waiting for the arrival of Mr. Big. And Mr. Big is watching his arrival with excitement. Mr. Big was never going to give up on everything, even if there was danger around him. He has survived many dangers throughout his life. The next part will bring many surprises.

Chapter 27. The fight begins. And at the end of it, the young politician sees Mr. Big arrive. He quickly decides to capture him at any cost. He will use him to destroy all his enemies. But this will not be the last fight. And a war will begin in the forest, a war for the future of all humans.

Chapter 28. The plan begins. And the final task is carried out. The young politician continues his war against the humans. He will begin with Mr. Big. He will do everything to keep him alive. Even if he loses his own life. He will carry out his mission until the end. And he will succeed.

Chapter 29. The young politician will do everything he has been instructed to do. He must complete everything. Nothing can be changed. Everything must come to an end. But Mr. Big has a last trick that will ensure everything he has dreamed of until now.

Chapter 30. The last chapter has finally arrived. The war against Mr. Big has now come to an end. He never realized that he would destroy his own friends. One will not have the time to enjoy what they have done. They will lose the fight against the enemy. And the war will return to the secret locations. The war will be fought once again. And it will be a war that will be fought by humans.

Chapter 31. The last part of the story begins. The young politician will no longer have to carry out anything. He will not do anything else for Mr. Big. There is one thing he needs</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:18
