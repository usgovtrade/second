I feel like the right kind of couple can always be spontaneous. Whether it’s the first time or not, I feel like those two should just hop on a plane and go on a honeymoon. I think it’s like an adventurous and awesome idea because once you’re together, you want to keep doing new things all the time, like go on crazy adventures and go to all the cool places.

Do you have any exciting and new places to go that you can’t wait to explore together?

Aha! I am a foodie and I love food shopping, so of course there’s so many places. I love the shopping in downtown Vancouver and I love all the farmer’s markets. I’m like obsessed with their markets, so I can’t even express how excited I am to go down there.

Oh, what kind of food are you looking forward to trying out in Vancouver?

I think fish tacos and the local cuisine. That’s all I can think of. I’m addicted to seafood.

I see you have a habit of saying the word “yeah” a lot. Is that a habit of yours since you live in New York? Or is it something that you picked up when you went to school there?

Yeah, that’s something I got from school. In New York, people use that in conversations more often than in the west coast. When I went to NYU, I think everyone said “yeah” in every single conversation and I love it because I love spontaneity.

It kind of just reminds me of people from the New York that speak fast, like, “Yeah yeah yeah yeah.”

I know, right? I’m always used to that. I use to get so mad about that. When I go to school in NYU, if I had to take a class alone, I would probably just have to skip because I can’t follow people. Like when you hear people are talking and everyone is like “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,” and you can’t even keep up. It’s always a lot of conversations, it’s like, “No, no, no, no, no, no.” It’s like a blur.

Right. It’s very hectic and it makes it more difficult for you to keep up and pay attention.

Yeah, exactly. But I love it. It’s really interesting. I always talk about it to my friends and they’re just like “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” and I’m just like “Oh, my God.” That’s one of my New York secrets.

The fact that you said you love when people do that is a huge surprise to me because you know what? I personally didn’t do that when I lived in New York. I would love it if someone did that.

It’s good. It’s the cool thing to do to say yeah in New York, but yeah I love it and, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Awesome. So now that you’ve settled into Vancouver a bit more, is there anything you want to say to your New York City friends who haven’t come visit yet? Like, how are they going to feel if they’re here? Is there anything you want them to know?

No, I actually feel like it’s one of my goals to go back to New York as soon as possible. I’m going back every three months, so you should definitely come with me and see my city and have fun and have crazy times in New York.

Okay, great.

Right. Now, I’m just like a local but I feel like I have never experienced New York when I was in New York. So once I get back to New York, I feel like there’s so much to do.

Great, okay. So you love to go grocery shopping. Have you been to Trader Joe’s yet?

No, I haven’t, actually. I’m actually so excited to go there. I love those. I’m really obsessed with Trader Joe’s and all the grocery stores. I love to go to Whole Foods and Sprouts and Safeway. I love the cheese section in the grocery stores.

Wow, that’s so good. I love cheese. I’m going to visit some places soon too. I might go to Trader Joe’s too. So I’m very excited about it.

Yeah, yeah, it is so amazing. Yeah, it’s a lot of fun.

Yeah, we have Trader Joe’s here in Vancouver. I went there and got a bunch of things.

We have different products here. If you guys go to the grocery store, you can actually buy something from like, you know, a grocery store in the States because it’s a different selection here.

I love it. It’s very interesting and different. That’s so cool.

So if you could go to Trader Joe’s in Vancouver, which products or items do you think you’d pick up?

Like, anything. It’s fun because it’s one of those places where you can actually pick up a lot of stuff. It’s very easy to shop there. All the products are amazing. You can get a whole lot of food and stuff and it’s cheap and easy. You can’t go wrong.

Okay, great. Awesome. So you love New York, you love Trader Joe’s, what about coffee? You really like coffee, huh? Do you have a favorite type?

I do like Starbucks and I love that I don’t have to go to a place if I just want to walk up and buy a coffee or anything, so that’s a fun thing about it.

That’s so cool.

Yeah.

Oh, you have a blog. Did you just write it yourself, or did you have any help with the blog at all?

It was a collaboration, so the owner of Wandering Gourmand helps me out with my blog and I help her with her blog and that’s how it started. We did like a collaboration, so she’s in the UK, so we help each other out with our blogs and then she gave me her website and I gave her my website. We made it into one blog.

That’s awesome. And I just wanted to make sure before we said goodbye, did you want to say anything to your other fans that you have on Instagram?

Yeah, no, I don’t have that much followers and I’m very new to Instagram, so this is the first time that I’m doing Instagram and blogging, so I’m just trying to figure it out and figure out what’s going to happen. My Instagram followers don’t know that I do this or anything.

Well, that’s a great thing. You just got your wedding license last week so I know how nervous you were. But I think you’re doing amazing. You’ve got a lot of really cool followers on Instagram already. And in a little bit, I want to send you an invite to the contest. We’re going to give the winner and airfare, hotel, everything. So keep working hard and your number one fan would love to see you when you come to LA. So thanks for hanging out with me today, it was so nice. It was great to talk to you, and I’m excited to see what’s going to happen in the future.

Oh, thank you so much, and hopefully I’ll see you in LA when I go back and visit, so I’ll be able to visit you as well.

Cool, great. I’ll be at home, waiting for you. I’m so excited for my trip. I’m going to be at least twice a week, every weekend or every week. It’s going to be a lot of fun and then come see you and then we can chill. We’re going to have a lot of fun, so you’re going to be glad that you came to LA.

Alright, man, have fun.

Thank you so much, Sarah. I appreciate you. I’ll definitely visit you in LA.

Thank you.

It’s going to be so fun.

See you in LA.

Alright.

You are so cute, Sarah.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:27
