the commercial imperative to use that technology to enhance our 
position and grow our business in the changing energy marketplace.
This is the second of a series of articles reviewing the application 
of the new technology to the oil and gas industry.

In the first article, the application of the technology to the upstream 
industry was described, including a description of the current 
opportunity in this fast-growing area and the technical and 
commercial challenges. In that article, John Hofmeister, president, 
Halliburton Energy Services, emphasized the importance of 
developing a technology that "works the first time for the right 
marketplace at the right time in an energy-competitive world."

Later in the year, more articles will describe the deployment of the 
SHE technology to other markets, including gas gathering and 
processing and downstream industries.

The Future of the Industry 
While the oil industry is cyclical, the rate of change of technology 
driven by the industry's need to continue to produce, transport 
and refine oil and gas faster and more economically presents 
tremendous business opportunity for the years ahead. In the last few 
years, we have seen the development of microturbines, 
combined-cycle generation, gas processing and gathering, 
interactive drilling and production, and data acquisition and 
management solutions for the oil and gas industry. These developments 
may make us realize the full potential of the industry and 
provide opportunity for us to continue to grow with it. 
Oil and gas production can be enhanced with new technologies, 
but these new technologies can only provide incremental value 
with new and existing facilities. To fully realize the industry's 
growth potential, new technologies will have to be integrated into 
existing facilities in some manner. 
Halliburton plans to be in the vanguard of this next stage of the 
industry's growth. In fact, our own need for innovation and 
technology development has accelerated in recent years. Some of the 
key areas Halliburton is focusing its attention on include:
- Improving its information technology 
- Exploring technologies to enable new business 
opportunities by making more information available on-line 
and at remote well sites.
- Bringing together new products for drilling and production, 
such as hydraulic jars and the Multistage Drilling Process, 
and other technologies that integrate equipment and 
components with new functionality for customers.
- Creating technologies for gas gathering and processing 
that will use lower costs and new technology to drive 
the next evolution of the industry.

- Creating technologies to protect the environment
and minimize its impact as the drilling and production 
operations move into areas previously inaccessible to humans. 
- Applying such technologies to enhance its products and 
services, such as cementing, completion and production 
technology, casing and drilling.

Halliburton's investment in technology development is an 
investment in our own future. In the long run, we plan to emerge as 
the provider of a more productive, more secure and more environmentally 
friendly source of energy than is available today.

HALLIBURTON TO ACQUIRE OILFIELD SERVICES COMPANY

Halliburton and Baker Hughes announced today that they have signed 
an agreement for Halliburton to purchase substantially all of the 
stock of Baker Hughes' oilfield services company for about $7.1 
billion in cash. The agreement also provides that Baker Hughes will 
acquire a significant portion of Halliburton's natural gas 
gathering and production business for stock. Under the terms of the 
agreement, Halliburton shareholders will own between 54% and 57% 
of the combined company, and Baker Hughes shareholders will own 
between 43% and 46% of the combined company. The combination will 
give Halliburton access to natural gas production and gathering 
systems in North America, South America and Europe. The agreement 
will require approval by the Baker Hughes and Halliburton 
shareholders, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 
2002. The boards of directors of Baker Hughes and Halliburton have 
approved the agreement.

US DOLLAR GAINS FIRM ROUND CUT AS TALKS TO SAVE ECONOMIC CRISIS

The U.S. dollar traded weaker against the yen and the euro 
as investors debated whether the worst U.S. economic crisis in a 
half-century would be averted as talks continued among central 
bankers in Japan and Europe, and Wall Street and financial markets 
voted on the government's ability to contain financial panic.
