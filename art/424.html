make the experience better:

1) We're now showing live prices for all the inventory that is currently being
  sold in your region. This includes any sales in progress. 

2) There's a new tab that tracks the total price for every parcel in your
  region -- from the original listing price to its most recent sale price. 

3) The data in the new Price History tab is refreshed hourly. 

We hope you enjoy this new feature. Please reply back and let us know if 
you have any questions.

Regards,

Pete
