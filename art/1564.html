Guitarist Chuck Barksdale from Toad The Wet Sprocket also makes an appearance on drums.

The cast of the film is as follows (in alphabetical order):

Lizzy Borden (actress): Played by Eliza Dushku

Christine "DooDah" Bellavance (actress): Played by Jessica Simpson

Roxie "Roxie" Bellavance (actress): Played by Heather Locklear

Sheriff Edna Biggs (actress): Played by Jane Kaczmarek

Bill Biggs (actress): Played by Joanna Going

Dale (dog): Played by Gary McDonald

Deputy Sheriff Fuchs (actor): John Cleese (actor) (voice)

Johnny "J.W." Fuchs (actor): Sean Astin (actor) (voice)

Dale (actor): Kevin Pollak (actor) (voice)

Deputy Mayor Pike (actor): John Ritter (actor) (voice)

Pete Pike (actor): Jack Carter (actor) (voice)

Deputy Krankey: David Lander (actor) (voice)

Deputy Bumpowski: Gary Busey (actor) (voice)

The only musical instruments shown in the film are an acoustic guitar and a drum set that is used to play the song "The End Of The World". The guitar player in the film (played by Dushku) is never actually seen performing, and the drummer is also never seen, other than his head and one arm as seen while holding a drumstick.

The songs played in the film include "The End Of The World", "Heaven", "Barefoot Baby", "The Old Man And The Sea", and "I'll Remember You".

This is probably the only movie where a dog is beaten to death with a cat-o'-nine-tails.

The movie has the first use of the "Roxie" character in association with her last name in a movie.

The Sheriff's first name, Edna, is also the name of the villain of the Disney/Famous Players-Lasky movie Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman (1916) which was produced by Jesse Lasky. This will make a nice bookend to the previous film adaptation. Edna can also be found in the films The Wizard of Oz (1939), Auntie Mame (1958), and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982), and in the episodes "The Twilight Zone" and "Little House on the Prairie".

The film poster for "Road to Nowhere" is a parody of The Wizard of Oz, The Getaway, The Thing (1982) and The Breakfast Club.

The songs "The End Of The World", "Heaven", "Barefoot Baby", "The Old Man And The Sea", and "I'll Remember You" have since been played or referenced in several other films and episodes: The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2003), Shallow Hal (2001), American Dad! (2010), and The X-Files (1993).

The film ends with the two leads singing "Love Ain't Nothing but a Four Letter Word", from Neil Young's Harvest.

The film's end credits include several cameos (the only cameo with an actual name): Garth Brooks, Joe Walsh (both in person), Steve Martin, Gwen Stefani, Marybeth Mahoney, Keb' Mo', and The Kinks.

The film ends with the last known footage of John Ritter (on location in Hawaii at the time of his death), before his death on September 3, 1997, who says "Be Careful!" and then a pause, and then an unknown third party chimes in saying "Be Careful!" (this can be seen online in the DVD special features). This was filmed days before his death and is not featured in the special features of the DVD.

The film's premiere was attended by Tom Cruise.

While it is claimed that this is the first film to have been released in widescreen by an independent studio, that claim is not true. "I Wanna Hold Your Hand", directed by John Landis, had an original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 in 1977. It also starred Paul Reubens, Marky Mark, and Sean Astin. It was released by Dimension Pictures, which was then owned by RHI Entertainment, which was later re-named as DreamWorks Pictures. DreamWorks later merged with SKG. Dimension Pictures was founded in 1979 by two former RHI executives.

The film's first five reels are set in a rural environment. This footage was originally shot with anamorphic lenses. Later the studio edited this footage into the picture to make it appear that the film takes place in small town America.

The film's title card makes the following statement: "In an uncertain world, what matters is what you believe to be true. I know everything". Ironically, the film features multiple instances of unreliable narrators, such as Edna (the main female protagonist), Deputy Fuchs, who may or may not be trustworthy, and possibly Bill, who is mentally challenged and/or possibly just hallucinating in one instance.

The film's title card makes the following statement: "I'm sure I've been around a thousand times before. Just been to places where they shot other movies." The same is true for the film's sequel, "Road to Nowhere II: Three Years Later". The film's sequel, "Road to Nowhere II: Three Years Later" is not technically a sequel.

B.G. Knuth, R.H. Houle, R.A. Cuddy, M.C. Houser, and S.L. Kornblum all did stunt work on the film. Houle would become a cast member on "The Sopranos", Kornblum would become a cast member on "Criminal Minds", and Cuddy would also appear on "Criminal Minds".

Despite the fact that the film had a release date of March 17, 1997, Universal refused to send back the studio's print. The video store's copy of the film was released just one day after RHI's studio's copy, and was an unrated version.

The film's closing credits say: "This motion picture was conceived and developed by RHI Entertainment, and is an original work, copyright 1994 RHI Entertainment". This means that the DVD of the film is missing at least two scenes from the original release, or possibly a scene before or after one of those missing scenes. The scene right before "Heaven" was removed in its entirety, and the scene right after "Heaven" was removed in its entirety, with an unknown segment put in.

The movie is a parody of two western films: The Magnificent Seven (1960), which starred John Wayne, and The Hired Hand (1971). In addition to a number of plot similarities, the film features a brief scene near the end of the film in which Edna sings an uncredited version of the Magnificent Seven theme.

The DVD version of "Road to Nowhere" contains alternate footage not found on the "Road to Nowhere" disc, which is titled "Alternate Version of Road to Nowhere" (which can be found as "Alternate Version of Road to Nowhere" in Japanese print and other countries) that includes several notable changes. As well as being slightly less violent and more comedic, the alternative ending has a much different music score, and Ritter has a much more serious ending where he talks to a small group of people about how he was in the Navy, and that's why he is so patriotic to the point of being called in "the war room" and then talking about God.

The film's final lines are slightly different than the one found on the DVD. The line is "Sometimes it is better to run away and try something new, like Edna Bellavance."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:09
