I love you, I love you more
Love you all of my life
Won't be long, I'm gone
I love you, I love you more
Love you all of my life

See if I die tomorrow
You'll be lonely to the end
But there's no more time for cryin'
So don't shed no tears for me
See if I die tomorrow
You'll be lonely to the end
'Cause the nightmares won't let me sleep
That's right, they don't let me sleep

I'll send a postcard someday
Don't forget, to pray for me
I'll send a postcard someday
Don't forget, to pray for me
I'll send a postcard someday
Don't forget, to pray for me
I'll send a postcard someday
Don't forget, to pray for me

So now you know who's sittin' in jail
And I know you understand
There's something more in a single song
Than from you could ever take
