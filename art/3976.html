(SUNDAY, SEPT. 24, 2009) - On the second anniversary of the creation of Stitch in Time, a unique charity organization that provides handmade handbags to terminally ill patients at the Hospice of the South Shore in Quincy, one of its founder's eyes welled up with tears as she remembered some of the people who helped the program grow.

It's her husband, Ken, the one with the eye-catching scar on his forehead. "The way he works is so hands-on," she said, holding up the one-of-a-kind handbag he has made himself. "To be in this program has given him a purpose in life, a reason to live."

But Stitch in Time isn't all about helping people find ways to cope with their illnesses.

There is also another component. In addition to providing much-needed items for the dying, the charity is helping kids.

For example, the idea for a Christmas tree came from one child, a fourth-grader who wanted to build a Christmas tree in a box with some friends of her mother. The family asked the Hospice staff if they could go with them, and before they knew it, hundreds of holiday cards filled the boxes, all ready for their annual trip to the children's hospital.

"There is an energy and excitement that comes from this program, too," said Debby Hatch of Hospice of the South Shore. "There is a spirit of giving. This was started in love, in part because we felt a responsibility to the children."

It began with Lori Fawcett, who, as a hospice volunteer, gave the boxes to a child with cancer in 2000. The child was able to receive the cards with her parents and doctors and nurses by her bedside.

The idea was adopted by others, including Karen DeKoning, a member of the staff who volunteers to make handbags for the children in the program.

They started off as three handbags a year, then four, then five. Now they make them in a box with 10 to 14 bags each year.

One of the boxes is named after Ken, who makes them all by hand, with his eye-patch marking the only blemish.

Now, he has put several on auction on eBay, with all proceeds going to the Hospice program.

"These are little handmade treasures," Debby Hatch said. "To the kids, they can't wait to see them when they arrive."
