NO. 2004-403895; HON. CECIL PURYEAR, PRESIDING
_______________________________

Before QUINN, C.J., and CAMPBELL and HANCOCK, JJ.
ON MOTION TO WITHDRAW AS COUNSEL
	Pending before the court is the motion of attorney David Martinez to withdraw as
counsel for appellant Alex Reyes Perez.  Without passing on the merits of the case,
Martinez's motion is granted.  
	Also pending before the court is a motion to withdraw as appellate counsel for
appellant by attorney Michael C. Shulman, who represents that the appeal is subject to
dismissal pursuant to a plea bargain.  Shulman's motion is also granted.
	It is, therefore, ordered that the appeals be dismissed.  Having dismissed the
appeals at the personal request of both counsel, we will not entertain any motion for
rehearing.

1. And as it turns out, not for the first time.  In 1997, Perez pled guilty to
unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and the court placed him on probation.  In 1998, the
State moved to revoke probation.  In a hearing to revoke Perez's probation, Perez testified
that he had pled guilty to the offense but claimed that he was not the person who was
convicted of that offense. The trial court granted the State's motion and revoked Perez's
probation.

BRYAN K. HOLLINGSWORTH, APPELLANT

V.

THE STATE OF TEXAS, APPELLEE
_________________________________

FROM THE 64TH DISTRICT COURT OF SWISHER COUNTY;

NO. A3577-0402; HONORABLE ROBERT W. KINKAID, JR., JUDGE
_______________________________


Before QUINN, C.J., and REAVIS and CAMPBELL, JJ.
MEMORANDUM OPINION

	Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant Bryan K. Hollingsworth pleaded guilty to
unlawful possession of a firearm. The trial court found the evidence sufficient to find him
guilty, but deferred finding him guilty and placing him on community supervision for five
years. The State filed a motion to revoke, alleging he violated the terms of his
community supervision by driving while intoxicated and failing to avoid injurious and
vicious habits. The court held a hearing on the motion, granted it, revoked appellant's
community supervision, and sentenced him to three years confinement. In presenting this
appeal, counsel has filed an Anders (1) brief in support of a motion to withdraw. We grant
counsel's motion and affirm. 
In support of his motion to withdraw, counsel certifies he has diligently reviewed the
record, and in his opinion, the record reflects no reversible error upon which an appeal can
be predicated. Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967);
Monroe v. State, 671 S.W.2d 583, 585 (Tex.App.--San Antonio 1984, no pet.). Thus, he
concludes the appeal is frivolous. In compliance with High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 813
(Tex.Cr.App. 1978), counsel has candidly discussed why, under the controlling authorities,
there is no error in the trial court's judgment. Counsel has also shown that he sent a copy
of the brief to appellant and informed appellant that, in counsel's view, the appeal is without
merit. In addition, counsel has demonstrated that he notified appellant of his right to review
the record and file a pro se response if he desired to do so. Appellant did not file a
response. Neither did the State favor us with a brief.
By his Anders brief, counsel raises two arguable issues: (1) whether the trial court's
finding appellant violated the conditions of his community supervision is supported by
legally sufficient evidence, and (2) whether appellant was denied effective assistance of
counsel. However, counsel does not cite authority in support of either argument. (2)
	As counsel concedes, the record supports the trial court's finding that appellant
violated the conditions of his community supervision.  However, when a defendant enters
a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, in reliance on a plea bargain agreement, and the trial
court subsequently overrules the State's motion to revoke the probation, the defendant's
conviction must be reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court.  See Puckett v.
United States, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266, 273 (2009). To preserve the issue
for appeal, the complaint on appeal must correspond with the objection made at trial. See
Wilson v. State, 71 S.W.3d 346, 349 (Tex.Cr.App. 2002).
	We have independently examined the entire record to determine whether there are
any non-frivolous issues that were preserved in the trial court. See Penson v. Ohio, 488
U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988); In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403,
409 (Tex.Cr.App. 2008). We have found no such issues. After reviewing the record,
counsel's brief and appellant's pro se response, we agree with counsel that the appeal is
wholly frivolous. See Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824 (Tex.Cr.App. 2005).
Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

1. Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).
2. We note the motion does not support the contention that any error was preserved for
our review. Although there was a plea hearing, the trial court did not announce its
determination to proceed to a hearing on the merits until after appellant entered his plea
of guilty. And, prior to the revocation hearing, appellant did not file any documents or
otherwise seek any additional findings from the trial court and failed to object to the
reporter's record. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. 

3. 1) Whether the trial court's finding appellant violated the conditions of his community
supervision is supported by legally sufficient evidence. 2) Whether appellant was denied
effective assistance of counsel.
