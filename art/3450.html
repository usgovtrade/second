This is not the first time a video game has been discovered.

In 2014, an Atari 2600 was found by a man in a barn in southern California.

The original packaging came with a pamphlet, which included a list of instructions.

“To begin the game insert coin and press A START, To continue press A, Press Y to switch to B, Press A to continue. The screen should now read: ‘PLAY A’. The game has been paused by pressing START,” it said.

“A) Game instructions will begin. The player must answer correctly or the game is over.”

The instructions said you will play a game called “PONG” – “Play the video tape”.

“There are three game modes: ‘Play’ mode, ‘Test’ mode and ‘Options’ mode. ‘Test’ mode is for testing and adjusting the tape. ‘Options’ mode gives the player choices of which tape to play and other features.”

Then there is a list of the company which produced the games in 1980:

“Atari Home Video Games were manufactured by ‘Tubular Video Inc’ under license from ‘Atari, Inc.'”

“Atari, Inc.’ was founded in 1972. It manufactured arcade and home video games and is currently known as ‘Atari, Inc.’ after its acquisition by Hasbro.”

In recent years the most sought after are Atari 2600 videogames – but their scarcity hasn’t prevented them from being sold for high prices.

For instance, a 1983 game was sold for $42,000 (£33,000) in 2015 and a 1979 game sold for $35,000 (£27,000) last year.

And this game – this is the Holy Grail, the holy grail of videogames – hasn’t been played before and could be worth thousands of pounds.

One of the last games ever made by Atari – the last is said to have been in the 1980s.

Incredibly, the games were made by hand, which is not the easiest thing to do.

“They must be treated with extreme care and extreme respect. When being moved from the packaging into the new owner’s home, a wooden crate with an extra-thick box top will be placed around the games for protection,” the instructions said.

“When you play a game and win, never take any part of the game apart for any reason.”

After you have finished playing the instructions said to “place the game back in the wooden crate and return it to the wooden crate, put the lid on and make it your new pet.

“Remember, ‘PONG’ is a living, breathing creature, which needs exercise and care to survive.

“It is also illegal to sell or give away any part of this special creature, in case it is mistreated.

“The games must never be sold or given away.”

It added: “If you give away a game, it dies. If you buy a game for a friend, the game will go to the bottom of a garbage disposal, or to a landfill.

“If the game dies in any way or is mutilated, do not buy another game.

“Do not give away the game without telling the person you give it to what the game is, and the risks involved in keeping the game.”

The game may have been a hoax – it is impossible to say if there is a chance this is genuine – but the instructions are genuine.

They would have come with the game, printed on card to fit in the wooden crate.

The packaging had the name of a company called ‘Tubular Video’ on the side – but the game is not listed in any public records.

The packaging has not been listed for sale before – although these games do sometimes surface.

Last year, a man in Connecticut sold a game of Pac Man for $10,000 (£8,000).

And five years ago, a game called E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, was auctioned for $35,000 (£27,000).

Another Atari 2600 game sold for $10,500 (£8,300) in 2013 and another went for $7,500 (£5,900) in 2010.

A collection of Atari 2600 videogames was sold for $4,200 (£3,300) in 2011.

More than 50 years after the release of Pac Man – in the early 1980s – it was revealed there are still undiscovered games in a warehouse at Atari.

They have been stashed away for decades.

The games, which could still be playable, were discovered after a fire caused by a faulty heater burned the warehouse to the ground.

The games were kept in the warehouse for decades – and were never sold.

The Atari 2600 was the first video game system that could offer high-resolution graphics in a home setting.

The games were created by the Fairchild Video Entertainment Company – and the video game that has become most associated with the Atari 2600 is called Pac Man.

The game was released in 1977 – and is credited with being one of the most successful arcade games of all time.

In 1984, the Atari Video Computer System – the successor to the Atari 2600 – became the first console to be released with a colour monitor and a sound card.

On 7 November 2018, a man from Colorado, US, discovered a prototype Atari 2600 game in an attic in Colorado, US.

And in 2015 a man found two games from 1978.

The game was advertised on TV and described as ‘the world’s newest electronic games’.

The games – the man bought the box for around $100 (around £77) and said it had a fair few features including lights and sounds.

The man then discovered the game is worth thousands of pounds.

It has the letter ‘P’ written on the front and ‘Play It’ on the back.
