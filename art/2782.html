Introduction

Physical activity in adults has been recognized as an integral factor in the overall health of the nation [1]. In addition, as evidenced by the National Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans [2], there is a growing interest in promoting the health and well-being of adults through increasing physical activity levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other governmental organizations such as the National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association have taken on the challenge to develop evidence-based, evidence-based intervention strategies for individuals and populations that can help the public attain health benefits.

This research initiative was developed to improve understanding of how lifestyle factors (exercise, fitness, and nutrition) promote public health. This chapter includes a focus on research studies conducted by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), especially those studies that are interdisciplinary in nature. These studies were designed to evaluate the relationship of the aforementioned lifestyle factors to overall health, such as cardiovascular fitness, cardiovascular disease, cancer, longevity, and others. This work was funded by various federal agencies, foundations, and other groups such as the American Heart Association. It was published in scientific journals, presented at conferences, and discussed with organizations and individuals in the areas of community health and health promotion.

This chapter reviews evidence-based research involving physical activity, exercise, fitness, and nutrition for the improvement of health-related outcomes. It begins with a historical overview of studies and interventions that have led to an understanding of the impact of physical activity, exercise, and fitness on the health of individuals. From this beginning, it highlights studies that have been funded by the National Institutes of Health, with</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:39
