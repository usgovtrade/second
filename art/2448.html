<sophie_> hi
<Pici> hi
<sophie_> I did "svn update" in terminal, that worked. Then I tried to add the url "svn+ssh://user@domain.tld" to source.list. Then I got "error: cannot open display:".
<sophie_> How come?
<Pici> sophie_: Probably because you're running it in a terminal window rather than through gnome, kde, or xfce?
<sophie_> I'm using terminal. In ubuntu only in terminal you can do "svn update" without root rights
<sophie_> And by default it was downloading from ubuntu "main servers". I changed it and now I get the message that there's no such directory.
<Pici> sophie_: I'm not sure then, it sounds to me like you need to have xauth installed.
<sophie_> I already tried to install it, then I got another error, so I'm a bit confused...
<sophie_> I still don't understand why I can't update to the newest version in synaptic. Is it because that repository does not provide it?
<sophie_> My first question: how can I make it able to download from any server? What should I change in file /etc/apt/sources.list and/or sources.list.d ?
<sophie_> I already edited the file manually, what else should I do ?

<n2diy> when attempting to play a DVD with mplayer or totem, both fail with: "libdvdread: Encrypted DVD support unavailable.
<n2diy>        No stream found to handle url dvd://1
<n2diy> the movie is from my camera, as I transfered it to my HDD.
<Pici> n2diy: do you have the libdvdread3 package installed?
<n2diy> Pici, umm, didn't think about that, would Totem be running it under dafaults, and/or, how do I check?
<n2diy> default
<Pici> n2diy: default for totem is totem-gstreamer which is part of the ubuntu-desktop metapackage, so make sure that is installed.  For mplayer, I don't know, sorry.
<n2diy> Pici, ok, let me check that out, thanks.
<Pici> n2diy: also, if you're using totem-gstreamer you can install a codec for libdvdcss2, from Medibuntu, with the medibuntu repo
<Pici> !medibuntu
<ubottu> medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - See http://www.medibuntu.org
<n2diy> Pici, ok, thanks, let me check that out as well, I know I can't be the only one with this problem.
<Pici> n2diy: also, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html
<n2diy> Pici, thanks again.
<Sebastian> hi, I just bought a new laptop, and wish to have it set up as a small server, which distro would you guys recommend?
<Sebastian> for its primary purpose
<sophie_> Pici, how can I make "apt-get" change the source to download from a server which I specify? I'm willing to change every single "default" in ubuntu :\
<Pici> sophie_: Thats not really something we can help you with, you'd have to look into synaptic's preferences for a setting that says what to use by default.
<Sebastian> the only reason I am not just sticking with ubuntu is the fact that the new kernel has problems with the ati radeon xpress 200m chipset
<sophie_> Pici, I already changed it in synaptic, "download from network", I also wrote how can I make "apt-get" change the source to download from a server which I specify
<x1250> anyone having a problem running gnomesu?
<x1250> $ gnomesu
<x1250> /usr/lib/libgcj.so: error while loading shared libraries: libawt_xawt.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
<FloodBotK2> x1250: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
<Pici> x1250: Please use #kubuntu for KDE support
<Sebastian> x1250: maybe you should use some gnome-based distro?
<x1250> Sebastian, I need ubuntu because I need the gnome stuff, but I don't want any gnome-libs installed, since my ubuntu is very light
<Sebastian> lol, not as heavy as ubuntu
<x1250> Sebastian, I don't want evolution installed, neither gnome office, so I'm a Gnome user and a Ubuntu user, and that can't be done. At least in debian you can install a ubuntu base system without anything related to gnome and use apt-pinning for every other package (with gnome or not)
<Sebastian> x1250: what do you want to do?
<x1250> Sebastian, I want to avoid gnome libraries from the default repositories
<x1250> with debian I can install ubuntu base, then remove packages from the ubuntu-desktop and install stuff from the debian-desktop
<x1250> Sebastian, in ubuntu can't do that
<x1250> can I?
<Sebastian> x1250: sorry man, don't know the answer to that
<x1250> np, thanks anyway
<Sebastian> :P
<x1250> Sebastian, and you? What do you use ubuntu for?
<Sebastian> x1250: i use ubuntu for everything but gaming
<Sebastian> x1250: as in, I can't play any games on it, atm
<Sebastian> x1250: but i could be wrong
<Sebastian> x1250: since that's not the purpose I use it
<Sebastian> x1250: i also have it installed for use of the openbox WM, that's my second desktop
<Sebastian> x1250: but I would use KDE instead of that
<x1250> Sebastian, for games, try a distro like debian, you don't even have to apt-get install any package, it's all there
<x1250> Sebastian, I'm still trying to decide if I should use fluxbuntu, or xubuntu, or ubuntu + lxde or something like that
<x1250> but it seems its still not ready for me, too much work.
<x1250> maybe I'll go back to debian after all, it has enough software for me
<Sebastian> x1250: debian comes with too much stuff that I don't need :P
<x1250> Sebastian, exactly, so there's no space for new stuff I want
<x1250> I have to do the work. But thanks anyway :)
<Sebastian> x1250: lol
<Sebastian> x1250: you don't need to worry if you don't want it
<Sebastian> x1250: i was just trying to help :)
<Sebastian> x1250: it's easier to get stuff from repositories than compile from source
<Sebastian> x1250: but then again, you can compile too many things
<x1250> Sebastian, I like the simplicity of ubuntu. But not having gnome just doesnt work for me, and some of the things I like about ubuntu wouldn't work otherwise. So I have to do the work to make it look like I want it to look like.
<x1250> Sebastian, if I had a lot of time, I'd just compile, but I have to do other stuff, and ubuntu is just too simple
<Sebastian> x1250: debian might be what you're looking for
<Sebastian> x1250: you said there are two machines, you can try a lightweight distro on one
<Sebastian> x1250: with a lightweight WM, like openbox
<x1250> Sebastian, I'm not going to do a dual-boot again, I've been doing that for so long :p I'd like a simple OS I can access from anywhere and does not need network services.
<Sebastian> x1250: if you install the ubuntu server edition, you can set up the partitions and everything
<Sebastian> x1250: then install gnome or any other</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:32
