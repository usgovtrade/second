It is a lightweight substance, one that can be combined with many other materials to create a "molecular Lego" to form a composite material that is lighter than carbon fiber and stronger than steel.

It's flexibility, toughness and ability to conduct electricity (hence why it will make a great battery for everything from your phone to your electric vehicle) are just a few of the reasons it can be used in a wide variety of products. This graphene-based concrete will also be much stronger, harder and lighter than the original concrete because it's molecules are arranged in a way that lets the fibers bind together.

Now the interesting thing is that graphene is in no way new. Scientists have been working with it for decades and are using it in applications from electronic displays to touch screens, fuel cells to lithium-ion batteries. But graphene's potential use in composite materials like concrete is brand new, and one that holds promise for those that need a material strong enough for building bridges or even skyscrapers. What's more, because it can be mixed in with existing concrete, companies won't have to invest in brand new equipment to produce it.

For graphene's uses in concrete, we should all be thankful to the scientists at University of Bath in the UK who first discovered it.
