you got, I get more, I get more angry, 
I get more sad, I get more depressed, 
I get more anxious. And they’re, 
I’m not talking about the addict, 
the addict feels good because they don’t care 
if they’re a good person. They just want to get it.
And the person, the person 
you said what you said is who 
it’s affecting, because of the lack of care 
in the addict, and that they want to use 
and put others at risk in order 
to get it, but if they didn’t have it, 
they’d feel good about themselves, 
so it’s very addictive, and it does affect, 
it does affect the user, 
the person who’s trying to use
to try and stay away 
from the addiction 
because they don’t like what they’re addicted 
to, but they’re addicted to it. 
But the person they’re using it on,
who they’re using it on, it does 
affect that. And so that’s another thing 
I wanted to talk about that’s important.
This is true, this is true,
we talked about that, that addiction
affects people, the person who is addicted 
to using substances, they have 
a lot of mental health issues, 
they have a lot of issues, 
but they have addictions, 
and these things affect people 
around them as well, and it’s
often people that are close to 
the addict that the people closest 
to the addict. Most of the time the addict 
is in the household. 
And that person who’s the addict 
they’re so used to using that drug that they 
don’t care about others. So they use it 
in their home, and they don’t even know 
that they’re using, they just use it and 
they won’t stop, and they know 
they need it for that, and they don’t care. 
This is true, this is true, because I don’t 
know how many of you watch, 
but I have seen on TV interviews 
with people where I’ve seen interviews 
and they’re, they had to use 
something to numb their pain 
for mental health issues. So 
they’re on pain killers, that aren’t good for you, 
but that’s the only way 
that they can numb themselves, 
so they can function in their day. 
They can function, because they have mental health issues, 
but the pain killers make them 
function, but it’s not a good thing.
And when I say, “How are 
they going to function, 
and how are you going to do 
what you do, if you’re on drugs?”
That’s how they get to do 
what they do. “Oh I get off of the pain killers 
and then I don’t function.” Well you 
functioned with the pain killers. So 
I know some people that are addicted to heroin, 
and they get there first thing in the morning, 
they sit and they shoot it, and they start, 
“I need to get more,” and they’re 
all that they have. “I need to get more. 
I need more,” and they don’t do their home life, 
and their family don’t even know, 
they don’t even notice that they don’t do 
their job, and that the bills aren’t paid. 
They just come home and they’re high, 
they’re stoned, and they’re wasted. 
But they’re using that to numb their mind 
to forget everything, and they do that, 
they have kids, 
they have to take care of, because it’s an 
addiction and they’re not being 
treated for the addiction.
What does this have to do with 
the book about parenting, 
what does this have to do with 
this book? This is 
a major issue. This is a big issue in 
addiction, it has to do with parenting.
One day, after reading, I was just shocked.
I was reading a report on the news, 
I saw a report about foster care. 
Where the foster children had to go 
to multiple foster homes, 
where they had five different homes, 
they had to, and they were trying 
to get into a stable home for the kids, 
it was just shocking to me, and 
then I saw this report, and the 
parenting of these children, 
and the adults who are supposed 
to be taking care of these kids, 
these kids are being put in homes, 
where they have this chemical, this drug 
in their home, 
and they aren’t getting 
help for it. So that’s part of 
addiction, and that’s part of parenting.
Because there’s a lot of adults 
who are being addicted 
to drugs, they’re not having help, 
and they are also taking care of kids 
and they’re not getting help. 
And if you read the book, 
I talk about 
and I tell people, when you are addicted, 
you are willing to put your drug, 
and you are willing to get high, before you get 
professional help to get clean, you are willing 
to put the drug first. 
Not just your life, but you are willing 
to put the drug first. 
I can see that, because I was 
doing that, that’s why 
I needed the book. Because 
I had to get over the addiction first.
I was willing to get high before I got help, 
but now I know, I don’t want to have 
that kind of life anymore. 
I don’t want to have that kind of life. 
And if I can show people that in my story, 
it can save lives.
Parents like that aren’t 
being helped. 
But if they need help, then they can have it.
And if people see that in their life, 
if they see that in their life, 
they can change their ways. 
And we can fix things.
I know people are on the
internet, people are buying
books, but they can’t get past the first few 
chapters, they give up, because 
they can’t even find a way 
to get the book, because they 
get blocked. “I can’t get, 
I can’t get through these.” 
Well I have it on tape, I have
the audio on tape, if you’re 
having problems reading, 
I’m going to put this on podcasts, 
I’m going to put it on YouTube. 
I’m going to put it on the social media 
that I have, that people can go, “Okay, 
this is all the pages, this is all the 
information that we need. 
Just go through this, you have to 
go through this, and you can’t, you just have 
to go through these chapters. It’s 
not that hard.”
This is not hard. I want people 
to see this as not hard, 
because I know that we can fix 
the problems in our lives. 
We can change the things, we can change the things. 
We can fix the issues. I just talked to 
one person today, and she’s worried, 
and I’m just going to show you a few things, 
that you need to read, and you can do it.
You can read the book and fix your life, 
and you can do it.
And you have to do it, because it’s hard.
I can see that, because I was 
trying to do that, 
but I could never do it. I could never get 
to where I needed to be, 
and I know it’s hard, 
it’s hard when I was doing that, 
to get there, 
but if you have the proper help, 
if you have a support group of people that 
are helping you, a program that you need to go 
to, a school that you need to go to, 
you have to change. But when you’re on drugs, 
when you’re using drugs, it will affect 
everything in your life, 
if you’re going to be using drugs, 
and if you’re not going to get help, 
it’s going to affect your life, 
it’s going to take a toll. It’s going</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:41
