Such devices are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,904,829, issued Sept. 9, 1975, entitled, "Camera Tripod". Although such devices have enjoyed substantial commercial success, they have not entirely fulfilled the need for a flexible positioning system. Some devices tend to be limited in their adjustment and also lack an ability to properly position and hold small, lightweight cameras.
Another shortcoming of such devices resides in the nature of their use. Typically, prior art base supports must be either manually adjusted to accommodate particular camera placement or set on a preselected position. While such devices are operable for their intended purpose, it is not uncommon for a user to lose or forget the preset positions. Thus, a user may either have to change cameras or manually hold the camera in the desired position.
Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a support for cameras which has the ability to provide an infinite number of support surfaces.
It is a further object of this invention to provide a camera support which incorporates a novel strap adjuster mechanism.
It is a further object of this invention to provide a camera support which is adaptable for quick release and easy adjustment, while also providing the necessary ruggedness to withstand repeated set-ups.
It is another object of this invention to provide a flexible camera support which includes a novel release mechanism.
It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a camera support which also provides a means for holding the camera in a substantially parallel orientation.
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon familiarization with the specification, drawings and claims contained herein.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:01
