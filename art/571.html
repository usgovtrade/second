Quiggly went up to the monster and said "I'll be a mouse and you be a cat. You chase me so I can have fun running after you." The monster turned to his friend and said "What's this? This thing wants to be chased?" The creature jumped on Quiggly and bit his tail off. Quiggly yelped, and as he tried to run off the monster said "I'm not gonna chase you. You are a little guy, you can't catch me." Then he stepped on Quiggly's tail and he was out of action. Quiggly was trapped for the winter. He never saw anything but the monster for the rest of the winter.

The monster became the new teacher's pet

Then the next day at school, the teachers asked Quiggly why he didn't go to school. Quiggly said that he was sick because of the monster who had eaten him for dinner and a light bulb came on in their heads. The monster is an animal and so he had no rights and he didn't deserve that respect and compassion from the teachers. Quiggly was the real victim and the teachers were the bad guys and that is the way they teach that story. It's wrong to hurt people for fun or out of boredom or for no reason at all. It makes no sense to not feel bad for hurting others when it's fun. Don't do it just because you're bored.

Quit being cruel to your pets

Be kind to your pet because it's in the nature of your pet and it's your pet and it feels pain. In the wilds, it's always better to be a kind person to animals. Don't go chasing after them, they are your friends, but don't leave them unattended. They might not have the same rights as you and if you treat them poorly they can feel sad, and they can have bad attitudes, even towards you. So be nice. You can be angry with your friend, but you don't have to hurt them or be mean to them. It's good that you should go chasing after your friends and do things for them, but not if you go too far and hurt them.

This is Quiggly

What else? What else? Quiggly saw in his pocket that his lucky coin was there from the monster. Quiggly wondered if the monster had any more of his tail and Quiggly started to talk to the monster about what he would have done had he had more tails and the monster said "But I have plenty of tails. I found a place in the hills where there were lots of tails hanging on trees. Then Quiggly told the monster he shouldn't go there because it is a place where people come to catch people and he asked the monster "Should I be a chicken for the rest of my life? I couldn't live that way, my tail is too big." "Yes, probably not. The monster was a man-eating man and just wanted to kill any of the people out in the hills. Then Quiggly said "Let's both go out to this place, the monster was invited, and they would both go and when they were there Quiggly grabbed the monster by the arm and the monster yelled "Let go!" He was shocked that the monster didn't like it and said "I'm gonna make you tell me what you are doing in the woods! This is an animal paradise, I want to know how you come here and you do harm, you have to tell me." The monster started to blab on about how he had gotten bored with the town and that he wanted to go out to the hills and meet his friends, but none of them would come to the hills so he decided to go there himself. The monster said that he would go and meet with his friends to get some exercise, but every day when he was out in the hills he was attacked by humans. "Now I don't know what that is and I'm gonna figure out what it is," said the monster. Quiggly was very upset. The monster was a bad guy and he hurt Quiggly.

The monster made Quiggly go with him

Then the monster threw Quiggly against the trees, and Quiggly started to wonder how this would end and he wanted to know what would become of him, but then Quiggly started to feel sick and he remembered how the monster had eaten him up. He tried to get away from the monster but the monster grabbed him and threw him against a tree. Then the monster took off running into the hills. Quiggly took off running after him, and he started to wonder if the monster was going to eat him now because he had been caught, so he started to think and run. He was hot on the trail and the trail went through the hills and the monster turned around and said "If you are so smart, why don't you come and follow me? I can't be doing this all the time. I am not a monster, I am a monster hunter!" "I know you are the monster hunter, you said so." "That's right, you are the one. I'll be hunting you." Quiggly said "Ok, well then how am I gonna get my coin?" "I guess you will get your coin back if you don't get caught and caught you will be. You look in a cave and you are a good hunter and a good boy and you will get your coin back. It's in a cave, and you can see it but it's guarded by a giant monster, and that monster and you can't get past it so you can't see it. It's just for young adventurers." "What's it worth?" "You have to figure that out." Quiggly tried to get out of going and tried to find a place where he could find a coin that had the same weight, weight as a dragon but when Quiggly was on his back and going that way it felt like his back was getting broken. "You don't get to make up the weight of the dragon in advance," said the monster hunter, "If you are to win your prize you will have to meet the terms of the cave. You can take the dragon coin."

Quiggly went into the cave and on the journey out, he picked up some shiny pebbles which he held in his mouth, but he had to use both hands to hold onto the dragon tail. In the middle of the cave there was a giant fire, it was so big that it was over 200 feet high, and Quiggly didn't know if there was any way to get out of there. Quiggly didn't think that he could get through it and that he was stuck in a cave and he thought about not having a dragon tail and thought about his parents and he thought about his brother and he thought about his school and he tried to think how he would get out of this cave. He wanted to help others. The dragon hunter was looking to make fun of him and kill him. Then Quiggly realized how much he hated the monster hunter. Quiggly decided to change his diet, he would go without any food. Then he started to feel dizzy and then he felt a little sick and then he felt a little better and then he felt great and then he threw up and then he was fine. Then he felt very bad and then he felt good. When he felt bad he felt as if his eyes were popping out and as if he were on fire and when he was in trouble he felt very cold. When he felt cold his teeth were tingling, and when he was in trouble, he was going to die, he was in deep trouble. Then he got dizzy and thought that he might have a heart attack, so he started to worry about dying. Then he felt that his left hand was getting sore and he thought he was going to have a stroke. Then he saw a wall coming towards him that got very close to him and he was wondering how he could save himself. Then he saw a giant monster that was so big that it looked like a giant dinosaur and it was looking right at Quiggly. The giant monster had big teeth and he opened his mouth and he wanted to eat Quiggly and he wanted to eat him now. Then he realized what this monster was doing and he saw a big dragon. It was a dragon that was bigger than the whole school, and it was very hot, and it was huge and it had sharp teeth and razor teeth and it was a real dragon. The dragon wasn't breathing fire, and it was trying to talk, but Quiggly couldn't understand anything it said. Quiggly tried to get past the dragon, but he couldn't and then he fell into the cave and the ground swallowed him up and he wanted to die. Then he realized that the monster was really there. "Oh no," said Quiggly, "I just wanted to be the teacher's pet but I never got to be the monster hunter's pet." "It's a good thing that I saved you because this is a special pet." The monster did more magic and Quiggly was scared. Then Quiggly said "But I didn't save you, I'm sorry, I didn't do it. I don't care, I don't want to live with you." "Oh, don't say that, you are a good boy and you are gonna be the best monster hunter ever." "But I don't want to be the best monster hunter ever. Don't make me. I have to see my parents."
