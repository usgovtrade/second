Instead 
of being a beacon for hope 
and a shining light for the people 
of India, the Prime Minister 
has instead become a beacon for 
dishonesty and an object 
of contempt.
His party's campaign is rooted 
in falsehood. 
Fake news. Rumors. 
Lies. 
And all of it designed to sow 
the seeds of hatred and division. 
That is what he does. 
That is what he offers. 
And in doing so he sows the seeds 
of his own downfall. 
And so I say tonight, 
India's destiny lies in her own
hands. 
The choice is hers.
So my message to the people of 
India is this: The future 
lies in how we respond to this 
moment of trial. 
We must have the courage and 
selflessness 
to put our unity ahead of our 
differences, to have the unity 
of purpose 
to rise above our deepest 
divisions. 
And we must have the strength 
of conviction to see our people 
through this. 
Because this is the choice before
us.
We must decide whether we are 
bound by hatred or whether we 
will rise above our differences. 
Decide, for we have an election 
coming up and this moment will 
give way to the future. 
And so much rides on that choice.
There is much at stake in our 
future, 
not just for the people of 
India, 
but for all of us around the 
world.
Whether we like it or not, this 
time, India matters. 
No matter where we come from, 
what we look like, 
what religion we adhere to or 
whether we were born here or 
whether we come from across 
the seas, we are all members of 
this great Indian family. 
We are all one. 
And whether we are Hindu or 
Muslim, Sikh or Christian, 
we must now stand together 
against the forces that threaten 
to divide us.
The divisions and distinctions 
we make in the name of religion 
or sect,
nation or class distract us 
from what is common in each one 
of us.
We tear at the social fabric that
unites us 
in our shared humanity. 
We see this when mosques are 
ruthlessly attacked, 
when temples are desecrated, when
Muslims and Dalits are assaulted 
and killed for loving their God, 
for following the same 
religion. 
And when any one of us tries to 
bring our brothers and sisters 
together. 
India is diverse. 
And these distinctions are bred 
into our very fiber, 
by the same impulse that makes us
who we are, 
what makes us strong. 
They are the lifeblood of our 
civilizations.
Yet, the Prime Minister seems to
live in a kind 
of alternate reality where there 
is a Hindu India, 
where Hindus have the country 
and everyone else is 
on the outside. 
Here's what he said in June. 
I consider myself as a very 
Hindu nationalist. 
I believe in Hindu religion, 
culture, 
tradition, Hindusim, nationalism.
Religion, to me, spiritualism, 
it is most important. 
Hindutva, nationalism 
is very important. 
Some Indian politicians, 
even those who call themselves 
Hindus, 
would even deny that India was 
born of Hindu culture. 
This is a Hindu government. 
They are using my language. 
They are speaking my language. 
Not those who are not Hindus, 
that it is not their language. 
Those who speak in different 
language. 
Not in my language. 
Because they are those 
who have taken away my country. 
The Prime Minister has even 
suggested that Muslims in India 
would have no right to 
self-determination.
This cannot be our future. 
India is no stranger to crisis. 
But our strength lies in 
our unity. 
Our success depends on the 
success of each one of us, 
on the success of our families, 
the success of our communities, 
the success of our societies.
It is time to come together, 
forge new alliances, 
forge new friendships, and above
all else, 
let us forge a new purpose, 
for the world needs India. 
And India needs us. 
When we look together, we see 
what we share, the best of us.
What we hold in common, 
the most sacred values and a 
commitment to universal truths 
and universal love. 
It was the best of us, our vision
of India,
that was on display in the days 
after independence, 
a celebration of diversity. 
A recognition that the best of 
India is not found 
in any single nation or religion,
but in the belief in each 
of us. 
On that foundation, we 
build a nation that is prosperous
and inclusive. 
But instead, the Prime Minister 
has been consumed with his 
own 
vision, one that seeks to destroy
not just India but India's soul.
Those who follow him have no 
vision for our future. 
They have only hatred in their 
hearts. 
They have only fear in their 
minds. 
And so our nation calls out to 
all the friends of India, 
who have faith in India's future.
For we can only be strong if we 
are united. 
We can only be a nation that 
loves if we respect and honor 
each other. 
The forces that seek to destroy 
India 
have found a voice in this 
country, a voice that seeks to 
undermine India's tradition of 
inclusiveness. 
A voice that seeks to divide the
nation, 
and the people of India, 
ethnic, religious, political, 
and economic groups are pitted 
against each other. 
We cannot allow these dark forces
to win. 
The future of the nation is now 
being weighed in these moments 
of trial.
It is a choice that is in the 
hands of each one of us.
Not just the Prime Minister, 
but all of us, 
each one of us. 
Each of us must decide where 
we stand and who we will stand 
with. 
We must choose who we will stand
for. 
For the forces of fear, 
hatred, and division will only 
grow stronger if we do not rise 
up against them. 
We must protect our democracy, 
one of the great strengths of 
our nation. 
We cannot allow this moment to 
pass. 
We cannot let down our guard. 
The foundations of this nation 
are strong. 
We stand with the ordinary men 
and women of this land. 
We will protect our future. 
And for us, for the people of 
India, 
freedom, justice, and equality 
will prevail.
And for me, and for every Indian,
it is not just a matter of 
principle. 
Each one of us has a part in 
shaping 
this future. 
We can all shape the future of 
our country. 
We can each do the right thing. 
Now is the time to stand together
for justice and democracy. 
Each of us is now an instrument 
of change. 
We must rise above our fears. 
We must prove to the world that 
we are a nation made strong by 
love, not by hatred. 
And together, we must stand up 
and defend this nation, 
for we have been entrusted with 
the responsibility of leading the
world into a better future. 
May we be blessed with wisdom 
and may the light of 
goodness and truth guide us. 
This is our moment. 
This is our opportunity. 
We must make our choice. 
Jai Hind.
Jai Hind.
