The kid made not a move and then he said with a sly grin:

I heard you and you’re dead! The boy smiled as he said:

Don’t be so sure, Quiggly said as he grabbed ahold of him and whispered:

How old are you? He asked with an equally curious tone, but for some reason that he can’t quite figure out, it felt as if something wasn’t quite right…

Tee, tee, tee, tee…Tee, tee, tee, tee…

Quiggly grabbed him by his tiny, little shoulder and the boy said:

I’m seven and a half. As his hands dropped away from the boy, Quiggly got into an immediate battle stance, just as he did back when he was ten-years-old and he was fighting with Fudge Lump…But as he held up his right hand and extended his left to catch the boy’s chin, he realized that what he was seeing wasn’t the boy that he fought at that age but the boy as he was now…He didn’t look any different to him at all, he looked the same as he did when he was eleven, so he asked:

What are you? He asked the boy with a tinge of anger and anger that had been bottled up for years as the boy began to giggle:

What am I? The boy’s eyes lit up as he said:

A wizard! As he finished, Quiggly felt a chill run up and down his spine, and he felt as if he was back at that very moment when he tried to impress the gang with the magic trick that he did as a child…Although, he knew that they had never let him be that wizened wizard as they had him be the first one to be turned into a potato that was thrown at the poor little kid, but that was an entirely different story for a different time…

But now, he was just as confused as he was back then when the kids asked him what he was and laughed at him when he did this magical show for them…There was something haunting about this boy though, and Quiggly could tell that there was more to this than he knew…

The boy giggled as he repeated:

A wizard! Yes, it all felt so surreal, but Quiggly kept on staring at him as he asked him:

What am I, son? His eyes shifted from confusion to frustration as he said:

I don’t know what you are! He said as he began to giggle even harder:

Mysterious! He said as he laughed even more! Quiggly just stood there and thought to himself:

What is this?! He thought and reached out to hug him, but then he stopped short and his stomach dropped to his feet as he said:

Hold on a second…His mind was screaming: You know! You know what he is, but you just can’t remember…You see, Quiggly didn’t remember what the boy looked like back then, so it was only natural to think that the boy was lying to him, but his memories were cloudy, clouded, cloudy…But he could remember that he was a wizard, so what was he doing now? What was that little kid doing now? So with that, Quiggly just stood there and thought:

It’s him! That wasn’t any boy that he saw years and years ago! That wasn’t any boy, it was the little kid that he couldn’t remember anymore! He gasped and gasped as he said:

You’re the boy, you’re the one! He said as he held onto him and the boy blurted out:

Yes! Yes, he is! We have to help him get out of this! He said and then he began to shout:

You’re just a boy! You’re a boy, we have to save you! The boy got excited as he said:

I don’t care! You have to help me out of here! Quiggly said as he grabbed him with all of his might and said:

Who the heck are you? He said as he pulled him through the forest…I’m Quiggly Quill, he said as he looked into his eyes to see the blue of the twinkling stars as they got closer and closer to his little hut…His brain was telling him to remember something, but he didn’t know what it was, and just as he prepared to ask him: Who are you? The little boy whispered in his ear:

D-Do you believe in ghosts? Quiggly blinked his eyes rapidly and asked the boy: What do you mean? He said:

The boy began to squint his eyes and then he said:

My dad and I saw a ghost! He said as he squinted his eyes and put his index finger to his chin as if he were doing some kind of inner struggle…He turned to Quiggly and said:

It was this weekend, Dad and me went fishing and my boat got hit by lightning, it got completely smashed and the whole thing sunk, so I came home with dad and he went out to get the boat while I was in the house and a little while after he got back, he sent me to go get some firewood, and then he got all pale and passed out. When I went to check on him, he was unconscious, and he started convulsing, and his face was all distorted and his eyes went all white as he passed out and I panicked! I ran out of the house and got on the other side of the forest to get to the other hut that I lived in, but when I got there, it was completely burned and I came here when I couldn’t find my other home…Oh my god…His voice was trembling and he said:

If you don’t believe me, just keep looking for them…Quiggly tried to calm him down as he said:

Okay…But he will show you what he is! I was a little more than annoyed, so I stopped him as I said:

You have to believe me! I don’t know what you are, but you are not a ghost, okay? Quiggly said as he reached out for the boy with the little hand that he had and the boy looked deep into his eyes and said:

Okay, okay! He said and then he continued:

I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…He said as he stopped and said:

I’m so sorry, he said as he wrapped his arms around him and buried his face in his sweater. Quiggly felt as if something was trying to claw its way out of him, but he never would let it. Then he wrapped his arms around the boy, and he tried to reassure him that everything was going to be okay, but when he tried to kiss the boy on the cheek, he just stopped in his tracks and said:

You’re not the only one with a problem…What is this place? I said to him as he glanced around the dimly-lit forest:

The trees are just as big as they’ve always been, as if nothing had ever changed, and that was strange to him, because there were so many things that he couldn’t remember back then. So when he heard the voice behind him say:

Did I scare you? The boy got off of him and said:

N-No…I’m just not sure what I’m supposed to do here, he said as he began to reach up into his short hair and said:

And from then on, the boy’s appearance began to change, and as Quiggly watched him, he began to become a young man of his memories, and when he saw him transform into the young man that he was, he suddenly got an odd feeling in his stomach as if something in his body had changed for good and then he noticed it as he asked him:

What’s with the hands? The boy’s eyes got wide and his eyes got all glassy as he said:

I have six fingers, I’m part wizard…But I forgot them all…

Quiggly just stared at him for a moment, but he wanted so badly to ask him about it but was afraid to break the spell as he asked:

Then you shouldn’t have any trouble catching the fireflies with your hands, Quiggly said as the kid grabbed his arm and brought it to his eye as he said:

My hands are red now because they’re covered in firefly slime, and that’s why I can’t move them…

He paused as he watched him and then said:

Okay, I’m not sure what to do, I guess I should take you somewhere else, he said as he tried to take the boy’s hand and bring him over to his house as he said:

But before he could do that, he was suddenly grabbed by what felt like a pair of gigantic invisible hands, he was then lifted up and had his eyes locked onto the darkness as he shouted:

I…

I’m free, I’m free, Quiggly said</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:26
