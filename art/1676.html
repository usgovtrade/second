History 
Witherfall started in 2002 with the release of three independently produced demo songs "Crying for the Rain", "The Weight of the World" and "I Am Broken" and a self-titled EP in 2003. During this period members of the band participated in The Unholy Crusade's tribute record to German metal band Rage.

At the end of 2004, Witherfall joined Tooth & Nail Records and recorded their debut album, Witherfall, released June 1, 2005, which included "Broken" which won first place in their debut Rock the Vote contest.

They released their second album, Silence in the Snow in February 2007, which included a new version of "Broken", and had it featured as a download on Gotee Records' Christian Music Store. A couple of months later the band joined the first annual Warped Tour, playing the main stage alongside bands such as Hinder, Taking Back Sunday, Cartel, Emery, The Rocket Summer, Fireflight, Audio Adrenaline, Breathe Carolina, Sick Puppies, Anberlin and Emarosa.

By August 2007, Witherfall had played on the main stage at Cornerstone as well as in opening slots for Hinder and Cartel. They participated in a summer Christian music tour called Rock This City with Emery, Thousand Foot Krutch, MxPx, Nonpoint, and A Day To Remember. On October 19, 2008 the band released their third full-length album entitled This Is What Hope Looks Like. The album was officially released by Standstill Records. Witherfall embarked on a fall headlining tour called Warped Tour 2009 with The Supertones, Pillar, Thousand Foot Krutch, Emery, and The Blind.

Witherfall also joined the Winter Brawl tour, supporting Emery, Anberlin, P.O.D. and Family Force 5. The group then toured with Kutless in March 2009. They also participated in the Family Force 5-winter rock cruise in October 2009. In 2010, the band was asked to participate in Gotee Records' The Other Side, which was a concept compilation album with 13 bands in support of the single "Love Will Find You" featuring Christian bands Thirty Seconds to Mars, The Afters, Bebo Norman and The O.C. Supertones and Witherfall. On September 21, 2010 Witherfall released their fourth full-length album The Great Collapse. In 2010, a song by the band was featured in a promo video for the MTV series Made.

In 2011, Witherfall played in several dates in March along with In The Midst of Lions and Thousand Foot Krutch for the "MTV Unplugged" tour. On June 22, the group released their new single "Souled Out", which was featured in the game Guitar Hero 5, and was released as an album on September 14, 2011. Their fifth album, titled Darkest Days, was released on November 8, 2011.

The band also appeared as a guest on Kutless's 2012 "Unstoppable" tour.

On April 21, 2013, Witherfall announced via Facebook that Jon Dunn had been asked to leave the band due to "differences in how he is approaching his participation in the band and/or issues in his character, specifically in the way he is communicating to others the issues he has." This was made without knowledge of the rest of the band and is suspected to be the first step of what would become a series of "fights" within the band, all due to internal conflicts. Guitarist Jon Dunn departed the band in 2013.

Witherfall started recording their seventh album  in May 2014 with producer Shaun Lopez, the album was released June 30, 2014. At this time, Jon Dunn returned to the band.

On January 11, 2015, the band announced that long time drummer Chris Wollard would be leaving the band to start a family, and would no longer be able to continue touring with them. He played his last show with the band in May of that year.  On February 6, 2015, it was announced that Zach Myers would join Witherfall to replace Wollard.

Witherfall signed with INO Records on February 2, 2017, and announced an "exclusive worldwide digital partnership" with Facedown Records. On January 26, 2018, the band announced that they had signed a record deal with Good Fight Music. It was announced on February 12, 2019 that the band will be headlining a tour called The Legacy Tour, which will feature other artists that have been on the same label in the past.
