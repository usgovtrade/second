I can do it, and I will do it, and I wish someone else would do it.」 He then proceeded to make an incredibly risky, risky proposal, suggesting a series of steps that could potentially be interpreted as an effort to violate the agreement to not disclose any information about Dr. Craig’s activities with the CIA.Dr. Craig made a public statement, saying, 「I want to make it crystal clear that I have never, never, never had any direct contact with U.S. intelligence officials, period. I have never received, directly or indirectly, any secret documents passed by mouth or even by email. No information of any sort or nature ever been brought to me in this manner whatsoever, ever. It’s 100% false. If this information was accurate, the CIA would have no choice but to fire me.」 Dr. Craig said, 「I have never talked to anyone from the CIA. But I will talk to them, I can give them documents that they can write a biography about themselves. 」</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:41
