The accident occurred around 5:10 p.m. on Milwaukee Avenue between Adams Street and Wells Street and left five people with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. No serious injuries were reported, and the Chicago Fire Department said no one was transported to a hospital, according to police.

The Chicago Fire Department said several Chicago Police cars responded to the area after the crash and made sure everyone was transported to nearby hospitals to be checked out.

About six hours after the accident occurred, an empty Chicago Police car was spotted in the area, heading northbound on Wells Street, possibly in connection to the crash. It is unclear if the person driving was involved in the crash.

A spokesperson for Chicago police said there is no information about the crash at this time.

Area Central police said the Chicago Police Accident Unit responded to the scene, but it was only described as a “non-injury accident.”

The driver of the vehicle is described as a 5-foot-11, 135-pound black female between the ages of 20-29 years old, police said. The vehicle was driving northbound on Wells Street before it struck the building and rolled onto its roof.

It was not immediately known if anyone in the vehicle was arrested or injured in the crash, and police said the investigation is ongoing.

Anyone who may have witnessed the crash was urged to contact Area Central detectives at (312) 744-8386.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:05
