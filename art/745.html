you've taken a shit right in front of me." 
in reference to 
a dance break performed by actor 
seth rogen during his "family guy" 
appearance on the "titanic." 
it's a reference to the 
accusations that rogen made that 
the ship's sinking was planned. 
"it was a complete fabrication 
and a complete lie." 
i don't want to live on this 
earth anymore. 
(melissa) who are you talking to? 
what are you talking about? 
that's my sister. 
no, you're talking to...i mean, 
look what you're saying! 
i have to know the truth. 
we're really done. 
come here. 
i'll fucking kill you. 
okay. 
you're fucking lying. 
it's him or me. 
i have a beautiful family. 
yes, i am single. 
yes, i was married. 
but my marriage has gone on long 
enough. 
how did your wife leave? 
because i fuckin' cheated on her. 
is that what she said? 
and that's why she's divorcing me? 
why did she leave you? 
you guys saw me naked! 
i was skinny-dipping. 
oh, of course. 
are you kidding me? 
yeah. 
okay, so it wasn't about you 
having an affair with your 
personal trainer. 
whoa, so it wasn't about that? 
that's really great. 
oh, that's why she left you? 
that is great. 
thank you so much. 
i didn't do anything. 
thanks for the save, kid. 
i'm outta here. 
i'm sick of it. 
i can't take it anymore. 
just one question. 
what did she think about 
that? 
she didn't like it, but... 
(kelly) my father left me and 
my mom. 
and i'd say in the past, on an 
average, 
it's about five months. 
so i am going to be out, 
i mean, probably a couple of years. 
it's hard for me to explain. 
i was looking for a job, and 
i got pregnant. 
that's why i took off. 
my parents are very much involved 
in the baby's life. 
i get to see the baby when she's 
woken up from a nap, and 
she's on the phone, and 
she's giving the baby a bath. 
it's adorable. 
and it's cool. 
so, you're telling me that you 
didn't 
love her? 
my wife, i love her. 
but it was a different love. 
we fought, but it was very open. 
she wasn't a bad mother. 
she was a great mother. 
but she always wanted to be 
independent. 
so she had me take the 
children. 
we got divorced when she 
started dating my friend. 
who are you talking about? 
no, it's all right. 
no, it's not all right. 
if you want to do that to 
everybody, it's all right. 
no, it's not. 
i want you to have something 
truly 
special. 
i'm sorry. 
i don't want to talk about 
that. 
it's all right. 
it's just a little complicated. 
(vicki) i have no idea how to 
love a man. 
i'll be damned if i ever 
have kids. 
it's hard for me to 
remember. 
because 
i can't forget her. 
but i was like, "wow, that's 
beautiful." 
[ laughter ] i don't know. 
it's very hard for me to 
understand. 
[ cheers and applause ] 
you got 
some good dancers here, to be 
honest. 
we got a lot of, like, 
really- - 
you ever done this, man? 
i did the 
dancing. 
i used to be a professional 
dancer. 
me and my wife, we started in the 
sport. 
she's a badass, i'm a badass. 
the thing is is i'm good. 
but 
i'm a really good dancer. 
i used to be a go-go dancer. 
oh, when did she die? 
like, in the '70s? 
i feel like that's not badass, 
that's 
gross. 
that's gross. 
you're trying too hard. 
[ cheers and applause ]
