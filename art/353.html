I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
everything. You can't just walk in here and start 
messing with any of the computers." The fact that he 
spent all that time trying to figure out how to get to the 
computer on the second floor makes me wonder if this 
gentleman may have some experience in computer hacking. 
Mr. Blythe: I'm a professor of linguistics. 
Kari Byron: Really? 
Mr. Blythe: Yeah. 
Kari Byron: Could I have a look at your 
credentials? 
Mr. Blythe: Oh. My 
computer is over there. 
Kari Byron: Where's your I.D.? 
Mr. Blythe: I've got it. 
Kari Byron: Let me see it. 
Mr. Blythe: How's my hair look? 
[ Laughter ] 
Mr. Blythe: So this is what I'm used to doing. 
Kari Byron: This is really good stuff, though. 
Mr. Blythe: Oh. 
Kari Byron: You're a professor. I've never 
actually met a professor before. 
Mr. Blythe: Why 
is that? 
Kari Byron: You're the first professor 
I've ever met. 
Mr. Blythe: It's 
just so. 
Kari Byron: Maybe you can teach me how 
to hack into computers. 
Mr. Blythe: Oh, I 
don't know about that. 
Kari Byron: You don't know how to do it? 
[ Laughter ] 
Mr. Blythe: You're doing great. 
Kari Byron: Are you hacking the system 
up there? 
Mr. Blythe: Yes, I am. 
Kari Byron: That's pretty cool. 
Mr. Blythe: I went up 
there because I was curious to see what he was doing 
and, in case you want to know, he is just trying to 
access files on the computer. He doesn't seem to be 
doing anything wrong. 
Kari Byron: Well, I'll have to keep that in 
mind. 
Mr. Blythe: I have some students come into my 
class that don't 
know how to turn on a computer. 
[ Laughter ] 
Mr. Blythe: But anyway, he's just sitting there, and I 
came in here, and I thought I'd watch this guy, you 
know? 
Kari Byron: All right. 
Mr. Blythe: So I see this girl come into the coffee shop, 
and I think, "All right." 
[ Laughter ] 
Mr. Blythe: The next thing you know, there's 
this -- 
Kari Byron: All right, I'm out of here. 
[ Laughter ] 
Kari Byron: I've got a meeting. 
Mr. Blythe: Anyway, I'm watching this guy, 
and -- 
Kari Byron: You're the teacher. 
Mr. Blythe: I don't do anything. 
Kari Byron: Why did you take my book? 
Mr. Blythe: I didn't take your book. I was watching him. 
Kari Byron: But why did you read it? 
Mr. Blythe: I 
don't know. 
Kari Byron: That's kind of weird. 
Mr. Blythe: I didn't want to 
stand out. 
Kari Byron: All right. 
[ Laughter ] 
Mr. Blythe: So now I am up here, and I figure, "Let me just, 
you know, maybe ask him for his business card." So I 
come back over here, and he doesn't have a business 
card, so I say, "Give me a business card," and he 
says, "Well, I don't have one." 
Kari Byron: Oh, 
no. 
Mr. Blythe: I mean, 
some people think that the card is meant for the 
business. 
Kari Byron: Really? 
Mr. Blythe: Yeah, that's just one of those idiosyncrasies 
that I have. 
Kari Byron: We haven't introduced our 
student -- 
Mr. Blythe: Oh, I'm the instructor. 
Kari Byron: Oh, 
yeah, sorry. Our student. I mean, I guess we could bring 
him up here, if he would like. 
Mr. Blythe: Well, now he's -- 
Kari Byron: He seems like a nice kid. 
Mr. Blythe: I don't know him well enough. 
Kari Byron: You never had lunch with him? 
Mr. Blythe: No. 
Kari Byron: You don't know him that well. 
Mr. Blythe: I never tried him. 
Kari Byron: Maybe we could try it. Maybe we could 
try him out. 
Mr. Blythe: What about what I do? 
Kari Byron: What 
do you mean? 
Mr. Blythe: I mean, what do you mean about 
try? 
Kari Byron: I mean, do we know him? 
Mr. Blythe: I 
have just watched him with this computer, and I have seen 
you come out here, but, you know, you 
see a lot of people. 
Kari Byron: You have just seen him 
in the computer lab. 
Mr. Blythe: Are you 
trying to tell me that he's just been sitting at the 
computer all day? 
Kari Byron: What about when I walked by? 
Mr. Blythe: There are 
thousands of 
people walking past there. 
Kari Byron: All right. 
Mr. Blythe: I mean, he 
must have been doing something. 
Kari Byron: Oh. 
Mr. Blythe: Somebody was messing with the computer 
by hitting keys. 
Kari Byron: It's just 
been here all day, typing. 
Mr. Blythe: He's been 
here all day in the computer lab? 
Kari Byron: Yeah, but if you look around 
the building, there's hundreds and hundreds of computer 
labs and people using them, so I don't know what you're 
trying to say about him. 
Mr. Blythe: Well, I'm saying 
that there's an extraordinary effort 
around here to take care of all these computers, and, 
you know, sometimes I think that it's very strange that 
when we do this, we get called into meetings, and we're 
interviewed by the police and by people from the local 
paper, and, you know, I mean, I guess that's to some 
extent understandable, because they are doing something 
wrong. 
And then there are all the people who 
work here, and there's, you know, 
this guy who runs into 
here and uses the computer, and maybe it's because he 
doesn't have a computer, you know? I 
mean, there's probably a ton of people who are 
not even involved with computers, and they would think, 
you know, that it's silly. 
But anyway, my point is that a lot of the time we get 
interviewed, and I think people are curious. I think 
people wonder what the computer lab is doing. We don't 
even have any signs that say that you can come in and 
use the computer here. It's more like the 
computer lab is 
hiding in plain sight. You walk by, and you think, "There's 
a computer over there." You walk past the 
computer lab, and you think, "There's no computers 
here." 
Kari Byron: Yeah, it's pretty much a secret. 
Mr. Blythe: They are just 
plainly in plain sight, and I think that 
they're being handled, too. I just -- I think there's a 
lot of unnecessary stuff around here. I think people 
don't 
understand that -- 
Kari Byron: Do you think he was typing something? 
Mr. Blythe: I don't know. I didn't ask 
him. 
Kari Byron: Oh. 
Mr. Blythe: Okay, here is something for you, as 
the student. 
Kari Byron: You think he's lying? 
Mr. Blythe: I think he's lying, and I don't think he 
cares</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:27
