They are likely to have to cope with the effects of MST for the rest of their lives. The health care professionals responsible for the treatment, follow-up and rehabilitation of patients with MST-related diseases will have to be prepared for the needs of the growing population of these patients and will require access to appropriate medical information and ongoing education. The study also clearly indicated that it would be beneficial to review the health care system and the policies adopted in the past to deal with patients with MST-related diseases. Although it will be difficult, such reappraisal should be performed.

There was also clear evidence that the burden of the disease did not end after treatment was completed, as some participants suffered both short and long-term complications and were still receiving various treatments. The long-term results should also be a concern of the medical professionals responsible for the treatment of the disease.

Limitations
-----------

The small sample size of this study and its single center design limited our ability to generalize the results and conclusions. However, the data are representative of a population in a developing country. In addition, the age range of the participants is wide and therefore the sample is representative of children from the first year of life to adulthood, which increases the applicability of the findings to this study population.

Conclusion
==========

Although MST-related diseases are complex and serious, children can be treated and return to normal life, as MST is relatively new. Therefore, early diagnosis and good monitoring are important. Although the study used multiple perspectives of the lived experience of MST-related diseases, it should be interpreted in the light of these limitations.

We wish to thank all the MST patients and their families for the contribution to this study and for sharing their experiences. We would also like to thank all medical professionals in the Poursina Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, especially the pediatric residents and specialists for their kind cooperation. The project was supported by the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran (grant No. 396043).
