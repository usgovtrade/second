The band has begun working on new music for their third full-length album.  In an interview with Exclaim!, Domenic Palermo and Dave Scarpulla said that "You can hear that we are doing new shit and we can't wait to start putting that shit out!"

During their 2012 European Tour, the band appeared on BBC's The Stig of the Dump show.

Critical reception

"Every Man for Himself" has received mixed reviews by critics. Alternative Press reviewer J.R. Moores remarked the album "isn’t the album to pick up if you’re looking to hear what the future of indie rock looks like." He believed that the album is "a bit like the kids who take piano lessons but only learn how to play 'Begin the Beguine'. The material is pleasant but unmemorable. Even as a fan of the band, I couldn't help but feel a little let down by this record". Matt Collar from Allmusic commended the album by saying that the album is "a triumph in modern pop punk, and a powerful look forward for the genre." He concluded his review by claiming "It's clear that the writing has improved since the band's inception – so much so that Weezer now has an open-ended future, whether that be with this lineup, or if they decide to try something new".

In an unfavourable review, Consequence of Sound's Ryan E.C. Hamm said that "With 'Weezer,' the band has created more of a hybrid than they have with their other albums". He also said that "Weezer creates an aura of confidence by letting their influences shine through", though he noted "they seem in a rush to cram as many references to pop culture into their music as possible. They come across as desperate to prove how clever they are at this point".
