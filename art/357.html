Instead 
we have an all-out fight, 
in fact, at the very
beginning of the film.
Nicky, 
I've got to talk to you.
You come all the way out here, 
and then you run out on me, 
and you leave me hanging?
What happened?
I saw that guy.
A couple guys did.
Where the hell were you?
I just kept thinking of you.
Did you hear what I said? 
I was worried about you.
I think he went to my aunt.
 I want you out.
What?
My husband took off from the bank, 
so maybe I was wrong.
Anyway, no more house for you,
my cute little Nicky.
Don't worry about it.
You'll get the next.
Do you want me to 
go on the street?
Go take a hike, 
and don't ever come back. 
Bastard!
Go on, get out of here.
I thought you knew.
I thought you knew.
No.
What do you mean?
Oh, Nicky. 
Yeah, just some neighborhood 
girl I've known for a long time.
No, I don't know
what it means.
I didn't do anything to that 
woman, but he's got this thing
about women walking through 
the gate at night.
So he comes through, right? 
And this girl, she's 
walking her dog. 
I don't know what her problem is,
I mean, she's always there,
wanting to fuck. 
When her husband's 
away, which is all the time.
I'm going to make a drink.
Go ahead.
What if your dog 
is a real tough dog?
Tell him I'll fuck him if he 
hits the motherfucker.
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you gonna go for your gun? 
You gonna shoot me?
I'm sorry,
I was trying to help. 
Oh, go fuck your fuckin' mother.
Where you live? 
I'll come over and fuck you 
in your goddamned sleep. 
I'm sorry, Nicky.
Let's get out of here.
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
It's just not 
quite what I wanted.
I thought he was going 
to rape me.
It was not necessary.
In addition, my wife is not
going to be home tonight.
Oh, it'll be like tonight
only nothing happens.
I'll be in and out quick.
Don't worry.
We had a good time tonight.
I know.
It'll be just the way it was 
before I got to 
know your husband, Nicky. 
Sure you don't want a drink?
I'm going to my room.
Can I get you something?
No.
My husband will kill me
if he finds out.
I am sorry, Nicky. 
I didn't know 
who you were and what 
I was doing. 
You just seemed 
so nice to me, Nicky.
I don't want to kill you.
It's just that I don't want 
to die with it on my conscience 
that I slept with a wife 
of another man. 
I understand you 
might think about it.
That was the idea, 
was to get that thing on my finger
and not think too much. 
I want you to wear it. 
I'd feel much better about 
it if you would.
Just do me a favor, 
don't wear it in the house. 
It makes the kids nervous 
when they walk in there. 
I understand.
I really do, 
I think that that's what 
happens with the kids.
The other day, my son
saw me with this thing.
My daughter, too.
I don't know. 
My husband doesn't know 
about this at all.
He doesn't know a thing.
He'll never find out.
Look, I was thinking. 
Do you think 
you could say something 
to your husband 
about this? 
Do you think he would stop?
Yes, I think he would stop. 
He's probably been 
thinking something, too. 
It's hard to know 
what the other man does. 
When you want me to 
wear that ring, tell me. 
I'll wear it.
I'd really be glad if you wore it.
It's like I was telling you. 
He doesn't have a chance. 
You don't know about these 
other things that happen. 
Well, if you knew 
all the things that go on 
in people's minds. 
I don't know.
I don't want to, but I 
want to have something. 
I don't know why. 
You do, I don't want to talk about it. 
I've talked enough. 
Let's go.
You know I'm married.
Do you think I want it
on my conscience? 
That would be the part
you didn't want to talk about. 
You could've just said so.
I should've just kept quiet. 
I should've just kept quiet.
I'll go get the thing.
I'll be back in a minute.
Let me just get dressed. 
Do you have something?
Yes.
My husband, 
he brought me back 
from Los Angeles 
when I got sick. 
We came back from Los Angeles 
the day before yesterday. 
I never saw him 
with a drink, 
but I know that he's a drinker. 
He'll be drunk 
a lot of the time.
Sometimes he doesn't come home 
for three or four days at a time. 
I shouldn't have come here. 
I'm sorry I ever came.
I won't ever leave you. 
If you need anything, you ask 
me first before you go. 
It's your apartment.
You can do what you want to.
I don't want him 
to find us in the bed. 
Please don't go.
Can I just look at you?
I can see why 
my husband 
would do it 
to you 
if you really had a bad belly. 
I won't tell anybody.
I'll just leave 
if you want me to. 
And I'll leave my jewelry 
on the dresser 
as I found it. 
No one else knows I was here. 
I'll just be gone.
That'll be better.
You know, 
my husband should've 
killed you. 
He should've shot you down. 
I wanted you.
I wanted you so badly.
You know, 
it's got to be. 
You and I. 
You're the only man
I love. 
Nobody else can keep me. 
I know.
You got to help me.
He'd probably come home 
and you could say, "Look,
this man is here, he just killed
the dog that was barking at us.
But he's gone now.
Now we can be happy."
How can I help you?
Let me help you.
I won't bother you, 
I just want to stay here.
He'll find me if I stay here.
I can help you.
I can help you.
It's not a good idea.
Then we're both lost.
I could lose everything. 
My husband, 
my home. 
It's just that
everything is so unstable. 
I wish he could just
fucking die. 
But he won't. 
He just can't die. 
He's too stubborn.
But I can't get anything 
done with him. 
I mean, even though I love him.
Do you love him?
I'm going to leave now.
I'll go now.
Don't go.
Let's get some breakfast.
I'm hungry.
What do you want for breakfast?
He probably drinks 
during the day. 
It could start again at night.
He goes to get 
more whiskey.
He's not going to get home 
and think about it. 
Let's just stay here.
Just stay 
right here.
He'll be home soon.
He'll be back soon.
I can tell he's coming 
from a long ways off. 
See the way his car's shaking?
We're going to move over. 
It's just his car. 
That's the way the son of a bitch drives.
You should hear him 
when he drinks. 
You're the only person
I've been able to talk to. 
Then why does</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:27
