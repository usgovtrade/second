The purpose of this study was to identify differences between three groups: average intelligence (I.Q. < 85), high-average intelligence (I.Q. 85 to 115), and superior intelligence (I.Q. > 115). Women were selected by the criterion that all were within the same occupation and had the same income, level of education, years in the same occupation, and type of job, i.e., office work with a managerial status. The subjects were also within the same sociocultural and ethnic group. All were married or living in common-law marriages. Questionnaires were sent to those selected to obtain additional information, but the present study was based only on the information contained in the survey questionnaire. Analysis of the data suggested that women of average intelligence were more satisfied with their financial situation, and lived in more stable, better educated homes than women of high intelligence. It was also found that the women of average intelligence were more financially secure and less depressed than the women of superior intelligence. Implications for the counseling and the management of these women are discussed.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:04
