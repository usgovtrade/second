Subject: EES Customer Service Agreement Amendment

Per my previous e-mail, attached is the latest revised customer service 
agreement from ENA.  Please review this and advise of any changes you may 
need to our form.  We would like to send this out today.  As I mentioned 
before, we will send the executed copy of this agreement to EES upon 
execution by ENA.

Thanks!

Hayes
