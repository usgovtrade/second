most tragic, narratives of the life of the French Revolution, is that
written by the young and spirited son of a prelate--the Abbe de Lamennais.
The father was a Roman Catholic prelate, and from his family the
author inherited his religious faith. Lamennais became deeply impressed
with the ideas of the Reformation, and, entering on the career of a
theologian, he preached a kind of free-thought. After a time he broke
with the Roman Church, and declared himself a Protestant. This change
of creed was naturally followed by a complete change of conduct. The
Abbe became devoted to the cause of freedom, and threw himself into the
midst of every revolutionary movement. But during the revolution of 1830
he was cruelly maltreated by the authorities, and he suffered so much
that his health was greatly impaired, so that when the revolution came
to an end he was still more embittered against the Catholic Church, and
more and more deeply plunged into revolutionary ideas. His mind became
overwhelmed with new convictions. His religious faith was lost, his
political faith was shaken, and a great sense of social despair settled
on his soul, through the ruin of his hopes of earthly progress and
happiness. "I am convinced," he says, "that the faith of Christ is not
the universal remedy for all evil; that our age is not one in which the
power of miracles can revive in human hearts; that there is a God for
me, just as there is for everyone else; that there is a divine providence
alike over all; but that man has broken with this providence, and I am
conscious of being abandoned by it." He goes on to say, "If I believed in
a supernatural mission for the clergy I should still be a Christian; I
would then call upon God to save this country, for the misfortunes of
religion would be but the instrument of the progress of good." It was
his deep faith in the supernatural mission of Christianity, which was
lost through the change in his ideas, that gave such a fervor and energy
to his utterances in condemnation of Christianity. In those days he was
a man of powerful and even brilliant eloquence, and no small part of his
fame was due to the eloquence of his sermons. "I have often," he says,
"heard at the opera fine and pathetic scenes from Shakespeare's plays,
but never did I hear such fine scenes as those I heard that year, in the
midst of the most horrible catastrophes. The most tragic day in my life
is that day on which I quitted a society that had become impossible for
me to bear any longer. I am sure I have never, not even in my worst
moments, sinned against men. Every crime I have ever committed has been
against mankind--against those who claimed to speak for it, and in the
name of it. In this sense, I am and have been the enemy of mankind." In
one of his last works he gave vent to his profound horror of the moral
ruin that came over him through his revolutionary hatred of the Church.
In a work entitled _Essai sur la Liberté de Penser_, in which he tried
to define his intellectual and social convictions, he wrote, "There is no
longer any truth; there are no longer any principles but the principles
of liberty and equality. In Europe, there are neither great men nor great
cities nor great events; only a great political revolution has been made
from end to end, and there has been accomplished the greatest confusion
of things that could be found among mankind. In one part of Europe, the
taste for the beautiful has abandoned painting and sculpture; in another,
it has abandoned poetry; in another, it has abandoned music. In one
country it has abandoned the love of children, in another it has abandoned
the love of truth. The world is broken into atoms, life is dead, art is
dead, truth is dead. Those who made this revolution have made a revolution
in the nature of humanity, a revolution as complete as the one which is
imprinted in our eyes by the lightning which blinds us. Every morning
the whole human race rises and begins a new life. But the human race
that arose this morning has nothing in common with the human race that
arose yesterday. . . . Where is the truth that remains among us? Among
those who had least faith in the old doctrine, there is no longer any
such doctrine. It has been condemned by the people of this country in
a great political assembly which may be the more correctly called a
revolution. I was there to give my vote, and the majority was against it.
The great revolution that has overthrown the ancient order of things has
also overthrown all those things that made Christianity possible; the
great revolution has destroyed the very idea of God." This may seem an
immoderate statement. But it is to be remembered that Lamennais at this
time was a mere boy of twenty-two, and very immature in thought and
feeling. It must also be borne in mind that the violence and intensity
with which the revolution went on, and the fury of the contest against
Christianity which the revolutionists in France carried on for a long
period, made it well nigh impossible to think of religion except as a
pretext and a form of hypocrisy. It was when a reaction against this
contest had set in that Lamennais first came forward as an apostle of
religion. And no one can feel any doubt that if the revolutionary
movement had been allowed to continue for any length of time, it would
have destroyed Christianity. It is to the infinite credit of the
civilization of France that, after the terrible shock and the furious
and unprincipled anarchy of the time, there should have come a reaction
which placed men in such deep distress that the religious element had
to come to the help of the moral and social life of the nation, and to
supply a solid foundation for the work of social reconstruction. There is
no doubt that this was an extraordinary movement of the social elements
in France to which nothing like it had ever occurred before. The movement
has been often described. It seemed as if nothing could be left for
a man to trust to but religion. Not only was there no truth left for
us, but there was no right in things, nothing worthy of respect and
conformity. One by one, almost, the old foundations of social morality
and social law crumbled to nothingness, until the very foundations of
morality seemed to be undermined. This was only a symbol of the moral
ruin of men's minds, a symbol of the moral destitution that had come over
the people. Such a condition of things made men eager to seek for a
basis of all things in religion, and it was through the restoration of
Christianity to the French nation that a great moral movement was carried
out. On the one hand, there is every reason to believe that if this
tremendous social revolution had been continued longer, or if other
revolutionary tendencies had prevailed, Christianity would have been
swept away, and with it morality, and all hope of regeneration. But as a
matter of fact, the tendency was checked by the very intensity and moral
ferocity of the revolution itself, and out of the reaction that followed,
the revival of religion took place.

The _Réforme_, by which many moderate Catholics turned to the Church,
served to revive the idea of the supernatural, and to supply a basis for
a new and more religious and moral conception of the relation of God to
man. If this was the result of the reaction from the social excesses of
the Revolution, it was all the more remarkable because the revolution
itself and the reaction did not originate in the Church. It was an old
and very respectable Church which came forward to save France, and
for the most part it was conservative and not revolutionary in its
tendencies. It was not the work of the upper classes, who had often
been hostile to religion, and it was not the work of the middle or lower
classes who had had little or no experience of religion. It was the work
of a class just rising into importance--the middle classes--the people
with whom the Church was most in sympathy, and among whom the religious
sentiment was strongest. The events of the Revolution had taught the
people that there was truth in religion, and this truth had been put
to a severe test. They had found that there were certain truths
essential to their moral and social life. When religion was assailed,
it taught them that there were other truths than those of secular
morality and secular government which were essential to the happiness
and welfare of man. What seemed to them to be the real truth was not
fighting the truth of religion; it was fighting those elements which had
seemed to them to have made it impossible for religion to do its work.
When this class came forward to help religion, the time for resistance
was past. Christianity had triumphed not only in the hearts of those
who had fought for it, but in the minds and hearts of the world at large.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:02
