Laparoscopy has become the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment of patients with early stage ovarian cancer, borderline ovarian tumors, and uterine fibroids. These include myoma uteri, benign ovarian cysts, and many other gynecologic disorders. Furthermore, laparoscopic procedures are generally faster and require less pain medication. The laparoscopic approach for management of early stage ovarian tumors includes resection of ovarian tumors that were not able to be removed by laparotomy or that had a malignancy discovered postoperatively. Laparoscopic resection is especially indicated in women who wish to preserve their fertility and is best performed in a stepwise fashion, with the objective of decreasing tissue trauma, while at the same time increasing the removal rate. The surgeon can proceed with enucleation when there is a single large tumor. When multiple smaller tumors are present or there are few visible tumors on the ovary, the surgeon can proceed with removal of the adnexa (adnexectomy). Large, solid masses can be enucleated, morcellated, or morcellated with bag or basket retrieval in order to obtain a pathologic specimen. In some patients, intraoperative cystoscopy can help the surgeon locate the cyst as a possible source of the metastatic disease. In the case of advanced ovarian tumors that are invasive, there is a higher risk of recurrence. In these cases, the surgeon must excise the adnexa (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) and remove all abnormal areas of the omentum (omentectomy), and peritoneal biopsies can be performed. If there is any possibility of invasive cancer, then the patient should undergo comprehensive surgical staging to assess for complete surgical staging, as well as the status of the lymph nodes. Intraoperative cystoscopy, or morcellation of solid tumors, is performed to assess for extraovarian disease. For patients with large, bilateral ovarian tumors, which are unlikely to be removed intact through a single incision, a bilateral adnexectomy is performed. For patients with both ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma, the surgeon excises the adnexa and removes the greater omentum to evaluate for small peritoneal implants.
FIGS. 1A and 1B show the surgical specimen in situ. FIG. 1A is a side view of a specimen from a laparotomy demonstrating the incision and resection of the tissues between the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes. FIG. 1B is an expanded view of the ovaries and fallopian tubes from FIG. 1A. FIG. 2 shows a typical view of a specimen of a patient after an ovary has been morcellated, demonstrating the normal tissue, including follicles and interstitial tissue between the follicles (the stroma), as well as the follicles themselves. FIG. 3 shows a representative portion of the biopsy specimens in FIG. 2. The specimen in FIG. 3 can also be seen in FIG. 1B. The FIG. 3 specimen demonstrates a normal ovary and several corpus luteum (CL) as well as several follicles and interstitial tissue between follicles (stroma). FIG. 4 shows another portion of FIG. 3, demonstrating interstitial tissue between follicles as well as the stroma. FIG. 5 is an expanded view of the tissues shown in FIG. 4, with the stroma from the follicle/stroma tissue, and the epithelium from the follicles with germinal centers. FIG. 5 shows that the stroma is surrounded by a boundary between the follicle epithelium and the stroma. FIG. 6A-6D show the different ways that a single cell can be represented in the figures as seen in FIGS. 5 and 1B. FIG. 6A is an expanded view of a single cell from FIG. 5. FIGS. 6B-6D are expanded views of the different components of FIG. 6A, showing that the same cell is shown as different forms based on these components, with different colors used to represent the different components. FIG. 6C shows the cell as epithelium that surrounds a stroma, with the stroma shown in red. FIG. 6D shows the cell as a single cell surrounded by stroma, with the stroma shown in red. FIG. 6E shows the cell with stroma that has two distinct layers, the stroma being shown in red. The FIG. 6E stroma is different than FIG. 6C and FIG. 6D. FIGS. 6A-6D show that a single cell can be represented in many different ways. FIGS. 6E-6H show an example of how an entire follicle from a tissue sample can be represented in a computer system. FIG. 7A shows a side view of a follicle in situ, demonstrating that the follicle has an outer layer (mural) as well as an inner layer. FIG. 7A shows the single layer of epithelium as shown in FIG. 6A. FIG. 7B shows that the single layer of epithelium can be expanded to form a second layer of epithelium, which extends further toward the inside of the follicle and touches the wall of the follicle in FIG. 7A. FIG. 7C shows a single layer of epithelial cells that has two layers. The outer layer is red and the inner layer is green. The outer layer and inner layers of the cell are separated by stroma and stroma is shown in different shades of gray. The FIG. 7C green inner layer is between the red outer layer and the gray stroma. FIGS. 7D and 7E demonstrate that the same cell can have different shapes based on which components are selected to be visible. FIG. 7D shows the cell expanded to only show the stroma as a result of selecting the stroma as a component. FIG. 7E shows the cell expanded to only show the epithelium as a result of selecting the epithelium as a component.
Despite having had major advancements in recent years, there still remains a need for improved surgical tools and systems for determining the histology of a tissue in a patient, including those that have been treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:31
