will not be responsible for what I do."

"Do not be so hasty. You will have to come with me, to take your place as 
a member of the guard. I promise not to use force unless you try to harm 
me."

"You will use force, for the force is in yourself, the force of a violent 
mind. You are violent. What you are you are; what you will be, you will 
be. What you are afraid of is a truth, Mr. Reade, and you are afraid of 
it. Now, will you get up at once?"

"I cannot help that, and therefore I will not get up. Now be quick."

"I have told you what I thought. You have shown me your face. Now I will 
throw a handkerchief at you."

"Why?"

"You shall see. When you put your hands up to defend yourself, your coat 
will be torn."

"Come on!" I roared, turning pale and growing faint.

"Stop! We will stop a minute. Do you know, Mr. Reade, you have no right 
to remain in this house, in which you have broken in so improperly?"

"I am here by the invitation of the master of the house," I replied.

"The master of the house has not spoken to you yet, and he may speak as 
ill of your behavior as I now do."

"All I have to say to him concerns me only, and has nothing to do with 
him. He is the master of the house, the owner of the estate, not I. My 
action has been legal."

"It is not legal. It is unlawful. At least, you ought not to have broken 
in in this manner, or to have broken a thing that is a part of a legal 
transaction. I intend to make you, sir, an example of what I intend to do 
to all your kind. Leave this place. Now."

"I will not."

"You are about to be beaten into submission by a lady?"

"My dear Madam, I am no coward. If I ever was, my cowardice is ended; at 
least for that period of my life. One of the duties of a man is to give 
chastisement to his fellows. I have done you and Mr. Bulwer as much of 
this duty as I care to do; at least you have a great deal more to answer 
for than I have. But I will tell you what you ought to have done. You 
ought to have seen me privately and told me you were dissatisfied with 
me. You ought not to have tried to frighten me with vague threats. You 
ought not to have called in the help of men to whom the management of a 
house is a matter of business. If you had done so, this would not have 
happened. I would have borne your threats calmly; they would have had no 
charm for me; I would have gone out of your house willingly, even glad to 
be quit of you. My feeling towards you at this moment, however, is as 
well expressed by my words to the man to whom I spoke first, with whom I 
had no quarrel. I mean I love you not."

My voice had risen as I said this, and my eyes had lightened with wrath, 
and flashed; when, at the word "love," Miss Nightingale uttered a cry, 
and looked at me; and when I added, "I love you not," she turned quite 
pale.

"Come down-stairs," I said to her, "for, being a lady, you do not know 
that a man, for aught you can say to him, can have a leg to stand upon 
till he sees yours, your skirt, or your feet, and, when he has done that, 
can kick him to a good round distance. Come down, and take your turn, and 
I promise you you shall not get off so easily. Come, I have my first 
whipping to get, and, as you seem so anxious to fight with me, I will 
begin."

I turned round and went, and Miss Nightingale was by my side. But, 
strange to say, she did not stir to come with me, but she said:

"But I have not the power to do that. It would be a great sin."

"You could not do it without sinning, or you could not do it if I were 
to let you," I answered, and so left her.

She stood stock still for a minute.

"Oh!" she sighed, "I could beat him! I could beat him! And now I dare not 
touch him. He is so big and strong. I wish that some one would beat him 
for me, for now that I hate him, I have still a good heart, and would not 
hurt a fly for his sake."

There was a heavy step on the stairs at that moment, and Miss Nightingale 
said:

"Ah! Here is Mr. Bulwer," and without looking again at me, rushed 
down-stairs, leaving me to follow her or not as I pleased, for she had 
not given me time to give my order.

Mr. Bulwer had come in hot, and had taken the opportunity of Mr. Grim's 
absence to break out in the most violent manner against me and Mr. 
Maitland.

"What is this! What do I hear? Reade, you and Maitland must go out of 
this. I will not have either of you stay here. You have done it. I can 
hardly credit your insolence."

"Then you are very unjust to me, sir," I said, "for I did nothing 
unbecoming a man. Do not let us, on my account, continue to quarrel 
amongst ourselves. We may as well stop. So long as we remain together, we 
may as well continue to know one another."

"That we will not, sir. Do you dare to be insolent to me again, Mr. 
Reade? Do you dare to speak to me?"

"I will speak to you, sir, if I please," I said.

Mr. Bulwer turned away and walked about the room, fuming and raging. I 
followed him and faced him at last.

"Mr. Bulwer, I am still in your service, and I will do as you wish."

"You are a most incomprehensible man. Your very presence seems to put me 
in the wrong."

"But you have been in the wrong before, and yet no man has the right to 
say so, save for the purpose of trying to come into the right again."

"I will not have Mr. Maitland stay here," Bulwer broke out again.

"Then I must take the liberty of saying that I will stay here, and of 
repeating that I have done nothing to be kicked out of the house for."

"What! Insolent man! insolent to Mr. Bulwer! Mr. Reade."

"I did not speak to you, Mr. Bulwer, but I spoke to you. I said I would 
do as you like."

"I will not have it. You say too much, sir. You cannot be permitted to 
say what you are saying here. You must not stay here. You must go to your 
room. I do not wish to see you again."

"Mr. Bulwer, that is an impertinence, which I will not endure."

"It is an insolence that I will not put up with."

"Then let me tell you, you insolent puppy, that you are no better than a 
swaggerer, a bully, a tyrant, a bad, cruel man, unworthy to rule a 
herd, and that your authority in this house ought to be at an end 
to-morrow."

I had been so provoked that I did not know what I was saying, or I should 
have more properly used the word "dare" instead of "say."

"Insolent man! Insolent!" cried Mr. Bulwer.

"That is not your last word," I said; and I turned from him, left the 
room, and went up-stairs.

I had hardly got into my own room when Mr. Grim came up. He was in a 
state of excitement, for the servant had told him what had happened, and 
he had hastened up to see how it had ended. He had not much time to give 
to me now, for the servant had soon made him aware that I was within, and 
had let him know that I was ill, and so was waiting for him.

"Well," he began, "is it so, Reade</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:29
