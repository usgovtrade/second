Until we are better than the rest. This led to a strong product range that was sold under many well known brands.
As time went on, more and more of the smaller manufacturers started to sell their products under their own brand. It is a common story, but it did end up leaving us in a bit of a financial mess.
Our company moto was: Good, better, best, never will we rest.
For the past seven years we have had to restructure, but have managed to remain in the market by selling off non profitable parts of our business and focussing on what we are good at: Selling high performance parts for the high performance enthusiast.
In the year 2002 we were approached by an American company who were looking to bring their products into the European market. They sold us their entire product range and in 2003 we moved into our new factory in Ayrshire, Scotland.
Throughout this time, our core business of selling high performance parts for the High Performance enthusiast, continued to grow.
For many years, we have been a major player in the high performance market on-line. We now have many thousands of satisfied customers around the world and are considered by many to be a leading supplier of brake and clutch parts for VAG based vehicles.
We are not resting on our laurels. We intend to build on what has been achieved so far and bring even better products and services to the market.
We value all our customers and offer high levels of customer support wherever you are in the world.
Customer reviews can be found on our website as well as other websites that will be added over time. All of these sites offer you our customers a chance to give their honest opinion of the products and services that we have supplied.
Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or would like more information.

As a part of the ongoing series of ‘Firsts in the World’, India has successfully tested a short range surface to surface missile on Tuesday, March 5, 2013. The surface-to-surface missile will help in boosting defence preparedness in the Northeast, particularly Arunachal Pradesh.
It is a short range surface-to-surface missile, having a length of 7.5 metres and can be launched from both wheeled and tracked platforms. This has a maximum range of 60 kilometers and has already been inducted into the Indian Army.
Speaking about the mission Suresh Kumar said, “This successful test launch of Prithvi Ballistic Missile was carried out from Wheeler Island off Odisha coast as part of regular training exercise by Strategic Force Command of Indian Army.” He also added that it is a first of its kind missile to be tested from an Indian platform since it is not yet indigenously developed.
The surface to surface ballistic missile is capable of delivering nuclear and conventional warheads with high precision. It is equipped with advanced inertial navigation system and advanced navigation system with its own inertial guidance and manoeuvring unit. It has a maximum range of 500 km and can carry a warhead weighing 700 kg. The system uses both solid fuel and liquid propellant to power it. Launching facilities are available both on ground and shipboard, which allows to operate from all our Naval platforms.
On 27 February 2013, the Indian Army said that two soldiers have been killed in an ambush by Pakistan-backed rebels in eastern India's insurgency-hit Jammu region. The incident took place at about 1:30 am (local time) on Friday near Jagdamba Tiger Force's post in the border district of Mendhar. The soldiers were guarding the boundary when they were fired at by militants who were hidden in the bushes on the Pakistani side, an army spokesman told Reuters.
Meanwhile, an official spokesman said there has been no ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu region for the past two days. “A group of terrorists was detected at Jagdamba. A patrol was sent to counter them. But they were intercepted.
Two Army personnel lost their lives in this cross-border attack and two militants were also killed,” a police officer said. Meanwhile, Pakistan Army released a statement expressing deep concern over the killing of its soldiers along the LoC by Indian troops in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Dawn News reported on 26 February 2013.
The statement claimed that eight soldiers were killed and seven injured during this incident, but India refused to acknowledge the death of its personnel. On 27 February 2013, India called off talks between its foreign and defence ministers and Pakistan amid tension along the border between the two countries.
Earlier, in an official statement, Indian External Affairs Ministry said, “We hope for constructive engagement with Pakistan and express our desire to engage constructively with them on all issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. However, it is a concern to us that Pakistani authorities have once again resorted to unprovoked firing of small arms and automatic weapons and shelling of the Indian side of the Line of Control.”
Kashmiris were observing the second day of the shutdown in protest against the recent killings of civilians, security personnel and militants. The Indian government announced a Rs 100 crore relief package to the families of the martyred soldiers. It was reported that there has been no ceasefire violation along the LoC in Jammu region for two days.
On 27 February 2013, India’s government announced a Rs 100 crore relief package to the families of the martyred soldiers in a statement by Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar. The scheme will provide financial assistance worth Rs 4 lakh to each martyred soldier’s family with a house, two acres of land and one government job for one family member in any notified trade or profession.
The minister of state for home, Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, announced this at a press conference in New Delhi after a high-level meeting of the government. Ahir said that there are total 2,900 people martyred in cross-border firing since 2001 and “they all deserve similar package for their families”. He added, “I would request the concerned to start the process immediately”. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s military spokesperson Maj Gen Asim Bajwa expressed his concern over recent killings of its soldiers by Indian troops along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu region.
On 27 February 2013, he said that “unprovoked firing” by India’s troops killed eight Pakistani soldiers along the LoC in Jammu region. This is just the latest incident between the two nuclear-armed neighbours over recent years. However, neither side has admitted that its soldiers were killed, according to The Express Tribune. “We have conveyed our concerns to the Indian authorities,” he said. “We have demanded a flag meeting and to resume composite dialogue between the two countries”.
Kumar said that Indian Army has been given full freedom in the matter of ceasefire violations. This decision was taken at a high-level meeting between the union home ministry and defence ministry in New Delhi on 27 February 2013.
According to the spokesperson, security forces will not be bound by any guidelines to restrain from using full force against infiltrators. “The entire country expects security forces to use maximum force to deal with the situation effectively as the lives of jawans are precious,” Kumar said. He also added that there has been an increase in infiltration from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) this year.
As the ceasefire violations are taking place on an almost daily basis along the LoC in Jammu region, Indian army has decided to issue orders to all its units to shoot at sight along the LoC to foil infiltration bids.
The decision to issue such orders came after six civilians were killed and 10 injured in the past one month due to Pakistani ceasefire violations along the LoC. However, the Home Ministry officials told The Hindu that the decision to shoot at sight was taken only for special forces who deal with high-value targets, not for soldiers along the border.
The Indian Army will also continue to stop Pakistani nationals who enter into India without valid papers, and hand them over to the police. According to reports, two Indians and one Pakistani were arrested from Samba area on 26 February 2013 in such cases. The two Indians were suspected of being involved in stone pelting on the security forces during the past one year.
On 27 February 2013, the United States (US) President Barack Obama has urged Pakistan’s political leadership to take decisive action against terrorist groups operating from within their territory. He made this statement during a meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:28
