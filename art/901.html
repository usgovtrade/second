even thinking of such a thing," said Gweneth.

It was then that the doorbell rang and the four of them made their way 
downstairs.  Tiffany and her mother were in the hall getting out the answer 
to the door while the rest of the party was in the kitchen getting something 
to drink.  With that, Dwayne opened the front door to admit a redheaded 
woman wearing a light green sweater and jeans.  "Who is it?" said an annoyed 
Tiffany.

"It's a woman named Tanya," said Dwayne.

"Dwayne, why can't I come out of the bathroom in here?" asked Tiffany.  "You 
and Mom always let me out when there's someone else here."

"Tiffany, mommy and I need to talk with this woman," said Gweneth.  "We'll be 
right out." 
Gweneth and Tiffany went into the living room where Tanya was already 
seated. Dwayne and Robin went upstairs to change into a long johns and short 
shorts combination. 
Tanya introduced herself and sat on the couch while Gweneth introduced Dwayne 
and Robin. 
"Gweneth," said Tanya, "I didn't know your husband was a dwarf." 
"No one does," said Gweneth. "Tiffany is just used to it. She has a cousin 
that's a dwarf and is used to him being her father's servant." 
"I guess if you really knew each other you would have noticed I am 
taller," said Dwayne. 
"Oh, no, I still didn't realize you were a dwarf," said Tanya. "I just assumed 
you were a giant." 
Gweneth laughed and said, "We call that big." 
"If my ex-girlfriend found out I was a dwarf she would be so embarrassed," 
said Dwayne. "But don't worry; your parents will be here in about 15 minutes. 
They're just going to watch me take a shower. That's when you'll find out if 
I'm a dwarf or giant." 
Gweneth and Tiffany came downstairs dressed in shorts and beach shirts. 
"Hey, Tanya, my name is Gweneth, and that's my mom," said Gweneth. "Now it 
makes sense why you thought Dwayne was her ex-husband. She told me your 
father named you after a character on a soap opera so you could say your name 
out loud." 
"My parents named me Tanya and they didn't know that the actress on the soap 
opera was called Tanya," said Tanya. "So they never saw the show." 
"That's all right, Tanya," said Gweneth, "you can call me mom." 
"Tiffany, you can call me Gweneth if you want," said Tanya. "It's not that 
long of a name." 
"Then do you have any brothers or sisters?" asked Gweneth. 
"No, it's just me," said Tanya. 
"How are you doing?" asked Gweneth. 
"Not too good," said Tanya. "We lived in the same city I guess you could say 
but I didn't know who my father was. I found him out in a grocery store when I 
was 14 years old." 
"You had a father that you didn't know about," said Tiffany, "and didn't have 
until today?" 
"Yeah," said Tanya. 
"But that doesn't seem fair," said Tiffany. 
"No, but it's better than some kids who never find out who their father is," 
said Gweneth. 
"I wish I had someone like you and mom," said Tanya. 
"Yeah, we want to make sure that you have a stable home and family," said 
Gweneth. 
"That's what I figured," said Tanya. "Do you have a husband, like Tiffany's 
dad?" 
"Well, no," said Gweneth. "Tiffany's dad never married again. I wish he had. 
We never got along." 
"Gweneth, why didn't you tell me?" said Tiffany. 
"What's the use?" said Gweneth. "We had just come to an agreement to be with 
you and mom. We're the best parents you've ever had. Isn't that what you said 
to me the other day?" 
"It's too late to change my mind," said Gweneth. 
"If you want to take us back, we'll be here to try to find a way to get back 
together," said Tiffany. 
"Don't do it," said Gweneth. 
"I want to change," said Tanya. 
"Well, then," said Gweneth, "we will do whatever we have to do to help you 
with that." 
Dwayne walked down the hall to get dressed. "Where are the rest of you?" he 
asked. 
"We're in the kitchen," said Robin. 
Dwayne came down stairs and said, "There are three types of people in the 
world. Those who can't understand why we would want to help a strange woman 
we didn't know in spite of what her circumstances might be. The second group 
are those who think we're only doing it because we're good parents and 
deserve to be trusted." 
"The third group is everyone else," said Robin. 
"They come in a little bit later," said Dwayne. 
"That's us," said Tanya. 
"Come on in, gang," said Dwayne. 
Gweneth and Tiffany followed him and Robin back upstairs. 
"Gweneth," said Tanya, "you have a gun in the living room closet. I want to 
get it." 
"We have guns?" said Gweneth. 
"Yeah, I'm going to get mine out too," said Tanya. 
"Aren't you a little young to own a gun," said Gweneth. 
"Dwayne and Robin have the permits," said Tanya. 
"Gweneth, give me your gun," said Tanya. 
"Gweneth," said Robin. "I have a permit too." 
"Gweneth, give me the gun," said Tanya. 
"Dwayne, do you have a permit?" said Robin. 
"Yes," said Dwayne. 
"Tanya, give me your gun." 
"Dwayne, if you come over here and fight me, I'm going to use this gun." 
"If I come over here, you won't need that gun," said Dwayne. 
Dwayne and Robin were right. Gweneth couldn't stand the confrontation any 
longer and grabbed Tanya and the gun and pulled her outside. 
"Gweneth," she said, "I was joking." 
"Gweneth," said Tiffany, "we don't even know this girl." 
"That's no way to talk about someone's mother," said Gweneth. 
"Yeah, it is," said Tiffany. "Anyway, I'm going back to my friends." 
Tanya walked down the driveway. 
"They got a gun too," said Gweneth. 
"They're not very smart," said Robin. 
"Maybe they could be if they took up karate or something like that," said 
Gweneth. 
"I don't think it's that serious," said Robin. "Gweneth, why don't you give 
that gun to Dwayne so he can kill that girl." 
"My life is hard enough," said Gweneth. "I can't even have Dwayne kill anyone 
for me. She could easily kill us all if we take them back." 
"The more we hang around them, the worse it's going to be," said Robin. 
"You're right," said Gweneth. "We need to stick to our guns." 
Robin went to her room and slammed the door. 
Tanya went over to her dad's house to get the gun. 
"Good evening, Tanya," said her dad. "How is your mother?" 
"She's not doing good, I guess," said Tanya. "She and mom are always 
clashing." 
"You're not making friends?" asked her dad. 
"My mom's trying to make friends with her new husband. I don't think the 
whole situation is very good," said Tanya. "How are you doing?" 
"I have a new wife," said the man. "So I guess I am doing good. I don't think 
she likes it as much as I do</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:10
