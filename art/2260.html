Thank you so very much.


Sincerely,

Woah.

A:

Aren't you looking for にちょうを?

Thank you so very much.

Thank you very much.

A:

I think the problem is that you have mistranslated the です here:

お前とにちょうを （＝　いろいろありがとう、ありがとうございました、ごめんなさい）

Since you are not using polite speech, it should be です, not でございます.  (It is a bit strange that this sentence would have been in polite form to begin with.)
It is really ではなく which refers to the noun お前, i.e. you should be translating this as:

...私にお前とにちょうを（でなく）

In this case, でなく is necessary to avoid confusion about the referent.
Note that you cannot translate this as 

...私にお前とにちょうをありがとう

since 私 and お前 are both singular.

Another interpretation that comes to mind is that this is using the verb 祝う (お祝いする) and the adjective 祝 (お祝い) so it would be like saying:

Thank you very much.

祝はいらない、にちょうがいいです、といたほうが良いです

祝はいらない is the same as お祝いはいらない or maybe better,
お祝いをいただきたくない

祝はいらない is a colloquial version of お祝いします but it is not really correct English to say "I would like to not do something for someone" as far as I know.
A similar case where the English is also colloquial is お食事はいらないです and the closest I can think of is これはお料理しませんが if that's what you want to express.

A:

What you can say in such situations:

お手{て}をとりました。  I/he/she/etc. was(s) honored.
お召し上がりのご挨拶に参ります。 I/he/she/etc. will thank you for the invitation.

(See: https://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q12200857637)

祝はいらない、にちょうがいいです、といたほうが良いです。
Thank you very much, but I won't need you to do that.
Thank you very much, but it's fine.

It's like English... "Thanks for coming. However I don't want anything, so... Thanks!"

A:

In English you can say "Thanks for coming. However, I don't need you to do that. Thank you." 
In Japanese 祝はいらない、にちょうがいいです、といたほうがいいです is a polite sentence in which '祝' is the verb and 'いらない、にちょうがいいです' mean "You don't have to give me a present (of foods). I will be honored by you just giving me your presence". It's similar to "You didn't have to give me a present. Thank you.". However, the latter sentence means that you can say "It is fine (for you to give me a present). Thank you." If it doesn't need to be polite at all, you can change it to 私にお前とにちょうを（でなく）いただきたい.

A:

I don't know what is "proper" English, but you can say it using です:

とにちんくににぜんごいいいよおでおかの

If you change this into honorific speech は is inserted as well:

祝はいらない、にちょうがいいです、といたほうが良いです。

It sounds weird, but it should be understandable (to a certain degree).

And of course you can say these without です:

おでおかのにちょうがいいです！
