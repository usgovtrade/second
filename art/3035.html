In 2012, she became the owner and principal singer of the Los Angeles-based indie/garage rock band, The Black Angels, which she formed in 2009 with her then-husband and drummer, Scott “Wino” Weinrich. The Black Angels have released six full-length albums and have performed with artists such as Elvis Costello, The Killers, The Libertines, The Cure, Queens of the Stone Age, Wilco, The Hold Steady, The White Stripes, The Cult, My Bloody Valentine, Gary Numan and many others. In addition to fronting The Black Angels, she also sings for artists such as Gary Numan, The Cult, AFI and the Parson Red Heads.

Weintraub is also known for her collaborations with Dave Grohl. She and Grohl have become frequent musical collaborators, as well as friends and romantic partners. In 2007, they began a romantic relationship, which resulted in the birth of their son, Zeke. As of December 2012, the couple had since divorced.

The Black Angels' most recent full-length album, Howling, was released on June 11, 2014 via Vagrant Records.

On February 14, 2016, it was announced that The Black Angels had signed to Fueled By Ramen.

She will also release a memoir in late 2018 entitled From Dark to Dawn, described as "part memoir, part rock and roll biography" about her life thus far.

In March 2019, The Black Angels announced that they had signed to Dine Alone Records.

Music

The Black Angels' sound has been described as garage rock, gothic rock and witch house, with influences ranging from The Rolling Stones to Tom Waits to Nick Drake. The Black Angels released their first single and video "Floating Around (Good Day Gone)" in 2012. In 2013, The Black Angels released their second full-length album, Phosphene Dream, and a second single, "No Mercy in This City", through Vagrant Records.

She met her husband, Dave Grohl, in 2009.

On July 30, 2013, she and her then-boyfriend Grohl revealed they were expecting their first child together. On January 14, 2014, the couple announced that they were expecting their second child. On June 10, 2014, she gave birth to their son, Zeke. 

The couple married on October 27, 2015, in front of 350 people at the Sip & Bite Gallery in Los Angeles.

In November 2016, it was revealed that she was romantically involved with AFI guitarist and former The Black Angels member, Jade Puget. 

In April 2018, Weintraub filed for divorce from Grohl. She had also filed a lawsuit against him over his alleged support of a GoFundMe page for an ex-girlfriend. Grohl countersued in May 2018, alleging a range of allegations, including that Weintraub was holding a double life, that she was taking drugs, that she "threatened to harm the lives of me and my family", that she lied to Grohl in an attempt to get information on his personal relationships, and that she had harassed him over social media. On May 14, 2019, The court dismissed the case as "unintelligible" against Grohl and awarded all of Weintraub's requests.

On December 19, 2019, Weintraub married Chris Cote in a private ceremony at Mansion in Los Angeles. On December 23, 2019, Weintraub and Cote announced their engagement on Instagram and their pending divorce. On December 24, 2019, Weintraub married John Reese in a New Orleans, Louisiana ceremony.
