Instead 
of being a little bit, like,
 "Oh, I have a lot to learn," 
which I thought I did.
[LAUGHS]
It was the opposite. 
I felt like this
is a great opportunity 
to learn how not to be in the
world, how not to act 
in the world.
A lot of my ideas are 
very unrealistic.
If I had to go out and put them 
into practice,
it would just be horrible.
-Yeah, it might be fun. 
-I'm learning this, 
though, about 
the internet. I didn't think 
it was going to turn me
into a complete introvert.
There's a lot of people online 
who, like, talk about
their lives. [LAUGHS] 
But, still, it is fun.
I, like, don't talk much 
anymore. 
I think it's fine if I don't
talk for the next few days. 
Then, I'm going to turn that
off.
[PHONE RINGING]
How do you want me to 
deal with this?
-Hey, it's me.
Just want to let you know 
I love you,
and I want you to be happy.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
-Drew! Come on in. 
-Yes. 
-What are you doing here? 
-I brought pizza. 
I also brought pizza 
for your friends
at the apartment.
What are you doing here?
-This is me. 
I'm just gonna tell you,
I can't talk to you. 
-Why?
-Because my family's
in town.
-What's wrong with you 
sitting down
and talking to them?
-Because they're not around. 
They were in the city.
-Yeah. 
-They're not home. 
-They won't be home 
all the time.
-Maybe not, but they have a 
job.
They can go wherever they want.
-Have you been crying? 
-Uh-huh. 
-Did something happen? 
-They've got a meeting. 
They're coming back. 
-They won't be home? 
-They'll be back. 
You won't be able to see
them. 
-No, they will be back. 
-No, you won't see them.
-Wait. 
What are you gonna do? 
-I'm gonna tell them
that, hey, 
I was thinking about
what you said.
I told you that I was doing 
bad at school,
and I'm gonna work harder 
for my grades.
They know that 
I was upset,
but they didn't think 
you were gonna get mad
at me for saying something.
I told you that I love you,
and you never said 
you loved me back,
so I was wondering if I was
your top or if you were
my top.
What do you want me to say?
We're gonna talk later. 
[MUSIC PLAYING]
You know what I want?
[LAUGHS] 
I want you to go to college,
too.
I want to go back and 
have the conversation 
about going back to school.
-I wanna come back,
too.
-Let's go talk to your family. 
We'll come back.
-Wait. 
Are you gonna be okay 
by yourself? 
-I'm just gonna talk to them.
They won't be angry. 
-You know you can't go. 
I mean, you've got to be 
mature about it. 
-They are maturing. 
They'll be home. 
-They will? 
-The conversation went 
well.
They're sorry they didn't 
come back. 
They're trying to fix things. 
-I just want them to admit
they made mistakes. 
-I feel like I've talked 
to you on my phone.
Just talk to your family.
Let's just talk about 
everything. 
-Well, I think that's 
the point. 
You said you loved me.
You haven't said that to 
me. 
[MUSIC PLAYING] 
-This isn't great. 
-Good. 
-So, you and your friend 
are getting back together.
I thought it was something 
between me and you, 
but they said you guys are
getting back together.
-Nope. 
-They're friends, too? 
-Yeah, they're friends, 
too.
-That's why you guys are 
getting back together. 
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Drew: The last couple of 
weeks at the apartment 
have been very
difficult.
Every time I turn around,
the camera is in my face.
[CAMERA CLICKS] 
It's like a car alarm
on a car.
-There's a camera right here.
[CAMERA CLICKS] 
-I was out in front
of my building. 
It was 4:00 in the afternoon.
I got a camera in my face 
and the video went on Twitter
to Drew. 
It's on Twitter.
I'm always like, 
I'm going to the bathroom.
Then, my roommate 
was using the bathroom,
and she was like, 
"Don't make him laugh.
That's not funny."
Oh, my God. [LAUGHS] 
We don't have anything. 
We don't have any wine. 
We don't have anything. 
We don't have a wine rack.
When we're not at work,
we're eating food.
I need a wine rack.
Did you think about it? 
Do you want to see 
the video?
-No. 
-Yeah, sure.
-I'm not showing it to you.
-You don't want to see it?
-I think it's stupid. 
[LAUGHS]
-No. That would be like 
a bad experience.
You're just being so mean.
[LAUGHS]
Drew: I'm not being mean.
I wanted to show you the 
video.
I've been trying to be 
a good girl. 
I'm trying to be 
nice to everyone 
and not be a good friend 
anymore.
What's even better 
about the video
is the video went viral.
[LAUGHS] 
Drew doesn't know I saw it.
He was like, "I don't care. 
I don't care. 
I'm not trying to make 
anybody mad. 
I'm not trying to 
make anybody sad. 
I'm not trying to make 
anybody laugh.
I'm just trying to make 
myself laugh." 
Look at this. 
These videos got so many 
views,
and I actually have a phone.
You're kidding me. 
It's right there. 
-Yeah. 
[MUSIC PLAYING] 
[LAUGHS]
-There's videos of her
dancing on Twitter. 
[LAUGHS]
-Drew and your girlfriend
[LAUGHS] 
is a thing. 
[LAUGHS]
-Did you watch the video?
-I watched a video of 
you dancing. 
-Oh, my God. 
No, I'm not dancing.
I'm standing in front 
of a camera. 
It's my roommate who's the 
dancer.
-No, it's you.
-No. 
-She can't dance. 
She's wearing heels. 
She's just standing there.
She has no idea 
what she's doing. 
She's just dancing 
'cause you told her to.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[CLAPPING]
[APPLAUSE] 
[LAUGHS]
That's good.
Let's do it again.
Let's do it again.
Let's do it again.
[LAUGHING]
-When she started dancing,
I knew it was me.
I wasn't sure.
I was like, "Is it you?"
That was one of the things
that I was scared of,
was somebody coming up
to me and being like,
 "I knew it was you."
-You thought I was actually
going to go up to you and
be like, "I knew it was you."
It's like, "No. 
I really think that she did.
I think she went</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:30
