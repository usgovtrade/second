That’s a clue,’” said Rinat Farkas, a software engineer. “I think it’s a sign. Maybe the show should end with that.”

When the episode ends and a woman in the credits says, “This week in The Great British Bake Off, it all came down to a simple cream buns,” Bex Bailey wrote on Twitter, “Oh. OH. OH. My. God. Did you not see season 6?”

It’s unclear if the last-minute twist was an elaborate, years-in-the-making plan or if a producer just woke up one day and said “What if we do this?” But the ending, though completely unearned, seems to have worked, both with fans and critics. The Guardian wrote in its review, “It has to be said: it’s actually pretty brilliant. After all that build-up, the audience had come to expect the worst. Instead they got a sweet ending.”

The Daily Beast was slightly less impressed. “It seems like a cruel joke at first, one that threatens to ruin the end of a show that could have been the best in years,” they wrote. “And the ending did not live up to the promise it promised. Still, I suspect that the best part of the ending was when Aisling suddenly started laughing and could not stop. There’s something that brings more joy than the actual ending of the episode.”

The episode was written by Richard Osman and was directed by Michael Cumming. The winner will be revealed on Wednesday, June 19.
