It's like a movie with all the wrong pieces, yet I can't stop watching it. It's like a movie with all the wrong pieces, yet I can't stop watching it."

A lot of new info has been discovered in the past week. The cast list has been released, and there are two new players.

- There will be two new bosses in the game, one of them is from Capcom's own Umbrella series.

- One is a Umbrella veteran turned into an zombie. That said, it's hard to make out.

- Another zombie boss is a character from a famous video game franchise, you may recognize this enemy if you played "Resident Evil 4".

- The zombies are also from the Umbrella series.

- A third boss is a monster called Lickers.

- A new enemy is revealed - a small, cute, pink creature called an Ammo Box. Ammo is a common term for bullets.

- One of the new characters is someone I mentioned before. Someone famous that is now a zombie. A friend of mine said "Zombie Resident Evil 5!"

- The game will feature three playable characters. The only one who isn't confirmed so far is Albert Wesker. One person said he will be in the game, but don't quote me on this.

- The story involves the "Resident Evil" series. That said, there will be new zombies in the game, not the traditional ones. Also, one of the villains is the villain from "Resident Evil 2".

- There are some familiar elements in the game, like tanks, but also new stuff like a gas mask.

- One of the character models will be a woman wearing a red swimsuit.

- The setting is in a mansion with a mansion in the background. It also contains statues, including some that look like women. I'm sure you've seen it.

- This is a new installment of Resident Evil. I'm sorry if this wasn't as entertaining to read as it was for me, but I tried to add in new info where I could.

Driftking: Well, there will be many different zombies. From Umbrella's and the Resident Evil's universe.

Punky: Yeeeh..

Driftking: Yeeeeeeeah...

(I had to help him out. ^_^)

Driftking: Yeeeeeeah... I don't know who else there is to talk about.

Punky: (Lol) Well, I had to add some zombies I thought were there. Like zombies from Umbrella and Resident Evil 4.

Punky: Anyway, the release date is set at June 1st, 2019. The release will follow that of "Resident Evil 7: Biohazard". It will be released on the PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The PlayStation version is listed as a "Rebirth" version, meaning that it will use "Resident Evil 5" as a base.

Driftking: I don't think this is true, but I don't see a Umbrella logo and a Resident Evil 5 logo.

Driftking: I do think this is true, but I don't see a Umbrella logo and a Resident Evil 5 logo.

(He got a PSN code for REmake 2)

Driftking: I can see a Umbrella logo and a Resident Evil 5 logo.

Punky: (Lol) I've never had a PSN code for REmake 2... I can't get that game on PSN, so this code has already been used.

Driftking: I'll get the code. I just got an email from Nintendo, but it was something I never thought about. I really should get it for my nephews. They love RE.

Punky: (Lol) This isn't RE7 though. It's supposed to be RE5, or maybe RE 5 remake, I'm not sure which. In any case, it's just the remake of Resident Evil 5.

Driftking: Oh... well, anyway. I'm going to go away and research "Resident Evil 5", although I probably won't tell any useful info. I'll be back tomorrow, probably.

(He goes off to his room to look for the info, and then returns.)

Driftking: Ok, so I was researching "Resident Evil 5" on Youtube, and I found this. "The Last of Us" director and film artist, Naughty Dog, confirmed that Umbrella makes the S.T.A.R.S. units in "Resident Evil 5", so it's obviously a reference to the famous stealth game "S.T.A.R.S". In any case, the stealth-based gameplay from "Resident Evil 5" was probably inspired by "The Last of Us", as it has much in common. Also, here's a quick look at "Resident Evil 5" that is similar to "Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition"

(He shows some clips from "Resident Evil 5".)

Driftking: The first scene on the left features one of the S.T.A.R.S. units. The character in the armor is the original main character from "Resident Evil". In other words, the S.T.A.R.S. units were the people wearing the suits, and the character on the right is a former S.T.A.R.S. unit.

Driftking: He was one of the original members of S.T.A.R.S., a former S.T.A.R.S. unit, and he's from Raccoon City as well. That said, he died in the beginning of the first game, and turned into a zombie like you've seen before.

Driftking: The second scene is a part of the first mission, where the player has to go to Raccoon City and rescue S.T.A.R.S. He goes back and forth between being a zombie and a living person, while shooting zombies.

Driftking: So, there's a small bit of backstory here. Raccoon City had a riot at the time. Also, at the beginning of "Resident Evil 4", Raccoon City was attacked by the Los Illuminados, so this is more like the final part of the Raccoon City story from "Resident Evil 4".

Punky: It's interesting that he has a "Resident Evil" hat, with the red cross.

Driftking: Yeah. I agree. And don't forget the black gloves.

Punky: I want to know if there are any characters with their names being blacked out. For example, Jill Valentine and Ada Wong.

Driftking: I don't think so. There is a character who is a cop in this game though.

Punky: One of the characters is also in the "Resident Evil" series, someone who makes you scared, but at the same time he's also a comical character.

Driftking: Well, there's a person called Leon in this game.

Punky: Really? How does he look? Is he a little child?

Driftking: (Smiles) He looks like a small, chubby boy. He wears a white outfit like what Leon from "Resident Evil" wore, and he looks like a little child.

Driftking: In fact, this is a kid who was in the original game. His name is Alexia, and she's from the original game. So it's sort of like her playing Resident Evil 5 with other players.

Punky: "Alexia" is very similar to Ada Wong, right? Also, there is this character called Chris Redfield. He is a Umbrella veteran, a former S.T.A.R.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:22
