See the attached spreadsheet.  The counterparty name in RED should be changed 
in Sitara to reflect the correct counterparty name.  This also impacts deals 
which need to be moved to the new logistics system.  I am leaving it to you 
guys to figure out the logistics.

So let me know if you have any problems.
