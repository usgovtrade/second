concerned about the impact your actions have on others." 
I'll make a suggestion if you can't guess from the two. 
Try making a good-faith effort to learn from your mistakes. 
And, if you don't want to learn, then at least try not to 
make any more mistakes. 

I've spoken to friends and relatives of the victim and 
they wish to convey their heartfelt sympathy to the Foleys. 
Toward that end, I gave permission to the Sacramento Bee to 
publish a few family comments. 

Bob Foley, mother: "I have never before been more proud 
of him." 

Ann Foley, wife: "We are saddened by this, but will be 
consoled knowing that some good may come from it." 
"He worked so hard to try and make a better world for 
people," she said. 
"We will be thinking of all the things we could have done 
differently," she said. "If I could turn back the hands 
of time, I would have been a better person." 

George Foley, father: "A wonderful boy was taken too soon. 
I loved my son and will never have the opportunity to meet 
him as an adult. 
"He is and always will be the source of my strength and 
inspiration." 

Mary Ann Foley, daughter: "A light has been turned off in my 
life. 
"My dad was my best friend. When people came over, it was 
his house. 
"I will never be the same." 

If you would like to pass along your condolences, the 
family's address is: the Foleys, 1105 S. McClellan Blvd., 
Phoenix, AZ 85086. 
I think this e-mail is better than a letter, because it has 
the tone and content of a personal, handwritten note. 

Please let me know if you have questions. 

Sincerely, 
Kristi
