create custom fonts at a low cost.  It requires a visit to the Post Office to 
meet with a graphics specialist and sign an agreement.  This allows you a 
limited license to the Post Script font for use in the production of the new 
product.  This means that the cost of creating a new original character is 
$9.00 plus art, which is much less expensive than an original character in a 
font from a traditional foundry.  

Here's the cost of our new, custom, hand drawn, original 'Monkeys' (in caps 
with arial body, italic and hand selected shadows and other effects -- total 
art work less than 1 day on an Apple ][e with a dot matrix printer) for 
example:

Art cost:                                                            $100.00
Graphic Specialist:  1 day @ $50/hour                                $   50.00
Postage:                                                             $   3.00
Hand-drawing costs:                                                  $  10.00
Total cost:                                                          $113.00 

This is $0.06 per copy of the final product for artwork.  If I did a 300 
characters per font version it would cost just $1.80 to produce.  The 
traditional method would cost between $300.00 and $800.00 to create the 
same characters, depending on complexity and amount of hand drawing involved.

We'll be making the fonts available in three versions, Regular, Bold and 
Hand Lettered with shadow versions of all three.  If you are interested in 
investigating this process further please email me at 
david.munoz@superaerohq.com and I will send you some of the fonts and 
information that I used to develop them.

As usual, all of our fonts are OpenType Unicode, which will make them 
widely compatible with MS Office.

What's cool here is that this is not a service for those who already know 
how to design or hand draw characters, but it's for anyone who has an idea 
they'd like to see come to fruition with a neat font to match. 
You can get the results of our development as soon as you have an idea!
