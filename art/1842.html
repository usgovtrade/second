I'm sure you remember the movie A Bug's Life, where we are introduced to a friendly ball of goo called Heimlich who only wants to be friends with the ants. Now scientists from the University of Bristol have discovered why these creatures are so popular amongst insects.

It turns out that certain species of "killer bee" feed on the goo balls, which is a nutritious food for them. The bees would have to get stung multiple times in order to actually eat their victim, so for most of the time, the goo balls live happily among their friends.

This new finding does not mean bees will start enjoying Heimlich's goo balls, but it does explain why they like to have them around.
