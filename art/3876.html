Testo This Is the Man

This Is the man, yes you see

Everything you've been told about me is true

Just remember you heard it here first, see

This Is The Man

Everything you've been told about me is true

I used to walk around in black and white, now I walk around in all my colours, in the right time

Just remember you heard it here first, see

This Is The Man

Everything you've been told about me is true

Everybody's coming to the house, they see the lights are on

But you better recognize, this Is the man, yes you see

This Is The Man

Everything you've been told about me is true

I'm in love with my guitar, it makes me sing out loud, and I know you're gonna like this song

Just remember you heard it here first, see

This Is The Man

Everything you've been told about me is true

I've got a different sound for a different age, I guess you know that I'm still true

You've got to remember you heard it here first, see

This Is The Man

Everything you've been told about me is true

I was watching for you, I think I saw you, I didn't want you to forget me

Cause you can tell all your friends, that you knew me, back in school

Just remember you heard it here first, see

This Is The Man

Everything you've been told about me is true

Everything you've been told about me is true

Everything you've been told about me is true

Just remember you heard it here first, see

This Is The Man

Everything you've been told about me is true

Everything you've been told about me is true

Everything you've been told about me is true

This Is The Man

Everything you've been told about me is true

Everything you've been told about me is true

Everything you've been told about me is true
