If you want to have some fun during your stay, you can visit the casinos and see what is available or if you have to stay and keep busy, you can visit the many lounges and bars. There are bars for each of the crew types and then one for the player to go to if they are in a crew. You will need to find them all. The different bars are for each of the types of Crew you can join: Pimp, Hustler, Gopher, Gambler, Playboy, and even one for the players.

I should have made this a single post because I could not find a way to separate this post from my other posts. If you are interested, check out my review for PlanetSide Universe on MyT-Rex

You can now pre-order and pre-download PlanetSide 2 before the full release on September 10th! I will be playing this as soon as it comes out.

Thanks for reading. Have a great night.

Is there any chance to run PS2 on Windows 7 and maybe 7 64 bit?
It would be nice if there is option to choose system language. And change the color theme and background image.

Sergio Rocha BelloPosted on 2013-02-16

It doesn’t support Windows 7. I really want them to include a language change feature to it, because not many people in the world speak English.

Sergio Rocha BelloPosted on 2013-02-16

On my Windows 7 system. Not a single language worked for me. And the game had no graphics. It crashed. If you want to play PS2 on Windows 7, you will have to use XP.

I would very much like to get it on my Windows Vista computer. I tried it on XP first but with no success.

You can try to connect to the servers for PS2 but no matter if it says it’s online or not, you will not be able to play it unless you purchase the game. At least until PS2 gets a free-to-play model like other games. Maybe the full retail version will allow people to play for free. At least on PC we don’t have to buy the game to play it.

So I guess PS2 is going to get a free to play model after all, even if you want to be able to play on a non-Steam version.

I wonder if PlanetSide 2 will allow players to transfer their characters and progression to a free account version?

Morgana AlmeidaPosted on 2013-02-10

As far as I know PS2 will have a free-to-play mode but only after this one. So don’t expect to be able to play it for free in the future. Not only that but not many people that are playing it now might pay for it.

Morgana AlmeidaPosted on 2013-02-10

You will only need to pay for one or two of these servers that are needed to play PlanetSide 2 online. If you want a full server, you can buy the full version but you don</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:55
