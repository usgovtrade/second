The CEBP Program was first funded in 1980 and provides a unique interdisciplinary didactic training program with the aim of producing independent researchers who can work effectively with clinicians, epidemiologists, and other scientists, and contribute to the advancement of cancer epidemiology. The predoctoral training program includes options in the following areas: 1) epidemiology;2) biostatistics;3) environmental/occupational/social epidemiology;4) biology of cancer;and 5) cancer control. For postdoctoral training, candidates must submit an application before acceptance into the program. Training is provided by a faculty of 30 senior scientists from both basic and applied disciplines in the Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Cancer Prevention. Research interests of the faculty span the full spectrum of cancer epidemiology from fundamental molecular biology to clinical trials, including topics in cancer etiology, cancer screening and diagnosis, gene-environment interactions, tobacco and cancer, prevention of cancer and its treatment, second primary cancers, and issues of survivorship. Trainees are selected from a pool of candidates who have successfully completed their doctoral degree. The selection process is highly competitive and both domestic and international candidates are sought. Two-thirds of the predoctoral trainees are enrolled in the three interrelated doctoral programs (Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Cancer Prevention) offered by the Department of Epidemiology. Trainees with a doctoral degree are admitted to these programs after first spending at least two years in a non-degree research track. The remaining one-third of the predoctoral trainees are admitted directly into the CEBP training program, through a separate application process. Trainees are appointed after completing an initial intensive training period of at least two years and must satisfy at least two out of three requirements for continued appointment (maintaining a GPA of 3.3 or better and passing written and oral qualifying exams). The training grant is the central mechanism for providing CEBP support for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, allowing optimal flexibility for developing and refining the program. It also provides vital start-up funds and other support for the development of new course offerings, as well as critical seed funds for faculty recruitment. This funding also supports the development of new courses in other research disciplines, bringing together scholars from multiple disciplines to increase their exposure to, and appreciation for, the goals of the CEBP training program and to produce the next generation of researchers working on cancer prevention and control.
