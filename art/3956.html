The song reflects the conflict that many young women and men have in choosing to believe in Jesus Christ's atonement and the promises of His redemption.

The original version of the song, penned by Stubbs and recorded in 1989, was released as a single in Australia by CBS Records. It placed at number seven on the ARIA Charts. The song was a commercial success in Europe, also charting in Austria, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. In 1991, it was re-recorded by Australian artist Deborah Conway and released as the second single from her third studio album, Secret Heart (1991). Conway's version peaked within the top-ten on the ARIA Charts, reaching number six, and was certified gold by ARIA for selling over 35,000 copies. Conway's version was released in the United Kingdom in 1992 by Chrysalis Records, and again charted in the top-ten, peaking at number seven.

In 1993 Conway recorded another version of the song with English girl group Bananarama, which was produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. Her version of "The Winds of Heaven" was released on her first greatest hits album The Best of Deborah Conway and debuted and peaked at number two on the ARIA Charts, becoming her highest charting solo single. It also became the group's highest charting single. In the UK, Conway's version reached number-one on the UK Singles Chart. In September 1996, it was re-recorded by The Beautiful South, the band being the group of musicians who had toured with Conway during the release of The Best of Deborah Conway album in 1993. The Beautiful South version was released as a single on 28 September 1996. The group re-recorded the song on their 1996 album, Songs from the Beautiful South, and also featured in the accompanying music video.

In 1998, Conway's version was released as a bonus track on Conway's album The Very Best of Deborah Conway, the tracks being newly remixed by producer Tore Johansson. In 2002 Conway re-recorded the song with all-female trio 3rd Impact for their second studio album, Life In-Between (2002). Their version, released as a single by BMG Australia in June 2002, peaked at number nine on the ARIA Charts. It received a platinum certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for selling 70,000 copies. In 2009 Conway also recorded a version of the song with Australian Children's music group The Cat Empire. The group released their version as a single to promote the release of their fourth album, Two Shoes. It was the first single released by the group that had not been produced by Paul McKercher, with most of the album's tracks having been produced by Conway, Tilbrook and John Castle.
