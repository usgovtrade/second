Her guides used music to bring her on a deep journey through various dimensions of consciousness. As she began the meditation she received instructions to visualize a rainbow appearing behind her and around her in the meditation room. After the visualization she felt taken on a ride through various other dimensions that included a beautiful, angelic beach, a castle, a light-filled library and a realm of healing.

Use this meditation to gain access to other dimensions and visit them in your meditations. You may choose to re-listen to the meditation to return back into the other dimensions.

You can choose to use the following music in this meditation:

Music by Piotr Górniak. Piotr is a DJ/Producer in Poland and Russia who loves to mix his music to relax and heal. His music will take you into another dimension, a dreamy dimension with a touch of darkness.

The following tracks are available on: https://soundcloud.com/piotr-gorniak/sets/journey-through-reality-with-music

Use this music to visit the various realms while listening to the following podcast:http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=2acf24cc50cce8bf9e3e33a6ac0ceb3d

Use the below meditation to begin or continue your journey to awaken your Heart Path.

“Open your heart, open your mind and open your third eye. With this breath, focus on the place that feels like a small child's heart, the place where it feels like we were all born. You can find that on the chest and right between the breasts and you are to breathe into that. And as you are doing this you are to imagine that in the heart there are these sparkling lights of light, these little golden shimmers of light, and there is this child opening the lid of the sky, and she does not know yet that this is the way that we are made, this is the way that we are connected. If she looks at us with eyes of love, she will learn what it is that we have, that we are made from. And when she feels the love within us, that begins to shine back to her from within. So as you breathe into this, breathe your love into this connection that we have to each other.”

You are to imagine that you are inside the body, lying down and breathing. Imagine the breath spreading out through the top of your head, coming out through your crown chakra. You are now breathing in through your hands and spreading that breath out through the whole body, from the top of your head and then out to the soles of your feet. This breath is to flow around you in a circular motion and then you are to allow the breath to come in through your nose and spread it out with your lips. You are to open your mouth and allow the breath to come in and fill the bottom part of your mouth and flow out through your nose, and then begin again with the breath coming out through the nose. Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth for five to seven minutes. You can either start very slow and you can notice that each time you breathe in, the breath can fill you more and more. You are to enjoy yourself as you breathe in and out. Feel your breath move in your body and feel your abdomen move.

This is a beautiful music to listen to when doing any energy healing and spiritual work, or just to get in a meditative state with, or perhaps as background music while reading. It is a great music for dreaming.

This music can help with spiritual work and meditation, especially opening the Heart and Crown chakras, and connecting with your higher self or inner guides, spirit guides, ascended masters or ascended masters.

Use this music as background music while doing many different tasks or while meditating.

A beautiful female voice singing with her guitar a relaxing melody on a background of nature sounds. Meditation music with a touch of sadness.

I do not own the music in any way, I am providing you a link to it and with it a free subscription for a month. If you like the music, please buy the song on iTunes and help this woman to continue her work and the good work she is doing. The link to the website is:

This is an excellent place to purchase music if you like this music. The song was one of the reasons that I created my Eternal Mother Audio Meditations. So that I could go back to this track. To remind me and remind others what I learned, to remember where I came from and why we are here.

Music with great beauty, which is perfect for meditation, as it awakens your higher self or higher dimensional self. It is a long meditation, with many changes. This music is the first part of the meditation which lasts around 10 minutes. It is also the music for the meditation that opens your Heart Chakra. http://www.reverbnation.com/anonymous/album/606545-illuminating-your-heart-chakra-meditations
