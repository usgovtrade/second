flesh, with their stores, eaten by the natives, who lived there: hence,
by the way, a name is given to this desert, namely _gannet_, which signifies
sea-dog or sea-monster.

[FN#60] i.e. "Souls which have passed away before the Judgment-Day, and
therefore are secure from the Day of Resurrection and from Hell."

[FN#61] Lane here remarks that in the English text the words are written
"Kulth-i-Hijjah," evidently a mistake of the author.

[FN#62] In this passage it may be noticed that the idea of the "souls of
the righteous" being in Hell is also found in the Koran, Surah xviii. 56.

[FN#63] In the translation of Ibn Khallikan we read "He (Shams al-Daula)
had a daughter who was called the "Luckless" because she was unhappy."

[FN#64] A celebrated Persian poet who flourished about the year 838 (A.D.
230).

[FN#65] In the translation of Ibn Khallikan we read "They (the old men)
gave advice to their young men to make an end of their lives by the
falling sickness or by drowning themselves, or they recommended them to
the practice of continence or to the recitation of Koran, or they
commanded them to leave off eating flesh."

[FN#66] In the translation of Ibn Khallikan we read, "It is a rule
observed by the Arabs that if a man is invited to enter a caravan, he
should either refuse or enter it. As, however, Shaykh Ibrahim said in the
present instance, it was a rule of the Prophet himself (upon whom be the
mercy of God) that when he was not mounted he should ride on a donkey
between two camels (saying), 'I am on my brother, the camel' The Prophet
(upon whom be the mercy of God!) said, 'The beast of God is the donkey'
and 'The beast of the people is the horse' " The reason for this custom is
noted by Lane (ii. 463).

[FN#67] An allusion to the story of the three Calenders and the Jew, the
circumstances of which are given by some Arabic writers.

[FN#68] In the translation of Ibn Khallikan we read "He went and sat on
the ground and, drawing out a little book written with his own hand, he
remained in that attitude till evening. Some said that the Prophet had
recited Sura xxviii. (which commands the Moslems to recite verses) and so
he had sat on the ground." In the same tale (i. 670) we have a reference to
one Yahya who said that, when the Prophet's beard was long, he used to
remain a whole day motionless at prayer. It may be noticed that the author
quotes, not from memory, but from a copy of the Koran.

[FN#69] These Moslem women are said to carry a peculiar fan and to sing
songs of the Prophet to it as they walk along. (Easterns.)

[FN#70] In the translation of Ibn Khallikan we read "He (i.e. the
Imam) pronounced over him an 'Apostle's curse', and the young men, by
dint of beating him, extorted from him a promise to give up his evil ways,
and he agreed to the fulfilment of our condition, namely, to become a
companion of the house of Ja'afar. And there is on record a tradition,
that Ja'afar had him fetched from the cemetery (outside the Mosque)
(where he had gone to bury his head) and took him to his house, and
suffered him to live with him in the place of the young man mentioned
above." Lane (ii. 466) says that "Al-Muhassin became the 'Companion' of
Ja'afar, and that he was afterwards called 'the Companion of God's
Cousin'." He had, it seems, been an old companion of Ja'afar, and is
mentioned in the tales; he was called Al-Muhassin, "the Pious" (i.e. a
"fakir"), and was from Irak, near Bagdad, "a bald-headed, gray-bearded old
man, who had committed thefts and was very devout" (Lane, vol. ii. 466).
"He came to Ja'afar's house, was treated hospitably, and found,
apparently, his friends, who urged him to remain and not leave the
Moslem." It is added, "When Ja'afar's friends told him that al-Muhassin
had become his companion, he exclaimed, 'And he is now the companion of my
cousin (i.e. cousin-in-law)! Why did he wish to become my companion?' And
it is said that he never after admitted the man to his house."

[FN#71] In the translation of Ibn Khallikan we read "It is a standing
rule with us that the husband may forbid his wife to visit her mother,
for, were it not for this, it would be said that we do not look on mothers
as lawful; but the mother-in-law (i.e. sister) is a lawful person."

[FN#72] In the translation of Ibn Khallikan we read "As soon as he reached
the town, he entered a mosque where Ja'afar was, and said to the
bystanders, 'Take hold of this man.' He was accordingly delivered over to
the officers, and Ja'afar said, 'I do not require this man,' for they
would have put him to death. So he remained there that day, and on the
following morning he was set at liberty and was invited to rejoin his
friends, but he declined to do so and gave up all hopes of marrying his
daughter. And it was said that he was a poor man and that he had no money;
how then did he marry the lady?" Lane (vol. ii. 467) gives a more
probable version of this adventure which, he says, the Moslem writers have
changed. He adds that the bridegroom remained for three days in the
Mosque, and during that time gave a thousand dirhems and then gave up all
hope of marriage. Al-Mas'udi (chapt. xxiv. pt. 1) says, "Abu Ja'afar al-
Muhassin ibn Abu al-Jarud, after he had been brought to his house, said, 'I
have been brought here, and this is a fine place, but my heart is broken
by what has happened to me.' He was, therefore, unable to sleep, but lay
waking till morning, when Ja'afar said to his wife, 'Look! I had but one
daughter, and this man has brought a second. Tell your father to come to
me.' So she went to her father and said, 'The Commander of the Faithful,
Ja'afar, sends you his salutations, and says, Come to him that your
daughter may marry.' 'The girl has given me up,' said the old man, and
would not go till he had eaten a morsel and taken a cup of wine. Then he
went, and his daughter was brought to him, and he embraced her and bade
her farewell. Then he rose and came back to Ja'afar's house, and spent
several nights with him. On the third night Ja'afar said to him, 'Why do
you not take the girl and give her to the matchmaker, for she is a
valuable girl?' 'O my lord,' he answered, 'if she were as valuable as her
price is, she would be worth twenty thousand dirhems, and I have not the
wherewithal to buy such a piece of property; but I had a black ewe that
was with young, and the thieves broke in and stole it from me.' Now
Ja'afar had a son called Abd al-Hamid, who was a very ill-looking man, and
who had lost the only remaining eye of the right eye of his youth. The old
man begged to kiss this eye, which Ja'afar gave him permission to do. The
young man then sent for two black slaves, and when they came, he gave them
each a thousand dirhems, and made over to them the young ewe, saying, 'Take
your ewe and let it graze.' So they departed and left the old man sitting
by Ja'afar's side. He then asked the latter, 'O my lord, do you require
anything?' 'Yes,' replied Ja'afar, 'a thousand dirhems.' So he gave it him</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:07
