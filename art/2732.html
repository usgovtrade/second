This module is capable of handling the redirection to the specified
destination. The redirection can be to any URL.

This module can be used to perform
the following functions:

-   It can be used to track the HTTP redirections to multiple
    destinations by logging information about the host, its
    request, and the destination host.
-   It can be used to track which URLs are redirected by sending the
    request to the destination.

The following actions can be configured using this module.

-   **Sends Redirection Request To The URL**. This action allows the
    user to send the redirection request to the destination URL. This
    parameter takes a value from 1 to 150 (which is the maximum). This
    action is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection
    Module in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To A List Of URLs**. This action allows
    the user to send the redirection request to multiple URLs. The
    destination for each redirection can be given as a list of 1 to 5
    URLs. This action is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP
    Redirection Module in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To A List Of Sources**. This action
    allows the user to specify a URL list of either the source or the
    destination. If the sources are the destination, the list of URLs
    will be processed by the redirection module and the redirection
    request will be sent to the same. If the destination and the source
    are specified, the redirection will happen only to the destination
    and will not happen on the source. This action is **Not
    Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To A List Of Destinations**. This
    action allows the user to specify a URL list of either the source
    or the destination. If the sources are the destination, the list of
    URLs will be processed by the redirection module and the redirection
    request will be sent to the same. If the destination and the source
    are specified, the redirection will happen only to the destination
    and will not happen on the source. This action is **Not
    Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To A Single Destination**. This action
    allows the user to specify one destination URL. The redirection
    request will be sent to the destination if it is found. This action
    is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module in
    place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To A Single Source**. This action allows
    the user to specify one source URL. The redirection request will be
    sent to the source if it is found. This action is **Not Applicable**
    when there is a HTTP Redirection Module in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To Multiple Sources**. This action
    allows the user to specify multiple source URLs. The redirection
    request will be sent to all the sources if they are found. This
    action is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module
    in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To Multiple Destinations**. This action
    allows the user to specify multiple destination URLs. The redirection
    request will be sent to all the destinations if they are found. This
    action is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module
    in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To Multiple Sources Based On Sources**.
    This action allows the user to specify a list of source URLs that
    are redirected based on the source. The redirection request will be
    sent to the sources if they are found. This action is **Not
    Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To Multiple Destinations Based On
    Destinations**. This action allows the user to specify a list of
    destination URLs that are redirected based on the destination. The
    redirection request will be sent to the destination if they are
    found. This action is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP
    Redirection Module in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To Multiple Sources Based On Destinations**.
    This action allows the user to specify a list of source URLs that
    are redirected based on the destination. The redirection request
    will be sent to the destinations if they are found. This action is
    **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module in place.
-   **Sends Redirection Request To Multiple Sources And Destinations**.
    This action allows the user to specify a list of sources and
    destinations that will be redirected based on the source and
    destination. This action is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP
    Redirection Module in place.
-   **Stops Redirection Request When It Reaches The Destination**. This
    action allows the user to stop the redirection when the destination
    is reached. This action is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP
    Redirection Module in place.
-   **Starts Redirection Request At The Source**. This action allows the
    user to start the redirection request from the source. This action
    is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module in
    place.
-   **Stores Information For X Amount Of Time**. This action allows the
    user to store information for the specified time. This action is
    **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module in place.
-   **Stores Information For All The Time**. This action allows the user
    to store information for the duration of the transaction. This
    action is **Not Applicable** when there is a HTTP Redirection Module
    in place.

Redirections can be logged in the message file, either to separate or
the same log.


<!-- Steps -->

1.  Add the URL of the application for which the HTTP Redirection Module
    should work in the list of redirecting URLs,

    **\*.aspx**,

    for example, if you need to redirect all ASPX pages, you can add

    `\\CIServer\redirect.aspx`

2.  The next step is to set the Destination. In this example, the URL of
    the destination is the URL of the HTTP Redirection Module which
    will be located on the destination system.

    **C:\CIServer\HttpRedirect\WebRequestFilter.dll**


<!-- Sample Usage -->

Sample URL that triggers redirection to an internal webpage on the same
machine.

    http://www.example.com/sample.aspx?redir=C:\CIServer\HttpRedirect\WebRequestFilter.dll?source=*Source*

The sample will be redirected to the same machine on

    http://www.example.com/sample.aspx?redir=C:\CIServer\HttpRedirect\WebRequestFilter.dll?destination=http://<destination IP>


<!-- Remarks -->

A redirection request is sent to the destination if the destination is
found. It is not sent to the URL if it is the source, or if the
destination is the source. It is also not sent to the URLs if the
source is the destination or if the destination is the source.

This module cannot be used to redirect to URLs on the same machine
because it sends the redirection request to the destination.

> **Note**  The HTTP Redirection module and this module do not work
> together. It is not possible to specify that a redirection should be
> done to a specific destination and a specific source, at the same
> time. This module can only be used with HTTP Redirection modules
> which have this functionality.
