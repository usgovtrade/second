It was produced by Chris Lassiter of FUCT, and the lyrics were written by Chris from FUCT, along with Chris from Superstition.
The music video's director was Scott Lasky. It was filmed in the heart of a New Orleans alley.
I'll Show You How Threatening I Am was the first song released from this album, with Chris performing it on "Live @ FUCT".
Other songs featured on "You'll Never Get Away" are Bam's "It's Not You, It's Me", produced by The Dreaming Tree;
and Caleb James & Jay Lumen's "Get Ready", produced by Lumen.
On "You'll Never Get Away" we find that there is no way to go "back in time."
I'll Show You How Threatening I Am will be released on 6/15/10.

The song was remade in 2011 by the band as their "Unleash the Bear" album. A song with the same name and lyrics can be found on the band's new album "Tribute to a King" released in 2016.
