The most popular posts are probably the ones that show the most creative ideas and that you, the reader, can try out with your kids. I think that it is your best option to try and write a post with content you are personally interested in, then promote it well. If it doesn't go too well you can take it as valuable experience for your next post, but the best case is that you can share some interesting things with your friends on the blog. 
The goal of the site is to help you to expand your personal network with people of similar interests. I don't think there is an optimal solution for having a successful site in the long term. 

A:

My best strategy:

Find content that is unique. I know it's hard to think of content, but there are things unique to each person - that's what makes us individuals. A lot of people can tell you how to do something, but when you look at what you are doing, you will see that no one else is doing it the way you do. I recommend writing in your journal, even if it's only a few words. It is easy to keep up a blog once you have the habit, but it is hard to start it up without.
Tell your story. Tell a short story about yourself (or maybe about someone you love), and explain how something funny happened (or just let it roll off your mind if you think the humor will come). Keep it short and sweet (ie. it should be in the paragraph). You want your site to be about you, not about somebody else's story. This is why people will come back again and again. When they see a new entry, they'll want to see what you have been up to since the last time. 
Keep it up. The site gets boring for some people if there isn't new content after a while. Make sure you have a steady flow of new entries coming. Some people don't get as much as they want and feel bad about themselves, which is why people lose motivation. Be honest with your feelings if you don't get many comments, but be sure to do your best.
Promote yourself. As I said, there are people out there that will be inspired by what you have to say. In fact, if they aren't inspired by your entry and see your comments, it will hurt them. This is what drives them to keep visiting your page. There are many ways you can promote yourself: 

Link to your site in your profile (if you don't already have one)
Link to it in your posts
Put an ad for your site in your signature
Put links to your site in your signature
Make your content public. If it is meant for a niche, most people won't understand it. Most people won't be inspired by it if they have no connection to it. 

It is a gamble that you will have many people visit your site. Some people can get thousands of followers, and others may get none. Don't get disappointed, though. You will make connections and learn something out of it.

We started one a while back - we're not doing very well on it, but we did have to re-write our definition of family.
Our goal is for the blog to grow into a resource for folks who want to keep up with us. And to be a little silly. 
A few things we're doing that seem to be working for us:

The blog is only 2 years old. We don't try to maintain it much, but it's easy to forget about it.
In order to be sure we don't lose visitors, we make it a rule to be online at least once a week. When our kids were young, I didn't get a lot of writing done when I had the house to myself, but if we're home, I just know it's going to happen.
We post one (or more) thing a week. Just once a week, we'll post our weekly family date, our grocery list, or our family schedule - things that will be useful to our friends.
We link to our blog in our Twitter/Facebook accounts. (Don't do it in a way that sounds spammy.) 
We make a point of tweeting and Facebooking as often as we can, and we talk about what's going on in the blog.

But the main thing - not everybody who follows you online is going to be your friend. Sometimes people follow you because you share things that have made them laugh or cry, and they'd love to have those thoughts back in their head again.
Hope that helps. 
Good luck!

Update: After posting this, we're now doing fairly well. I still read other bloggers and follow some, but I won't post "regular" stuff online, because I am busy being a mom and wife.

As well as the other answers, I'd add the following tips:

If you have a lot of friends and family who read Facebook or Twitter, that's a huge source of potential subscribers. 
You could also start writing a series of regular posts, each with a new tip or trick. You could share this on your Facebook page and it will be a lot of work for everyone who follows you. 
Consider asking them to nominate some of their friends to receive the next post and then asking them to spread the word. 

And perhaps a special bonus -

I noticed a link to your blog on the website of a family friend. I have a feeling I may have found the source of your success ;)

All of the above is pretty straightforward, though it does take work. 
Lastly, don't underestimate the effort of just going in and writing - it takes effort to write about how you've eaten a chocolate ice cream cone before, or what you did at your weekend house party, or how your daughter's got her first period and what did you do, or why your father called you a bad name. 
The good news is, once you've written about those things, it's done. 

I am hoping to find my own blog inspiration in the replies to this question!

Also, if you have any other advice - 

Is blogging on a personal journal for yourself?
How do you find your writing and ideas for your blog?
Where do you advertise your blog?

Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.
