"I'm only looking after you because I want to fuck you." " I can't bring home any girls." " I've fucked lots of boys." "You can fuck as many boys as you like when you leave school." "You fuck 'em, I fuck you." "It's how we will settle it." "Well, when I'm older." "All right, fuckable, now you come home with me, and you fuck me, or you're a liar." "Right, we're both going to fuck mama." "But first, you have to fuck mama, then we fuck mama together." "Can't you talk a bit louder?" "They might have knives." "We're talking about killing someone." "I'm sorry, miss, I've told them about the boy." "You can do that, call me by my name." "Catherine." "But you're a child." "And?" "And you're only 15." "And?" "We need the father's consent." "If he doesn't give it, it won't get done." "He'd have to be dead, too." "How?" "I don't know." "Lungs." "Liver." "You decide." "We need to get that boy out of there right now." "Do you need to dress up as a vampire to eat?" "The little boy is too weak to go far." "That's all right." "I've grown quite hungry." "He's in the boot." "Go and get him now." "We'll try and take him back, but we need help from your family first." "I see." "Come back as soon as you can." "You have to take that baby and go back to the old house." "There's no other choice." "Your husband or whoever he is will help you then, too." "It will be safe to leave the baby with him." "We're not going to take the baby back there." "Why not?" "Because we know how they're going to use him." "We know he'll grow up to be like them." "And his father will leave him." "And he won't know who to trust." "Who will look after him?" "Where will we go?" "The safest place is the house under the ground." "Look, your husband, he'll look after you and the child." "He'll see that you're all right." "He'll want to be with you." "No." "You won't go with him, you'll stay here." "With us." "You won't need to go back there." "You'll never have to go back." "The house under the ground..." "I'm going to take this out of you." "I love you." "It's all right." "It's all right." "If that's how it was..." ".. then..." "But he's gone now." "Your husband's gone." "Who is this?" "Is this you?" "You need to stay away from her." "I'm not coming home with you." "We're going to a party." " I want to stay with Ellie." " So do I." "Come on." "I'm starving." "Let's go to the shop and get some food." "But we might not get back before the shop closes." "Can I just phone the shop?" "Yes." "Come on." " Hello?" " How much is the rabbit?" " What do you think?" " A pound, I suppose." " Yeah." " It's a quarter each then." "Hey." "Give us a bit more time, can we?" "I'm hungry." "I'm busy." "I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?" " Can I help you?" " I've got to use the phone." "That's the baby's room, yeah?" "Can I do it here?" "Is it okay?" "That's him." "Oh, I'm sorry." "He's beautiful." "What's his name?" "The boy upstairs asked me to wait here." "He said his son's asleep, he just wants me to wait here with him." "He said he'd give me a reward." "No, don't go." "Come here." "We'll come back later." "We have to go out again now." "Do you like those cookies?" "I got them from the shop." "Yeah." "He's going to need another vase." "Why?" "Because he's dead, Nanna." "Do you know who killed him?" "You're not going to go to the police, are you?" " No." " Why not?" "Because he's dead." "He's not going to do you any harm." "Now, let's go to bed." "Oh, no." "No." "What's the matter?" "I'm sorry, Nanna." "I wanted to be alone with him." "I shouldn't have asked you to come." "It's my fault." "I know." "You're crying." "We have to bury him." "We can't." "He's not buried." "He's lying in the fucking living room." "They'll find him." "And I can't get the smell out of the bed." "We're not going to bury him." "We're just going to put him in a hole in the back garden until it's safe to bury him." " No." "I can't do it here." " I don't care." "He's my baby." "He's mine." "He's not yours, it's not your job to bury him." "It's my job." "I'll do it." " You can't do it on your own." " I won't be on my own." "Why don't you bring your fucking gang of friends?" "You're on your own." "Babe, it's in a cage, it can't get out." "He can't get out." "I can't be alone." "Let's put him in a backpack and take him out the back and bury him." "There's a shovel in the garage." "I'm going." "That's it, all right?" "Come on." "Are you all right?" "Stop!" "Stop!" "Stop!" "Stop!" "Stop." "Where are you going?" "You shouldn't have gone in there!" "What happened?" "I couldn't stop him, all right?" "He just ran out." "It's fine, just stay here." "Just stay here." "Let's get that fucking thing off him!" "What are you doing?" "Calm down!" "Calm down!" "Stop it!" "Calm down, don't take it off." "He can't breathe." "Leave him alone!" "You're crazy!" "Why are you doing that?" "I'm sorry." "I'm sorry." "Why did you fucking bring him here?" " It was an accident." "You mustn't..." " You fucking killed him!" "You're killing him." "I wanted him to be with me." "You killed him!" "Give him to me." "Give him to me!" "Give him to me!" "Give him to me!" "Give him to me!" "Give him to me." "Don't take it off." "Stop, calm down, calm down." "Give him to me!" "We have to go to the police." "We have to tell them what happened." "Yes, I know what happened, all right?" "But no one's going to fucking believe us, not now." "Give him to me." "We need to go." "Come on." "I never should have left him." "They've found a body on the beach." "They'll match the teeth to Nanna's records." " You want me to take you to her?" " No." "Are you sure?" "Yes." "I'm sorry." "He's home now." "You have to go now." "If you want the boy to live, you can't be next door." "What are you saying?" "Please leave him here." "If they suspect you, they'll take the boy away." "They can't separate us." "You have to go now." "Nanna." "Don't let them do it." "Please don't let them do it." "You have to go." "I have to go now." "Nanna?" "Nanna?" "Nanna?" "Nanna?" "Can I have a word, please?" "You have to get out now." "We're trying to hide something here." "We can't hide it, all right?" "We have to find it." "There's been a grave dug here." "Right here." "I was the one who buried her." "The mother's buried at Sandviken." "How did she die?" "She killed herself." "How did she kill herself?" "I just need a moment with my son." "He's my son too." "Get out of the car." "You can't bury him here!" "Do you understand?" "Do you understand?" "I understand he was found dead." "Someone else was buried in his grave." "What's your boy's name?" "My baby boy's name is Samuel." "Okay?" "What is it?" "Hello, sweetheart, it's all right." "Don't be scared, sweetheart." "We're going to take you home, all right</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:48
