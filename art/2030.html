**S'ILVAN TEDDER:** S'ilvan Tedder was probably the first person to manufacture candy in the United States. Born S'ilvan Tedinger in Prussia around 1815, he came to America at a young age and joined his brother, who was already in business in New York City, where S'ilvan managed his shop, which he later purchased from his brother. S'ilvan began producing candy in the 1840s, following the style of French-style bonbons and pastries. He also manufactured candies for a number of other shops in New York City, including J.A. Kessler, Chas. E. Treadwell, Charles L. Fralin, and Henry A. and J. A. Stege.

S'ilvan was married to Rosella Rucker, who died before him. After his death, S'ilvan's daughter Nettie was forced to sell the company and business was moved from 86 Nassau Street to 115 Chambers Street in 1892. A new factory was built in 1907 at 115 Chambers Street, the same building where she ran a candy company from.

**LIPPINCOTT'S:** Lippincott's was founded by two brothers, Benjamin and Isaac P. Lippincott. They were Jewish immigrants from Tiverton, England. They arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1850 with very little money and little knowledge of how to manufacture candy. But the pair did know how to make lollipops. Ben and Issac were soon making enough money to purchase their own small shop on Market Street in Philadelphia. They also hired an apprentice, the son of an English candy maker, to help them with their business.

Ben and Issac's business continued to grow until they were able to expand and move to a larger shop on Chestnut Street. By 1877, they had moved their shop to 757 Chestnut Street, which remained their place of business until 1895.

Ben and Issac married two women, Anna in 1855 and Rebecca in 1872. Ben and Issac had 12 children, six of whom survived to adulthood. Issac, the elder of the brothers, died in 1891, and Ben died eight years later. In 1895, just four years before this book was published, the business sold the building to Louis Weissbuch and his sons.
