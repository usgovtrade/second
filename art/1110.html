It is important to appreciate that when a client seeks our help in a money matters related situation, in many cases it is likely that that individual or their spouse/partner will have been experiencing financial difficulties for some time.
A key step to addressing an existing debt problem is taking control of the situation and understanding how best to deal with this. We will listen to your personal circumstances, advise on the most appropriate course of action and guide you through the entire process, as well as offering the reassurance of our highly specialised debt solution.
If necessary, we may recommend one or more of the following approaches:
An arrangement where creditors agree to accept a reduced payment and waive part or all of the interest and charges due, which may also be repayable over a longer period.
An arrangement where creditors agree to accept an increased payment but with the possibility that part or all of the agreed settlement will be offset against the individual’s earnings in the future.
A proposal to a court with the promise to repay debts in full or a significant part over a set period of time.
A proposal in which part or all of the value of property (usually property that is held jointly) is used to repay creditors.
