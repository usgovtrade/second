A number of students attending the Boston Celtics’ training camp were hit with what was initially believed to be injuries on their arms and shoulders. As it turns out, however, some of the injuries (at least for now) appear to be more serious than the average blister, sprain, or bruise.

The Boston Globe reported that at least two Celtics camp attendees – forward JaJuan Johnson (above right) and guard/forward Al Harrington – will likely be sidelined for an unknown period of time.

Johnson is in his fifth season in the NBA, all of which have been spent with the New Jersey Nets. He appeared in all 82 games last season, averaging 3.1 points, 2.4 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.3 steals per game.

Harrington appeared in 78 games last season, averaging 7.5 points and 3.3 rebounds for the Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers.

The Boston Celtics released a statement today regarding the injuries (here’s the release in its entirety):

Injuries have kept the Boston Celtics from providing full reports on the extent of the injuries to forward JaJuan Johnson and guard Al Harrington. Both men sustained injuries today in practice. Boston is currently waiting for results from all tests to determine their status for tomorrow’s regular season opener.

The Celtics open their 2007-2008 regular season in Philadelphia on Tuesday, October 30 (7:30 p.m. ET on NBC Sports Network, ESPN Radio and CSNNE.com). Boston will then play a home preseason game Friday, November 2 against the Philadelphia 76ers at the TD Garden, as well as an exhibition game at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut.

“We’re going to start with one thing at a time, with our practices,” coach Doc Rivers said before camp opened. “I want guys here on time every day and in the gym. When we start scrimmaging, it’s going to be a little different.”

“I don’t know the severity. JaJuan (Johnson) had a sprained finger and JaJuan was cut pretty bad on his arm,” Rivers said. “We’ll find out [the severity of those injuries] tomorrow.”

Johnson will wear a cast after suffering a cut on his right arm.

“Al is going to have to have some tests done and we’ll find out how serious it is, so we don’t know how severe it is yet,” Rivers said. “He hurt his shoulder and JaJuan had a sprained finger and those two got a little banged up.”

“We’ll have to see how it’s going to play out,” Rivers said.

If Johnson’s shoulder injury is serious, then it could prove to be a major blow to the Celtics. Johnson is the team’s only player who can guard the point, but he’s not a good offensive threat.

If Harrington’s right shoulder is injured, it could be bad news for the Celtics as well, since he would take over point guard duties if either Kendrick Perkins or Anthony Peeler need to miss any games.

The news on Johnson and Harrington adds more urgency to the Celtics’ need to sign a point guard or guard-forward in free agency. Neither Johnson nor Harrington, though, appear to be the ideal candidates to fill the void.

One question that comes to mind is whether either player would be willing to restructure his deal in order to return at a later date. If they’re determined to retire or take a second tour with their respective team, then any potential injuries would likely be worth the risk of a cut in pay.

Both Johnson and Harrington had solid rookie seasons in the NBA, and neither player appears to be the type to accept a lesser role. It’s just not logical for either to sign a deal with an obvious injury clause, in spite of how bad they may feel about missing games or even becoming an afterthought in their careers.

If Johnson or Harrington can heal quickly, then the Celtics will be happy to have him back for the 2007-2008 campaign. But if either player is injured for any extended period of time, it will likely have a negative impact on Boston’s postseason chances in the coming months.

What do you think of the two players and the possibilities for the C’s?

Johnson can be a real force when he's healthy. However, last year he suffered a nasty knee injury and never found his game again. I'd be surprised if he stayed healthy and he was certainly not worth a good contract. Harrington is a little better but had a horrible season last year and will likely continue to play on bad teams around the league. However, a smart team could find a role for him in the right system (such as Boston's) to increase his value.

I don't think either of them will miss any time. If they miss one game it will be a fluke and you should consider them as day to day until they come back. If both Johnson and Harrington were injured then I'd consider their season was over. They only have to miss one game to put them in that situation.

I think both have the potential to be the best offensive player they've ever been. Both are at their best when they're given the freedom to work their game without any help and that is what the Celtics should provide them. If they aren't on the floor, I want the Celtics at least to get open shots, so they are working. If that means Johnson gets the last shot of the game, so be it. He got the last shot on a lot of possessions and he made some great ones. However, there were a couple of bad ones and I don't think that will happen again.

I can't see Johnson missing any time (at least as an injury) in 07-08. If we didn't have the money, I would be looking to extend J-J, or offer him to Orlando or New Jersey as a trading piece.

I would consider Harrington as the best player in the entire NBA - not just as a member of the 76ers (although he really played well for the Sixers).

If we get this guy ready to play in a few weeks, then we have a chance to be a lot better than most give us credit for. With the development of our front court players, we can create some spacing on offense and have some more offensive options on the floor at all times. I think that's an area where the C's were really weak last season. Letting the Sixers outscore us to go along with the defense would have been deadly, and we'll be a lot better defensively once Rondo is back in the lineup.

Plus, if we add a point guard who can push the tempo like Iginla or Vujacic (remembering we'll probably lose Posey and KG for at least part of the season because of injury), we'd be a great offense for years to come.

Jazz arent going anywhere with the big 3. Itd be a very entertaining series but with how healthy we are the celtics would win.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:26
