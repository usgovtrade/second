Mario Bros. 2 Game Tips and Walkthroughs

To play the game successfully, players must understand a few concepts. And in this section, we will discuss a few useful tips and tricks for this game. So, let’s start the game and begin with these tips!

How to Find Items in Mario Bros. 2?

If you want to find some cool and hidden items in this game, just look for broken items on the ground. When a power-up is broken, it’s hidden on the ground. So make sure you pay close attention and take a close look in your surroundings. You can also look for the Power Boost option when you’re at the start of the game. This is usually located next to the item box and can’t be used in battle. If you get hold of one, you’ll have a chance of getting it in battle instead of breaking it, which will allow you to use it in a critical moment.

Power-Ups

You might find a power-up option on the map at the start of the game. It can’t be used in battle and its power will be wasted if you don’t choose to do the minigame. Be careful because it can be a bit of a teaser when choosing this option. On the map, you’ll find four power-ups. The first one is a Shroom that will give you 1% boost in your experience point per every 30 seconds. You can find another one in the second stage of the minigame which will let you perform the Super Shroom which you can access once the game ends. And then you’ll find two yellow stars at the third and final location on the map. You can also find a Mushroom Spores which will allow you to access hidden stages as well as the second and third levels. So, try to find all of them.

How to Get More Rope in Mario Bros. 2?

In Mario Bros. 2, you’ll come across one situation which has four ropes in each stage. So you’ll need a big rope of 10 times so that you can pull the rope up to 15 to allow you to enter the next level. However, you won’t get any rewards for completing the level which is why you’re advised to collect these items in each level so you can start the next stage to get a reward. When you collect all the four ropes in a level, you’ll be transported to the next stage without having to fight an enemy. But you will have to fight monsters that will let you move to the next level. So make sure you collect these items in each level to get to the next stage. So keep this in mind, try to collect it when you find it.

If you complete the game in an unexpected way, make sure you head here to see all the rewards you can get. There are multiple other levels that you can collect a golden key that can be used for the next minigame or secret stage. So it’s highly recommended that you get all the rewards that you can find in any given stage. And so, these are some of the tips and tricks that will help you understand the game better. And if you have any problems with the game, then select another option. All the items you can see in the game like a normal map, an item box or a minigame, will appear in the options. So you’ll find that this game is well organized and you can just select what you want to play. You’ll have a lot of fun, and your enjoyment will increase because of these tips and strategies. So if you have any problems with this game, then just check out our tips and tricks for this game here.
