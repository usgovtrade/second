Our story begins with an
attempt to kill an African witch doctor in 1854.
The witch doctor did not
succeed in killing the
victim, but he did cause
this little boy, Bambata
Muganga, to be sick. And
so the witch doctor was
punished by the people
who knew him and knew
that he had not murdered
his victim, but had
caused the boy to be sick
by magic. And because
the little boy had been
sick, his relatives wanted
to know the cause of
his sickness. But their
witch doctor was still in
prison, so they had to
look elsewhere for an
explanation. And so
they called a Christian
missionary to come and
see if he might know the
cause of the sickness.
The missionary was so
kind and understanding
and sympathetic that
he immediately
understood the cause
of the sickness. And
so he told the boy's
parents how to
expel the evil spirits
from their child. And
so the child is healed
and goes home healthy
and well. Now, then,
back to Bambata and the
ancestors of the Muganda.
The people who came to
them and said, "There
is a devil here. We
cannot understand
why you are sick." And
they were confused
because the Muganda
were a very powerful
people. They had their
own traditions. They
were respected. And
they did not have any
cause for going to a
Christian missionary
and trying to get help
to expel the devil from
the sick boy. But then
they remembered
the evil magic.
So they went in search of this witch doctor.
They went into the
jungle to find him,
because the
Muganda were very
strong in the use of
nature. And so they
followed the traces of
his steps. And after a
while they found the
village and they found
the witch doctor. And
so the witch doctor
began to curse and to
curse them with the
same kind of magic that
had been used on Bambata
Muganga.
But this time he
had it stronger,
and he cursed them.
He cursed the village.
And with the power of
his magic, his curse,
he turned the trees,
the rocks, and the
animals into enemies.
And so they began to
destroy each other and
anything that might be
living and growing
came to an end.
Then the witch doctor
searched for his
prey, for his trophy,
for his victims who
would suffer. And the
Muganda found a man who
had an old mother. And
the witch doctor
brought the curse
upon the old woman's
face and paralyzed her
for life. And so this
old woman was a member
of the Muganda community.
And she was a member
of the extended
family of this witch
doctor, as well as being
a wife of one of her
grandsons.
And there was no way
for the relatives
to reverse the curse
or to heal the curse,
because it was the
authority of a witch
doctor who had made the
curse.
And so the relatives
suffered for the
mistake that they made
of not getting a
Christian
missionary to expel
the witch doctor.
Then the witch doctor,
the enemy of
the Muganda tribe,
took the witch doctor's
daughter from her
father. But the father
would not give the
daughter in marriage to
a European missionary
from the Western
country who had come to
seek them.
And so the daughter
could not get married,
and this was a great
suffering for the witch
doctor's
daughter.
Bambata, the little
boy, had been taken
by the missionaries.
And they nursed him
until he was well. But
this witch doctor would
not help his daughter
at all.
The people were really,
really suffering. And
they did not know why
they were suffering
because the witch
doctor was not here.
He was in prison.
And the Muganda were
so weak that they did
not know how to get
rid of this curse.
And then the chief
of the tribe was sick.
And so he made himself
better by believing
that there was an evil
magic. So they sent for
the witch doctor.
The chief became so
sick that he did not
think he would make it
to the end.
And so he sent for the witch doctor.
He was so sick that he
could not do what he
wanted to do because
of the curse. So they
were all suffering.
They sent for the
witch doctor. But he
did not come.
And so the chief died.
And there was great
suffering, of course.
Then one morning
they woke up to find
that the curse was
still in the land.
And the curse was still
being felt and felt by
everyone.
And so a big problem
had been posed by the
missionary that was able
to make everybody
uncomfortable and to
have everybody sick.
But who was going to
clean up after this
curse that had been
brought in by the
missionary who came
to help people
escape from witch
doctors?
Because they had not
been able to find a
Christian
missionary who was able
to overcome the curse
of the witch doctor,
that curse had gone
into their land and had
had its effect. And the
witch doctor was still
in prison, so he could
not do anything to help.
And so the curse was
felt, and still felt
by the Muganda, but
they could not tell
what it was.
And so this is what
happened in the land of
the Muganda in 1874.
And what did the
Christian missionary
who had tried to help
find the cause of
sickness do?
The missionaries
went back home.
There were no
missionaries there
to do what was necessary
to help the people
of the Muganda.
And so they were left
to suffer the curse
of the witch doctor
which had been brought
into the land through
the Christian
missionary that had
come to try to help the
people but had not
been able to overcome
this evil magic.
The witch doctor had
used that magic upon
the Muganda. And the
Muganda themselves
had been unable to do
anything. They were
helpless to help.
And so all they could
do was suffer.
When you go to Africa,
it is important to
realize that there are
things in Africa
that you cannot
overcome by your own
effort to overcome
them. And you have to
realize that. And
when you go to Africa,
you have to realize
that just because you
are a white Christian
man or a white
Christian woman, that
does not mean you have
a solution to the
problem. It might
be that the problem has
the capacity to destroy
you, because you might
be a white
Christian missionary.
Your life has to
be protected.
It is important to see
the forces that are
present in Africa which
you might not understand
if you just think of
Africa as a place
without religion.
There is an indigenous
pagan religion in Africa.
And so there is a
Christian, as well as
an indigenous pagan
religion.
And we have to think
of Africa as a mixture
of these things. And
we have to realize
that when there is an
element of idolatry
and the use of magic,
this can do damage.
And we have to think
of Africa in this
light. And that
it is a mixture of
things. And you have
to know that. And
it can be dangerous.
And so that is why
the Christians who
come to Africa need to
be very careful.
You cannot be an
opponent of the
pagan religion of
Africa if you are to
be of value and effective
in trying to do what
you are there to do.
You cannot deal with
these forces by saying
to the indigenous
people, "We are
a good religion, and
you must become a
member of us."
And so they say, "No,
we do not want to
become a member of
you. We have a
different religion
from you. We do not
want to become
a Christian.
We do not want to become
like you. We do not
want to be like
you. We want to have
our own religion."
And they do have
their own religions.
And they have to be
respectful to these
languages. And they
have to have their
culture, and their
religion, and their
tradition, and
whatever they have.
And you have to realize
that there is no
