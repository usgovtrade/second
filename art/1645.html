The book's author writes: “The best thing about that is that all of the information was publicly available on our websites for years, only to be suppressed by a single judge (without hearing evidence, by the way) in the United States. So, essentially, he found out that it was legal to smoke marijuana, watch pornography, have sex, and watch sports on the internet, but not to watch a porn movie on YouTube.”

Borkowsky says they are now targeting the decision.

“Today’s news is good for the legal marijuana industry and for adult businesses and consumers,” he said in a statement to the Colorado Sun. “This Court of Appeals ruling has the effect of clarifying the state’s law on how the internet is governed as a public utility. We’ve gone to extraordinary lengths for some in the government to be able to say the internet is a utility, yet they continue to ignore Colorado’s voters.”

The plaintiffs in the case have filed petitions for a hearing before the Colorado Supreme Court.
