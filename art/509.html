interested in working with me.  It would be great to have you on the team, 
and I think the two of us could really do some things for the company.  I'm 
scheduled to go to South America next week, but perhaps we could talk before 
then and discuss it further.  If you would please send me your resume again, 
I would be happy to keep it on file.  

Thank you again for lunch, and I look forward to seeing you this weekend.

Best,
Jeff

PS I was in and out all morning today on client calls.  Give me a call before 
lunch tomorrow and I'll fill you in on the status.

Hi Jeff,

My name is Tiffany Scholz and I am the resume you emailed on
February 16th.  I just wanted to check with you to see if
you had any news on a potential job position with Enron.  I am
very interested in moving to the TX.  Do you think there is a
possibility that you will get back with me?  If so, when I
might be able to call you?

Sincerely,
Tiffany
