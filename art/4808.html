There is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures in elderly patients. The goal of the present study was to examine whether there is a decreased rate of complications after internal fixation of intertrochanteric hip fractures in patients 75 years and older, compared to internal fixation performed in younger patients. A total of 589 intertrochanteric hip fractures were treated with internal fixation at one university hospital. The age- and fracture-specific rate of complications was compared in patients 75 years and older and younger patients. Hip fracture surgery was performed more frequently in patients 75 years and older (60%) than in younger patients (42%) (p < 0.001). Within the group of patients 75 years and older, there were no significant differences in the fracture-specific rate of complications between internal fixation with a DHS or Gamma nail. These findings support the view that an anatomic reduction can be safely achieved in elderly patients with a DHS. Additional studies should be performed to establish the optimal treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures in patients 75 years and older, especially as the age-specific rate of complications after fixation of intertrochanteric hip fractures is not uniform.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:27
