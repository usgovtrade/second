On September 8, 2016, the National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report on the accident.

Boeing 787, N787WX, was registered on June 15, 2011 and had flown 19,361 hours when it was lost in early November 2016. The aircraft was powered by two General Electric CF6-80C1A1 engines. This model aircraft was registered to Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings LLC of Palmdale, CA. N787WX was delivered to Atlas Air on September 22, 2011.

The following people were the three people on board when the accident occurred:

Captain John Cousins, age 52, most recently with Atlas Air since June 25, 2016. Cousins had 4,968 hours of flight experience and 3,822 hours in the 777. He had accumulated a total of 5,739 flight hours, including 2,852 hours in the 777. He had been qualified as Pilot in Command since December 10, 2013, and prior to that, held the CFII rating. Cousins had worked as a flight instructor since 1992, and had an instructor rating. He joined Atlas Air on October 1, 2013 and worked in the first officer position.

First Officer Brian Eller, age 44, most recently with Atlas Air since October 1, 2013. Eller had accumulated 12,230 flight hours, of which 4,977 hours were in the 777. He had been qualified as a check airman since October 1, 2007. Eller was previously employed as a customer service specialist for UPS in Chicago.

Assistant Flight Attendants Erin McGrath, age 27, and Allison Kendall, age 26, most recently with Atlas Air since November 1, 2013. McGrath had accumulated 2,974 flight hours, of which 1,936 hours were in the 777. McGrath had been qualified as an flight attendant since November 15, 2011. Kendall had accumulated 2,931 hours of flight experience, of which 1,834 hours were in the 777. She had been qualified as a flight attendant since February 25, 2011.

Flight 787: The Accident

The airline stated the crew flew the airplane on an ILS approach to Los Angeles International Airport for landing from Orange County airport. However, they were not cleared to land and they proceeded in a holding pattern. Witnesses report that at 16:00 UTC the airplane was flying at a higher speed than normal, about 370 knots indicated airspeed, which was considered high. The pilot stated that the airplane started to descend about 5 minutes before landing. The captain communicated with air traffic controllers about turbulence and other factors. A witness reported seeing a parachute in the airplane prior to impact, indicating that a crew member bailed out of the airplane. The airplane was still descending at impact, at about 690 feet per minute, and impacted on the southern side of Runway 33 with an approach speed of approximately 100 knots, or 124 mph.

The airplane was found about 6.5 miles (10.5 km) northwest of Los Angeles International Airport. Witnesses reported observing two parachutes.

All four flight attendants and three passengers survived, with the attendant closest to the door sustaining serious injuries.

Investigation and Findings

No post-accident examination of the airplane was possible, as there was no airplane wreckage left at the accident site. The NTSB has stated that there was no evidence that the accident was caused by issues with flight control computers or software.

Based on statements made by the three crewmembers and by two flight attendants during interviews, the NTSB determined the following:

The flight crew encountered severe turbulence in a holding pattern. The captain declared a missed approach.

The flight crew was unable to follow their missed approach procedure checklist because of severe turbulence. The captain tried to gain a higher altitude to improve conditions. The captain discussed turning back towards Los Angeles or diverting to Las Vegas Airport, but decided to continue the approach.

The captain made a right turn to line up with the airport.

The airplane was descending about 400 feet per minute, and the aircraft was about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) northwest of the airport.

The flight crew made an unintentional 90 degree left turn at 200 knots, or about 315 mph.

At 200 knots, or about 315 mph, the airplane had reached a speed below the stall speed of 140 knots, or about 185 mph, and the airplane began to pitch down to the stalling angle of attack.

At 200 knots, or about 315 mph, a left-hand spiral mode of oscillation began with a -1/4 degree pitch attitude. It was not possible for the flight crew to control the airplane in time to recover from the oscillation without stalling.

There was a total of five aileron control inputs made during the five seconds prior to impact.

The airplane impacted the southern edge of the runway at a banked angle of 40°. It bounced and slid along the ground for about 1,000 feet, then came to rest in a field near the runway. The nose was resting upright and the right wing was down on the ground.

The aircraft was destroyed by the impact and fire. There were no survivors.

The NTSB concluded that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew’s poor decision to enter a holding pattern in IMC conditions, which resulted in the onset of an aerodynamic stall, followed by an uncontrolled descent. They determined that the flight crew had sufficient time and altitude to recover from the approach without any engine thrust available, but failed to execute a go-around or divert to Las Vegas. This allowed them to continue the approach, resulting in a loss of airplane control, which caused the crash.

NTSB Safety Recommendations

Make sure that the flight crew fully understand the limitations of their position. They should have a complete awareness of their role in the decision-making process, and any limitations that apply to them. Make sure the flight crew review and understand the following topics: The Pilot in Command’s Responsibilities in an IFR Hold Before takeoff The Pilot in Command’s Duties and Responsibilities in the event of a loss of electrical power on the ground

The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA) directs the NTSB to conduct an independent analysis of each accident or serious incident in an airplane with a standard airworthiness certificate that occurred after September 21, 2002. The analysis must include the probable cause of the accident and propose safety recommendations. This analysis should determine if corrective action is necessary to reduce the risk of similar accidents in the future.

Mishaps:

The Accident Response Operations Section conducts an accident investigation of each accident to determine the probable cause of the mishap and to prevent similar mishaps.

On December 14, 2009, NASA contracted with ATS Airlines to operate a commercial flight with NASA cargo under a blanket order for up to two additional flights through ATS. ATS Airlines' Boeing 757 was flown in a NASA shuttle launch vehicle modification, configured with 2,566 square feet of floor space on the main deck. The modification included an external loading system for cargo delivery, a second galley for astronauts and a mobile workstation which allowed one astronaut to perform tasks simultaneously from the cockpit and from the main deck to control the Canadarm 2 and work outside the Shuttle orbiter on the exterior of the craft.

The pilot and passenger were practicing an approach for NASA flight operations and both died in the crash. The pilot had about 4,500 total flight hours and the passenger had about 10,500 total flight hours.

Examination revealed that the left flap on the airplane was in the down position when the accident occurred. According to the pilot's manual, the flaps on this aircraft could be retracted only one at a time. The right flap was retracted to the stop position before the accident, which was believed to cause the airplane to pitch down at high speed.The airplane struck the ground inverted and the right wing separated from the airplane during the crash sequence.

Boeing 747-400-SF, N747MC, operating as United Airlines Flight 811, was en route from Frankfurt, Germany to Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, Washington State.
