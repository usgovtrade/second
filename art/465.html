[A little later, while Lorn 
is drinking in his quarters
. . . ]

". . . there were six men who 
came to us from High Meadow
. . . ."
"How did you know that . . ."

[After a moment, Lorn 
sighs and puts his hand to 
his neck. The wounds left by 
the spikes and the whip seem 
to have healed.]

"Well, what else did you do 
besides torture them?"
"Nothing. I'm afraid we did 
nothing else."

[Lorn sighs again.]
"My friend the Duke of Linoree 
has an odd penchant for 
experimentation. I have seen 
all sorts of things . . .  at 
times."
"I've no doubt that you have, 
my dear, but I'm not sure how 
these two relate."
"Really?" Lorn asks, with a 
smile. "And why would that 
make a difference?"

"Well, we might be looking at 
something new, here . . .
a type of weapon or fighting 
method never seen before. 
Theories say that, generally,
. . .
. . . men and women are 
similar when it comes to their 
bodies, but that men have a
. . . a . . . tendency toward 
violence . . . 
or aggression."
"The only thing that interests 
me about this report is that
. . . no one came to harm while 
you experimented with them,
. . . except Lyrone."
"Oh."
"What?"
"You wouldn't be a little 
curious about that?"
"Curious? Of course! This is 
the weapon that beat her . . .
is it not?"
"But . . . I suppose . . ."
"You must have been very 
careful with them."
"Oh, of course."

[The two young women are 
quiet.]
"Well, I'm going to look into 
it. It might be helpful for 
those that are working to try 
and use what they know about 
the fighting styles of the men 
of Rynar. The other day I saw 
some men and women from 
High Meadow and they gave some 
useful advice."
"I shall talk to you when we 
return . . . a bit more."
"Of course."

"My lady."
"Yes, my lord?"
"Do you have any other . . . 
experiments to share with me?"
[Silence. Lorn gets up and 
walks to the door of the cell.]
"I . . . that is, I will have to
put you back in your cells for 
now. I must attend a meeting 
with the lord and the other 
captains. I shall be back soon.
Don't let anyone disturb you.

[She rises, and the 
apprentices turn their backs.
When Lorn is at the door, he 
holds out his hand to the 
prisoners.]
"Ladies. Forgive me."
"Of course, my lord."

[When Lorn leaves, the woman
goes to the window to try to 
break it out with her hands, 
but it doesn't budge.]

"Let's hope this weather 
changes for the better. It 
should make the coming days a 
little bit more . . . well,
normal. At least it's bright 
enough to do some weaving. 
You can help with that if you 
want."

[. . . which is good, because
she finds it hard to move her 
arms.]

[During this exchange, the
female apprentice is cutting up
the bandages in her lap, and 
some blood begins to flow down 
her arm.]
"What are you doing?"
"What?"

[She's going through Lorn's
equipment, looking for the 
things she'll need to make 
bandages, but at some point 
she must have hit the hidden 
switch. The entire room fills 
with the sound of clashing 
metal. A huge, spiked metal 
halo of blades begins to rise 
over the room. In moments it's
half-way to the ceiling.]
"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
"Stop what? I'm so sorry. It 
must be one of the buttons I 
must have pressed. It seems to 
do that sometimes."
"You're not going to tell me, 
are you?"
"I beg your pardon?"
"Never mind."

[Soon enough, the metal 
halo begins to come down. The 
apprentices start to get up and
run for the door, but when they
reach the bottom step . . . 
everything in the room is covered
in blood.]

"What happened? Oh, no."

[There's a loud crash, the
windows shatter, and a cloud of
dust fills the room. The
apprentice is covered in blood.
She starts to pick herself up 
but, when she stands, she is a
man. He takes a step towards 
the door.]
"Please . . . wait!"
"Wait for what?"
"To . . . to . . . for . . . the
other one . . . please. Please.
No, no, please . . ."
"Who are you?"
"Please don't . . . . . . . hurt 
me!"

[As Lorn gets closer, he
takes his sword and swings it 
at the man. It hits the door, 
but the blade merely bounces 
off the metal and shatters on
the stone floor. Lorn tries to 
get closer, but each time he
jabs his sword, it just bounces 
off. He can't get the weapon 
to break. He tries again, 
trying to find a vulnerable 
spot, but the result is always 
the same. . . . 
he misses.]

"This is the way. Take . . .
take . . . take your time. You 
won't hurt me. 
I promise . . ."
"Who are you? Are you . . . are
you some kind of wizard or 
something? I don't think you 
would even have time to . . .
. . .
. . . do something like that."
"Please . . . . . . . Please . . 
. stop!

[He takes his sword and
swings it at the man, and 
again it bounces off and shatters
on the floor.]

"No! No, please! I'm 
telling you the truth! This is 
the way . . . it's the only 
way . . . . . . . No! No! No!"

[He steps closer to the man 
who's pleading to be spared.
But Lorn can't stop him from
getting closer.]
"No! No! No! Please . . . . .
. . .
. . . don't do this to me."
"Why are you doing this to me?"

[Lorn steps forward, but 
he's stopped short by a sudden
pain in his chest. He gasps 
and lets out a sharp scream as
he tries to run towards the
man, but he's too late, and his
sword falls uselessly to the
floor. He looks down, and he
sees what has happened.]

"No . . . . . . . No!"
[He drops the sword as the
man's hand shoots up and grabs
Lorn's right index finger. He
starts to pull it down, but 
Lorn sees the blood coming 
out. He screams, but still the
man pulls his finger down.]

"No! No! No! NO!"
[There are three more 
squeals, and then silence. 
Lorn's eyes are open, but he
sees nothing. The man has 
fallen face-down on the floor 
and Lorn now realizes what has
happened. He feels around with 
his fingers and finds he can't
move his right leg. His arm and
his hand are still attached to
his body, but the man's hand 
is the only thing holding his
body up, and he can't move his
leg. 
He's in pain, but he can't do 
anything. The room is cold, and
he's losing feeling in his left 
side. He sees his sword next to
the wall where he was
standing. He tries to say 
something</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:36
