(R.E.D. is known for his love of the Doors' greatest hits.)

From there, R.E.D. went on to form the pop-punk band called the New Loudness which he said "could never quite seem to get a proper recording contract because of [its] unrelenting, anthemic, aggressive sound. Despite our unquenchable drive to create and share that sound, it also seemed to have more than its share of detractors. There was very little in the way of mainstream acceptance... But in the end, and thanks to our efforts, they were dead wrong."

While a member of the New Loudness, R.E.D. met his future wife, the drummer for the band. They became good friends, and R.E.D. began writing songs together.  They soon formed an R&B group called The Flames.  After that group broke up, R.E.D. joined forces with longtime friend, Benji, to form Love Battery in 1993.  The band disbanded in 1995.

R.E.D. went on to write and record the album titled “This Life, Our Life” with members of his future band, The Dirty Heads.  Their self-released album was called, "Love Is the Answer" and has become a cult hit on the internet over the past seven years.

In September 2012, R.E.D. decided to leave the Dirty Heads, having grown weary of the traveling schedule and pressure of constant performances to "make a living in music."

R.E.D. and his wife moved to Palm Desert, CA, to start a family and have a new start. On October 1, 2014, he released the acoustic tribute song "In Memory of Eddie Money" which R.E.D. wrote about his friend and fellow musician who died of a drug overdose at age 48. He wrote the song with The Dirty Heads for the release of a vinyl EP called Undo The Right Ones: A Tribute to Eddie Money.

R.E.D.'s first solo album, titled "I Hope You're Sitting Down," was released June 17, 2015. The album was dedicated to his late brother, Tim LeBlanc, who died after a 20-year battle with a rare form of cancer.

A tribute album to R.E.D. was released in September 2017 with over 250 artists contributing, titled "Letters to R.E.D.," produced and arranged by Benji Madden, and arranged and produced by Joel Kanitz.  The Letters to R.E.D. track list and more information can be found here:
