There were several amazing moments for the children at one end of the venue and a fun time was had by all.

In just a little over 5 years the band has achieved and overshadowed many other bands in the area and across the Country. They’ve proven they can come to a new city and not only perform but connect with the audience, all on the strength of their talent, song writing and delivery. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it!

The band is an experience you will never forget. So put on your cowboy hat and dust off that cowboy bandana and come out and join in the fun with The Real McCoy.

One Response to “The Real McCoy at the Redneck River Rally – June 2016”

Hi there we are very sad to inform you that the band will no longer perform together. They have all been in other bands and decided they don’t like performing, they are going their separate ways and getting full time jobs to support their families. They wish to thank you for your support over the years and are sorry they will not be able to attend your wedding. Good luck to them and we wish them well in all their future endeavors and hope to see you at another show.
