Instead icing sugar is used. In some regions the icing is mixed with an egg white and a cup of lemonade to make a lemon icing. In some parts of Germany and Austria a sour-almond-and-sugar icing is used, and this is a very popular icing in Berlin, where they call it _Punschkompott_ (punch-cake).

There is a great deal of difference in the way this is prepared, as for example, some mix the icing with eggs to make a thick custard which sets and become very firm, but in Berlin they mix the icing with an egg white, which gives a more fluid icing. This is then mixed with an equal amount of powdered sugar and beaten with an egg beater until it makes a smooth creamy mixture which sets. This is flavored by adding a strong flavoring like rum, coffee, or fruit and nut extracts, and the mixture is thinned with a little hot water or rum. When it is thoroughly mixed it is divided into equal parts and put into individual pastry bags, the bag being provided with a large star tip.

When filling the cake, use a small icing tube, or scoop up some of the icing and pour it over with a spatula onto the cake. Use a little less than one-third as much icing as you think the cake needs, because if you put too much on it will run over.

Sometimes the icing is sprinkled with chopped nuts, raisins, or sliced almonds. When the cake is cold, the icing is sometimes smoothed over with a wet knife, or, if you prefer, it can be spread with a metal spatula.

Some people add some candied orange or lemon peel to the icing before filling it. Others like to use real orange or lemon juice to flavor the icing.

Sometimes one can buy plain boiled icing from the shops and this is often used for the filling, but it isn't quite so good as the icing made at home.

CHOCOLATE ICING

Butter two small earthenware bowls (the size of milk glasses) and put the chocolate into one of them.

Put the other bowl in a pan of hot water and bring to a boil. As soon as the water boils, pour over the chocolate and stir with a silver spoon until the chocolate is melted.

Sieve together 2 parts confectioners' sugar and 1 part flour and sift into the chocolate. Whisk it with an egg beater until the mixture thickens and turns a warm brown.

Put into a clean bowl and leave to cool. It can be used at once, or after cooling it can be cut into small pieces for making cakes.

This icing is sometimes flavored with an extract, especially orange.

CRÈME FROSTING

Boil some water and put in an egg yolk.

When the egg is well boiled put it through a wire sieve to press out the moisture, and then beat the egg yolk until thick and light.

Put some confectioners' sugar and hot water into a saucepan and stir until the sugar is dissolved and the water is clear.

Stir a tablespoon of hot water into a cup of freshly made white wine, which can be flavored with wine vinegar, lemon, or lime juice, but must not be used with the milk.

Put the egg yolk into the sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves and it begins to thicken.

Beat the mixture with a wooden spoon for several minutes until it is quite light and white. Beat in the rest of the sugar and leave until cold, stirring it from time to time to prevent it from hardening or it will have a gritty texture. When the icing is firm and has been smoothed it is ready to spread on cakes.

If it is too stiff to spread, beat in a little hot water until it has the right consistency. If you are making the icing on a very hot day, you can always beat in some melted ice cream or use canned evaporated milk instead of milk.

COTTAGE PIE

Butter a large pie dish and line the bottom with pastry, rolled out to a ½ inch thickness.

Pile into it enough dried, cooked and sliced, or uncooked, chestnuts to cover the pastry, and cover with a layer of chopped apple or mixed apple and raisins.

Squeeze lemon juice over the mixture and sprinkle with sugar.

For a sweet crust put in ½ cup sifted confectioners' sugar mixed with 1 tablespoon of water, a dash of brandy, and enough milk to make a thick mixture.

Brush over the crust with a pastry brush dipped in water, sprinkle with grated almonds, and dot with butter.

Cover with pastry and roll a lid out for the pie dish. If any crust is left, it can be cut into strips and used as strips of pastry. Put it into a saucepan and steam until the strips are well cooked through and brown. Put the pie on a folded cloth and tie it up, and serve it hot.

A variation of this recipe is made by wrapping the pastry crust around the outside of the filled pie dish and by tying a wooden spoon and a little bag of brandy, wine, or rum, round the pie. This method makes a pie which has a very decorative appearance.

RASPBERRY TART

Roll out a piece of pastry an inch and a half larger all around than the pie dish in which it is to be baked. Fold over the edges of the pastry to keep the raspberry jam from running over. Bake as usual.

The following two recipes come from the German section of the F.H.C. in W.C.

LEMON CURD

4 eggs

1⅓ cups sugar

1½ cups cream

Juice and grated rind of ½ lemon

Beat the eggs in a bowl.

In another bowl beat the sugar to a cream, adding the grated lemon rind.

Add the eggs gradually, then the cream. Mix thoroughly.

Pour into a well-buttered tart mold and bake at 350° for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the pastry is a golden brown.

FRUIT CAKES

A fruit cake does not need so much beating as an ordinary cake. It is only important that it should be of a fairly even consistency.

APPLE FRUIT CAKE

2 cups wholemeal flour

1 cup sugar

¼ cup melted butter

2 teaspoons baking powder

2 cups sultanas (golden raisins)

½ cup molasses

1 teaspoon each of ginger, cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, and cloves

Grated rind of 1 lemon

2–3 teaspoons lemon juice

2 eggs

½ cup milk

½ pound butter

Mix together the sultanas, molasses, lemon, spices, and grated rind of the lemon, and let stand in a cool place overnight.

The next day put them in the top of a double boiler and set over hot water and let simmer until thick.

Beat the eggs well with the milk and melted butter, and when they are smooth add the sugar and flour.

Add the hot fruit and combine, then add the spices and lemon juice, and bake in a moderate oven for about ½ hour, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.

A quick-cooking fruit cake may be made by beating the fruit together with the butter and sugar, and then adding the sifted flour, egg, and milk mixture and baked in a moderate oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.

Butter and flour a cake pan about 10 inches long and 5 inches wide.

Beat the butter until light and then gradually add the sugar.

Add the fruit and mix well.

Mix the dry ingredients and sift them together.

Add the dry ingredients to the fruit.

Bake in a moderate oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the cake is done.

BREAD CAKE

1 pound flour

1¼ cups sugar

½ cup chopped raisins

4 cups milk

½ teaspoon each of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

½ pound butter

2 eggs, well beaten

¼ pound sultanas

½ cup toasted breadcrumbs

Cream together the butter, sugar, and raisins until soft and creamy.

In a separate bowl beat the eggs, the milk, and vanilla extract, sift in the flour, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, and beat them in.

Now add the fruit and the breadcrumbs and mix until you have a stiff dough.

Turn into a buttered pan and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the cake shrinks slightly from the sides of the pan.

BRAN CAKE

1 cup wholewheat flour

2 cups bran

1 teaspoon soda

½ teaspoon salt

1 cup sweet milk

1 cup molasses

1 cup sour cream

¼ cup melted butter

1 tablespoon lemon juice

Mix the flour and bran together and sift this mixture through a</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:11
