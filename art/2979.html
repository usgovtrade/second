things that they
would never say in a formal interview.
So you have to be careful of that.
Now these are not foolproof.
They're not foolproof, right?
Because remember we live in a world
where we do the job search with email,
with text messages, with video clips.
So you can go back through all of that.
Don't use this as a substitute for an interview.
But you might find it helpful.
So for example, it's going to make you
think about your strengths and weaknesses
so you can get them.
And I see a lot of people say things
like I think my strengths are my
problem solving skills and my analytical skills.
I don't really know what they're like, right?
I don't know, how am I really going to say?
These aren't things I can look at in the real world.
They're all hypothetical.
So what I'd want to say is
you got strengths, you got weaknesses.
But you don't have to have a job right now.
You don't have to have any interviews.
You can just be like I don't know
what these skills are like.
And it would also be a good idea
to think about that
so that you can go into your interviews
and be confident in yourself.
Like this is where you can ask your friends.
Go to work and ask your friends at work.
What do you think I'm good at?
What can I improve?
Go get involved in things.
It would be a great idea.
Maybe that's something that you didn't do last time,
but if it's something that you like,
try and learn how to play the sport.
See how you can get better.
Maybe that's something new for you, and
get good at that.
And you can also do it if
you're in school
and you're trying to get a particular major.
I see a lot of people come in here
and they don't even know the difference.
And they're like I want to be a nurse, but
I don't know what the major is for that.
You need to find that out.
You can look it up.
You can ask people.
Make sure you're getting as many skills as possible.
So this is a good resume that goes into
your resume.
Your resume is very important as well.
I don't know why, if I see a resume like this,
I'm not going to do anything.
I'm not going to want to read it.
I'm not going to think that you're a smart person.
You don't look like a smart person.
Why would I want to hire you?
What can you do for me?
So make sure that you look presentable.
You're going to put it out there
and people are going to start seeing it.
Okay so those are things that
you want to think about.
But the biggest thing for me is don't be afraid
to take risks.
We live in a world
where a lot of people aren't willing to risk.
They're not willing to go and get a job
because that might not work out.
Maybe you do really badly.
Maybe you don't do so well, or
maybe you feel a little bit uncomfortable.
People are willing to get a job when they have to.
I think it's a smart thing to do.
Why would you want to give up?
Why would you want to risk?
I understand sometimes, you may feel out of place.
You may feel a little out of shape.
You may feel like you're not fit
to do whatever it is, but that's
why you got to be a little bit bold.
I see a lot of people
when they go out for a job, and they've never done it before,
it's so scary because they don't know what to do.
So when you take these risks,
you're going to be a lot happier.
You're going to be in a much better place.
Take risks.
Don't be afraid.
I want to hear about your stories.
What have you been out there and done?
What have you done to make it happen?
I want to hear about your stories,
I want to see what you've been doing.
And maybe I can implement that.
And I want to see what you've been doing,
how you can do it.
I want to give you ideas.
I want to see what you've done before.
I want to see what kind of mindset you're in.
And again, we'll take a lot more calls
on this subject if you have questions.
If you feel that you're a little bit stuck
or you feel that you're a little bit indecisive,
then talk to us.
We're going to give you the resources that you need.
We're going to help you through that.
That's what we're here for.
I think that will be the best way to get up to speed.
And if you don't have a call, feel free to leave your name
and I will give you a shout out on the screen.
I can't promise that I'll respond to you.
But I do have a lot of followers who leave their email
on the screen, and I can respond to them and reach out.
But if you've got a question and you need some help,
feel free to leave your email.
