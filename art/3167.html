"Then, You Can'T!" "You must save us, and bring peace to Shiong" "I'm begging you..." "Come... come on... come on" "This is bullshit..." "I said, I'll kill you!" "That's the only way out" "There's got to be another way out" "Let's just think about it..." "What's there to think about?" "It's either me or them" "If you leave, it'll be them!" "It's easier to be a terrorist than a murderer..." "You really want to die?" "You know something, I can't remember" "What?" "Who I was talking to..." "What'd you say?" "I can't remember who I was talking to" "Someone was in your hand when I stabbed you" "Who was it?" "He said something very important... and then..." "Just a few words, and you killed him?" "I think so" "I didn't!" "And there were five of them!" "I saw them, killing you" "I only remember two men" "The 5th?" "I don't know" "Someone told me..." "I killed them!" "Can we get up now?" "It's not fair, you two just get up" "Shit!" "You can't kill us with that" "It's not loaded, that's why you keep saying it's not fair" "I'm going to shoot you" "Come!" "He's still alive..." "It's so unfair!" "Don't..." "Stop it..." "It's so unfair!" "Don't..." "Stop it..." "You two..." "Get lost!" "This is your last chance" "Go get your mother and tell her to quit this shit" "It's really unfair" "Stop it" "Is he dead?" "Don't shoot him..." "I..." "I don't wanna die..." "I'm sorry!" "Please, let me live" "I don't want to die..." "Don't do it, I'm begging you..." "No one else has to die" "Just me" "Don't shoot" "You... you're going to be killed..." "If I do, what about you?" "I'm begging you..." "Why is he telling her to go?" "Is it... about sex?" "You bastard!" "He can't die" "Don't you guys leave me alone" "Don't..." "What're you doing?" "Don't..." "This will settle the score for your brother" "Is there still time?" "He's alive, but it's way too late" "What do we do?" "Just look at that mess" "We have no choice but to put a showdown" "We'll take turns shooting him" "Yes, that'll give us chance to escape" "After we're killed, you take care of yourselves" "Stop it!" "Wait!" "It'll be unfair if we don't kill them together" "I've got an idea..." "I'll go and give a call for help..." "You two have to go out and fight him" "That's unfair!" "Who said I was fighting?" "No one said so?" "Yes, we said so..." "I see" "I'll kill them all!" "If you agree, just nod your head" "What are you waiting for?" "Just nod your head" "Go out and fight him!" "Please" "You have to let me go" "No way!" "Take me with you..." "I'm gonna be killed" "You can go out and live" "It's better than being killed together..." "No..." "You want to go?" "Why not?" "If you go, I'll be lonely" "Take her with you!" "She wants to go!" "Let me go..." "Please let me go!" "What're you doing?" "No..." "Come on" "Don't..." "Please, don't kill me..." "Don't..." "I don't wanna die!" "This isn't fair..." "I was gonna let you go" "Let's end it here" "Are you sure?" "Why're you doing this?" "Why do you want to die so bad?" "She killed me!" "It's not fair..." "I got you killed before" "Give me my gun" "Don't you kill him!" "Get out of here" "Hurry!" "He's gonna kill you..." "Run!" "We know, we can't kill him" "If we do that we're also gonna die" "If he kills you, he has to come out" "We'll shoot him" "If it's not empty, you might miss, and if it's empty, we might miss too" "It will be unfair!" "That's why I shot him first" "Then, Why did you shoot me?" "Why?" "Because I'm not qualified to say anything now" "Why are you crying?" "I am too" "A girl named Mika" "She was my little sister" "She's in a cult, right now, in a desert" "She's 13 now" "Her name is Kozue..." "She was my best friend" "And... she was kidnapped" "I promised my father to go rescue her" "And that was the last time I saw him..." "Kozue..." "I... can't forget her face..." "There's no reason for you to take Kozue's life" "That is your responsibility" "I can't die now, so you have to die" "Let's go... no..." "Don't come any closer" "We can go out from back..." "This way... hurry!" "No!" "Go away, I'm begging you" "Can't you let me die in peace?" "Please..." "I..." "I can't shoot a friend" "You're not going to shoot him..." "Don't come any closer" "Can't you come back later, please?" "That's not possible!" "I have to kill him now" "What're you gonna do?" "Take a seat over there" "Over there" "Don't you want him to die?" "Why did you do that to me?" "That doesn't have any meaning..." "If you don't shoot him you'll get killed..." "It's meaningless for you to have a friend" "You just want to have a friend!" "You didn't save me just for yourself, right?" "It's not for myself" "Then, why'd you try to save me?" "Because..." "I..." "Then, just do it" "I'll let him shoot you" "Why don't you let him shoot you?" "Don't come any closer" "Then, I'll give you my gun" "There's a gun behind you" "No... not my own gun" "You're bleeding so bad..." "I'll kill him with it..." "You said it wasn't loaded" "It wasn't" "I said, It's not loaded, didn't I?" "This one is real" "If you try to trick me..." "I'll kill him with this" "The gun I gave him is real too" "He'll die" "I know I'll die" "I'll die for sure..." "Don't come any closer" "Please..." "I beg you..." "Tell me..." "Did you let him shoot you?" "Yes..." "But not really..." "How..." "I'm not sure whether I killed him or not..." "You must be relieved..." "Did I shoot him?" "I'm sorry" "It's not your fault..." "Can't you do me one more favor?" "He told me to ask you..." "I want you to go in front of him and shoot him... I'm afraid" "That means, you did let him shoot you" "That was unfair of you!" "Please... hurry" "Hey, hurry up!" "Don't stop!" "Please don't..." "Don't stop!" "Stop..." "please don't..." "My friend told me to tell you..." "Please!" "Please!" "Then, you must die" "I will die..." "Just not here..." "Don't kill me..." "You promised" "What was that about?" "Are you satisfied?" "I'm talking about you" "It was you who killed him" "So what?" "I was only doing my job" "So that means you're allowed to kill him?" "Are you allowed to kill anyone if you want to?" "That's the job" "That's stupid" "What about his family?" "What're you gonna do?" "If you do this again, you'll be expelled from Japan" "Do you understand?" "I'm sorry..." "There was a time when you were really cool..." "What's that supposed to mean?" "You can't kill him if you're cool" "Don't you know that?" "Tell me... it's... me" "I'm not sure whether I killed him or not..." "I didn't mean to tell him that" "I just wanted to give him a feeling that you were his friend..." "Don't come any closer..." "Please let me die" "Go away..." "We don't want to kill you" "We don't even know each other" "Go away..." "You were going to shoot him in the back, weren</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:40
