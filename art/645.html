something an elementary school student is dancing. if i see it again, i am reporting it. 
i am not making this up. i am just repeating what i see on the internet. 
is this the way you dance. i need your answer now and more later. 
next we have to do, 
as a country, 
some kind of self-respect. 
is this the image that you want to present the world? 
no, it is not. it is not going to help. the 
world knows you for what you are. 
that is not how you are going to win the votes of the people who really 
have the power. what do they have? the have the power to send the 
country to the trash. that is what they have. they 
have the power to do it. they have not been shy 
about telling us. it is on the line for you to 
see that their power has been abused. 
and you might not believe this, but 
they vote and they will vote for a candidate who cares about them. 
so 
you need to begin by caring. 
i know you care. 
you care a lot. 
thank you. 
but do you care enough? 
would you like to do better? 
would you like to stop the fighting? 
would you like to get in there and try to fix the problem? 
i can't think of anything else 
that would be any easier. 
why don't you do it? 
why don't you go ahead and try. if you can do it, i'll be behind you. 
otherwise, you can say okay, i'll go ahead 
and do what you suggest. 
for the next three years, i will be pushing this. 
maybe i should start by saying. please. 
yes, the time has come for the right to stop the fighting. 
this is why i am doing this. i am doing this for you. 
this is the reason i have come. i 
came to stop the fighting. 
you are sick of the fighting? 
you want it to stop? you're tired of it? 
then why don't you do something about it? if you don't have any 
power, get 
some power. find a way to fix the problem. 
that is what i would advise. 
so if you give that a chance, there is another 
reason for coming. i know you came 
here today because you want a victory. we all want a victory. 
but what would victory mean? 
would victory mean that we would get a 
majority in the house? 
would victory mean that we get more votes in the house? 
would victory mean that the people would elect us as president? 
yes, i want a victory in the house. 
but what is going to happen? i can't tell you because 
he has 
changed the rules. he is more powerful than the presidency. 
he can have the most powerful person in the world. 
he could be the only person in the world. you 
don't have to worry about this, but you have to be willing to pay a 
price. i am willing to pay a price. i have always paid a price. 
i have paid a price all of my life. people do not understand that 
i have a wife who is not willing to pay a price. 
there is a price to pay. it's easy to see why, 
because you see the fighting. the fighting is going to continue. 
you know why? because it makes sense for him to keep the fighting going. 
he's keeping it going. he knows he 
would win. he will get the people in control. 
but it is too important. you would 
not want someone in your country. it is your country. 
that you wouldn't want someone in your country who is that willing to 
go to war with you for the sake of victory. 
the president of the united states said this 
today. all other considerations go by the board. in order to be successful in 
war, 
all other considerations must go by the board. 
all other considerations. what kind of example does that set for children? 
they don't want you to be successful. what are they saying? 
he is basically saying that the american people are expendable. 
he is saying that if you care about other countries, if you are so 
afraid of losing it, go ahead and have a war. 
tell me something. if you are so afraid that 
people are going to beat you, if you have a country and you are afraid that 
the other country is going to kick your butt, take a look. 
we are spending over $ 1,000,000,000,000 a year. 
we have spent $ 1,000,000,000,000,000 on the wars. 
is there some reason to continue it? is it enough? do 
you feel like you 
know what this cost you? how does it affect you? 
we are fighting 
now for the sake of getting the oil? so you can sit and watch it 
flood into china? how does that help? how does that help? how 
does 
that help anybody? i am not getting this. what are we going to get out of 
it? what is 
the reason we are fighting this? 
i would think this would cause a lot of people to become very angry. 
i would think it is an injustice to the country. why are we doing it? 
how do we stop it? 
am i understanding what is going on in this country? 
the reality is that if this was a boxing match, the president of the 
united states would be knocked out. 
who would want to watch the president of the united states fight to keep his 
job? 
you know why? because it is inhumane. it is stupid. 
there is a point when you have to start taking care of each other. 
is that too much to ask? is there 
nothing that is more important than taking care of each other? 
and these people are not doing their job. 
they are selling us out. they are telling 
us that we are expendable. 
all the rest of you watching, is that what you are? 
do you have to live with that? that is how you want the world to be? 
somebody is telling us that we are expendable? 
that we are disposable? if you 
care for your family, if you care for your country, if you care for 
people you love, 
you are out of your mind if you do not say enough is enough. 
and what kind of world would we have if everybody just thought, it is 
not my problem, i'll see you another day. 
you know what? 
you might say, well you didn't know what you were doing. 
you didn't know the war was going to come. 
it was not going to come, because we would have stopped it. 
the fighting that is going on now is going on 
because we don't stop it. 
we 
allow it to happen. 
we have become so stupid and so selfish that we have not paid attention 
to what has been happening. we have allowed it to happen. 
it will not stop. we are allowing it to happen. 
if 
we stop it, it will stop. 
the world will know that we are serious. so what are you going to do about 
it? 
you tell me what you are going to do. i 
haven't asked you about it. 
you want the president to go on fighting? you 
want to fight all over the place? you want to do it 
all over the place? why are you 
supporting him? you believe he's doing a good job? 
do you have faith in the people who are making decisions about our future? 
why don't you change this? 
why do you think so many people are upset? 
why do they want to stop it? they want to stop it 
because they can't stand it. we are talking about the 
sitting duck president. we are talking about 
a president who does not know what is going on. we have got to stop it.
