His only option was to defeat the demonic horde once and for all and be the most powerful of the Nithian warriors once again.

And with that, the battle was on.

The Nithian warriors charged into the fray with their blades held high, and the demons cowered. Quiggly charged into the battle, his sword swinging in a great arc, and sliced a demonic head from its shoulders. He then stabbed at another, causing it to crumble into a heap of bone and teeth.

The warriors worked as a team, with everyone's blades slashing into the demonic attackers. The demons roared and hissed as their blades struck hard. The Nithians fought harder, and they were all fearsome and grim.

Quiggly soon realized that they were a perfect team, and they fought with a combined spirit and an unbelievable sense of strength. He knew that he wouldn't be beaten as long as they fought together. But how could they do it? How could they be strong enough to defeat a band of demons on their own?

Quiggly couldn't move. His blood coursed with anxiety as he realized that their lives depended on their teamwork. He was suddenly overwhelmed by emotions as he realized that if they failed to kill the demons, they would die as well. The fear was immense as he watched the demons slowly advance upon them.

"We have no choice!" Quiggly shouted. "We must work as a team!"

"What do we do?" asked a warrior.

"We attack!" Quiggly said. "We have no other choice!"

As the warriors attacked, they were able to fend off most of the demons, which only made the task even more challenging.

"We must take them out one at a time!" Quiggly yelled as he slashed at a demon with his sword. "It's our only hope!"

They were all battered and bruised as they fought to defeat their foes. Every one of them was desperately clinging to life.

The demons kept stepping in with their swords as they attacked. The Nithians were outnumbered and exhausted, and they were all growing weary.

"Don't die!" Quiggly shouted. "Never die on a battlefield!"

But the demons were now attacking with such ease that their only chance of survival was to be killed.

Quiggly found himself surrounded by a group of demons as he was pelted with arrows. He parried each one as he slashed at the demons and fought to break free.

"We have to break out of this!" he screamed. "We have to break out of here!"

The demons were all around him. He knew that they were trying to kill him, and that they had defeated all the Nithians, so there was nothing that he could do. He knew that they were going to die, but he wouldn't give up.

"No!" Quiggly yelled. "Don't die like this! Fight!"

As the demons started to press in for the kill, the warriors attacked and slashed their blades, as the demons tried to break through. They could barely withstand the assault, but they would not die without fighting.

Quiggly felt like he was sinking into the dirt as he lay slumped over and fighting for his life. He knew that there was no hope for him, and then all hope was lost. He had never felt such horrible despair as he lay gasping for air. Then, all was quiet again. The demons had left, but Quiggly wasn't expecting to survive.

Quiggly was stunned by what had happened, and the blood rushed to his head as he felt his world spinning around. He was weak and disoriented, but a warrior immediately grabbed him and carried him over to some shade.

"Quiggly!" Eustas said. "Eustas! I'm sorry, it was my fault. It's all my fault. I did what you told me to do, but you were right. He saved you."

Quiggly was weak and barely able to move. His body trembled with cold and fear, and he couldn't answer. He was just glad that he could still hear.

"He saved us all, Quiggly," Eustas said. "He saved all of us. He held the demons back, and the war between the Nithians and the demons is now over."

The Nithian warriors celebrated as they looked upon the carnage they had left behind. The battlefield was littered with the carcasses of their enemies, and the skies above them glistened in the sun. The air was fresh and fresh breezes carried the smell of spring into the lands, which made the warriors smile and glow with confidence. They felt like the great warriors that they were and felt their strength grow.

"Yes!" said Jasher. "Our war is over. My war was to protect our home, and now it's time for me to return home and to face my friends. And that's exactly what I am going to do, for I am going home."

The warriors gazed up at the sun, and it warmed their faces.

"And that's when Quiggly's eyes went blurry and he slumped over."

"I will keep all of you safe, the Nithians, for I am your guardian," Quiggly said. "I will watch over you. There is only a part of me that remains that is still a demon, for I am a hybrid, which makes me different, but it doesn't mean I am evil. My family and friends must watch over me, and I will find my way back to my human self."

"Quiggly!" Yrona exclaimed. "You're alive!"

"Everyone, I must warn you all. I have seen that you don't know what a hybrid is. You are all warriors, but I know that you are all afraid, so I will show you."

The warriors stood up tall and strong as they watched Quiggly. He stood with his chest puffed out, and his posture was unwavering.

"Quiggly, what is it?" Yrona said.

"I must tell you all that I am a warrior. I am a member of the Nithians and a new Nithian warrior."

The Nithian warriors were speechless as Quiggly tried to break their stupor. They didn't know what to make of his declaration, and they just stood there staring blankly.

"Nithians!" Quiggly shouted. "I am a Nithian warrior."

The warriors stared at Quiggly as he turned red with embarrassment.

"What is wrong with you?" Jasher said. "What are you talking about?"

"What I am saying is true, and you have to accept it. I know that I am a warrior, and you should all know that I am a warrior. I am a warrior who is trapped in a body, a body that is still evil, even though I am not a demon. I know that I am still a warrior because I fought alongside warriors and felt their strength."

"Quiggly, you are a good man, a great man," Eustas said. "I should know, because I have known you since I was a little boy. And I can tell you now that you will never be evil, because you were born pure, and you were a part of us and of our tribe. You are also a part of our families, and we love you. We should have never doubted you."

Quiggly smiled as he leaned over the ground and embraced Eustas.

"Don't worry, we still have a home, for we are a part of the Nithians, and that has not changed," Quiggly said. "And now, the journey is only beginning. Now I have a new duty as a Nithian warrior, and I will do my best to protect my tribe and become the best warrior they could ever wish for."

"Quiggly!" Yrona said. "Your words are so beautiful."

The warriors continued to stare in amazement as Quiggly stood strong and proud.

"Quiggly, who are you?" Yrona said. "What is happening to you?!"

"Quiggly," Eustas said. "This is not you. It is a demon's body. Now, be like me, and become a good warrior. Don't ever let any demon possess you."

The warriors began to cheer as Quiggly stood with a sense of peace.

"This is it, for I have sworn to protect my people, just as I did before," Quiggly said.

"Quiggly," Jasher said. "You are a warrior. You are the best warrior on this planet, and that is never going to change."

"You are our leader and the first warrior to defend us against the demons, and you will be the first warrior to join us when we have fought our first battle and overcome our fears," Quiggly said. "For you, our warriors, are our family, and we are the family of the Nithians."

With Quiggly's declaration, the Nithian warriors charged into</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:13
