enlarge the existing plants, which means we should be able to 
increase the capacity by as much as an additional 100 MW of power 
which will equal the amount of electricity needed to supply 40,000 
homes.  We're extremely pleased.

FPL has been in the power business for more than five decades.  During 
that time, we've proven ourselves to be a responsible corporate citizen 
while embracing the challenges of deregulating the utility market.  We 
followed the rules, became involved in the Public Utilities Commission 
proceedings, and then contributed to a balanced solution to ensure 
just and reasonable electric rates in Florida.  This year, we were even 
selected to receive the J. D. McFeeley Award which honors those who have 
excelled in the utility business.

Our vision of becoming the best energy company in America hasn't changed.  
But our definition of what it means to be the best has.

As a not-for-profit organization, we're dedicated to fulfilling our 
mission of providing outstanding customer service as well as creating 
mutual value for Florida's environment, consumers, employees, and 
communities.  In order to succeed in today's markets, we must also look 
ahead and anticipate where the deregulated market is going.  Toward this 
end, FPL Group is reviewing its business strategy to position FPL Energy 
Group for the continued challenges and opportunities in the years ahead.  
We expect to announce changes in the organization soon.  At the same time 
we will be looking for talented individuals to join us in those efforts.

With all of our challenges and opportunities, we also recognize that it's 
going to be very difficult to make all of our plans.  So we have embarked 
on a strategic plan to build a foundation that ensures the organization 
will meet the demands of tomorrow.  We're working as a team, and our plan 
is to lay a solid foundation for success to allow FPL Energy Group to 
continue to deliver on our promise of reliable, competitively priced 
service. 
We expect to make changes across our organization which are necessary to 
create this foundation and ensure that we're a company that takes 
responsibility for our actions. 

Because this is such an important part of our overall business plan, I'm 
asking you to work with me to shape our strategic direction for the future. 
If you are interested in this opportunity, please send your resume to 
Beth Gaines, Vice President - Human Resources. Beth has coordinated all 
staffing for the commercial business units in the past and is responsible 
for staffing plans for FPL Energy Group. She can be reached at (850) 
223-6499 or bgaines@fpl.com.

Thank you in advance for your time and attention. I hope to meet each of 
you in the future. In the meantime, please join us in a common mission 
and purpose to provide exceptional service, to become the best energy 
company in America, and to deliver reliable power to our customers.

Sincerely,
Joseph F. Harrington, Jr.
President and Chief Executive Officer
FPL Energy, a Division of the  Florida Power & Light Company
