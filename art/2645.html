Custom Colored Solitaire Engagement Rings

Add gold, silver, or platinum around your center stone for that extra pop of color. You can even choose the length and width of the band to match. Custom rings can be made in any shape and size imaginable.

How do we make a Custom Colored Solitaire Engagement Ring?

We utilize a number of methods to obtain the result that you’re looking for. Our technicians might take digital photos or digital impressions of your existing engagement ring and use that to create a mockup. This mockup is also a way for you to see what you may be missing out on without committing to anything.

You can browse through our selection of engagement rings in the comfort of your home, and even order a free digital mockup for your own personal use. It’s a great way to get the feeling of an engagement ring without having to buy it.

When you are ready, we can then provide you with three possible options. You can upload the file of the custom colored solitaire you like and we will do the rest. If you’d like, you can also send us an email with your picture of the ring you would like us to customize. In some cases, all you have to do is call us. We’re here to help.

Ordered your ring, but need it sooner than the estimated time frame? Have no worries. We are pleased to offer next day shipping. And if you need your ring by a certain date, we can help. In some cases, we can have your ring ready the very next day.
