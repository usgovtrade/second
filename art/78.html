Instead  
of the old house and gardens,  
the first thing she saw, as she stepped  
out of the train at the small town's  
station, was an old, brick, single-story  
building with large plate-glass windows  
and red painted shutters, all framed  
by two dark columns. Inside, a woman  
stood behind a mahogany counter.  
The woman looked at her, with surprise,  
and said, "What have we here?"

It was one of those old-fashioned  
county fairs.  
The woman handed her a form. "I'll  
be right back," she said. "Bring me  
your driver's license."

This was absurd, but she smiled  
at the woman, the same smile she  
had smiled at hundreds, maybe  
thousands of other strange people  
who had asked for the same thing.  
She handed the woman her driver's  
license. The woman seemed to get a kick  
out of this and then she went to a

table behind her counter. There  
she collected a few more documents,  
as well as a few pennies, then she  
handed back the license.

"Here you go. Hope your trip was  
pleasant."

Her driver's license said  
"Marian Williams." She smiled.

"I'm going to take you to the police  
department now," the woman said. "They  
might have questions. It's not every day  
a girl with a driver's license in her  
possession comes in and asks for your  
driver's license."

In the police station, a tall, lanky  
man sat behind a desk. He smiled when  
he saw her. "You going to give me your  
driver's license, too?" he asked. "In that  
case I'll have to look it up on the system."

But they didn't need the system.  
They didn't have to look anything  
up.

He looked over her license and his  
eyes got real big, "How old are you?" he  
asked.

"Thirteen," she said.

"Humph," he said. "Then you don't  
look thirteen. How old are you really?"

"Nine," she said.

He said, "Don't tell me this whole  
thing is a joke. You must be  
thirteen years old."

"Nine," she said.

"Nine. Well, you must have thought  
you were playing a game," he said.

She sat in the police station,  
waiting for an hour, but no one  
came for her. Eventually, she got up  
and went out of the police station.

Then, back in the station, she asked,  
"Is this thing still going?"

The cop looked down at her  
driver's license, shook his head,  
"It looks like it's expired. If you want  
to drive, I'll have to suspend your  
license."

"What if I come back and try  
again? What if I get it again?"

"Sorry," the cop said. "You can try.  
There's a test you'll have to take. You  
pass that and I'll give you your license  
back. Until then, no license."

But she didn't want to take the test  
unless she had to.  
She never did.

At the same table as the man  
behind the desk was a middle-aged  
woman with a badge and a gun.  
"What's your name?" the woman asked.

"Marian Williams."

"Why did you ask for your  
driver's license?"

"I'm going to drive now," she said.

"I'm glad to hear it. But I'm going to  
take you to a DMV office to have  
your driving test."

"I don't have to take the test.  
I'm old enough."

"I'm sorry, honey," the woman said.

"How old are you?"

"I don't know. I don't know how old  
I am. I've always been here. I've  
just always been here."

"I know what you mean. There's  
something like that about my father.  
He was here for more than thirty years,  
at the same table, at this desk, never  
wanted to leave, until he died.  
They say the old people go to heaven."

The woman looked at her  
with kind eyes. "Have you ever had  
people you don't know come up to you  
asking for your license?"

"Yes, once."

"Did you give them your license?"

"No."

"You must have had good luck."

"Yes, I guess so."

"I'll be right back," she said. "I'm going  
to go get you your test papers."

She went behind the counter and got  
her test papers and then she returned,  
walked to the back, where the woman  
sat behind a desk, and put them in  
front of her.

"Have you ever had your license  
suspended?"

"Yes."

"Do you want to do it again?"

"Yes."

"Well, you're going to. You're going to  
take this test and I'm going to give  
you your license back, but you're going  
to make sure, when you get it,  
that the clerk writes 'suspended'  
on the front of your license."

"What's on the back of my license?"

"You ask me, why don't you read it  
yourself?"

"No, I want to know what's on  
the back of it, please. "

"Just say your mother's maiden  
name."

"Don't tell me, that's what you want  
me to say."

The woman smiled. "Well, honey, I  
guess we won't need to know your  
mother's maiden name, will we? Just tell  
us what's on the back of your license."

The woman handed her a few more  
papers, a form. "Now, there's a fine for  
not having your license," she said. "It  
can be as much as a thousand dollars.  
We'd like to collect it, if we can."

"I don't have a thousand dollars,"  
she said.

"Don't worry about it," she said. "Don't  
be afraid to ask. When you come to  
the part where they ask you to write  
your license number and the date,  
put it down just like it's written on  
the back of your license. I'll write  
down the number for you."

In the DMV office, she started to  
ask if it was okay to write down  
the license number. But before she  
could get the words out of her mouth  
the clerk wrote the number on the  
form.

Marian watched, as she watched  
people come in, sit down, and write  
down their license numbers.  
All the while she waited, she kept  
thinking about what to do with the  
license. What could she do with it?  
Keep it with her? Leave it in the  
window of her car? Drive to the next  
town and lose it?

At the DMV office, she had been  
given a big piece of paper and some  
pens. "Make sure you write your name  
under the number you just wrote,"  
the clerk told her.

"That's easy," she said, and started  
writing.

In the police station, the cop was  
looking at the papers the woman  
had given her. "It says 'Marian  
Williams' on the back of your license,"  
he said.

"I know," she said.

He nodded. "This is your first test,  
right?"

"Yes."

"And it says, 'suspended.'"

"It does."

"If you get it wrong,  
and you'll get it wrong, I'm going  
to give you a thousand dollars.

"Is it all right if I write down my  
license number now?"

He nodded. "Sure. Just make sure you  
write down the number you just wrote  
on the form."

When she got home that night, she  
went into the kitchen, got a pencil,  
and wrote the number on the back of  
her license.

The next day, she tried again. When  
she went to the counter she told the  
woman behind the counter what she  
was going to do.

"I know it's hard for you to say  
this, honey, but you'll have to say,  
'My mother's maiden name is Mary  
Barker.'

She wrote down the license number,  
then she wrote her mother's name and  
her mother's maiden name on the  
form. Then she wrote the driver's  
license number on the back of her  
license.

The woman behind the counter  
looked at her with sad eyes.  
"This is going to be very difficult  
for you, honey."

"I don't think it will be."

"I know. But it's going to be  
very hard for you, especially  
with this cop sitting behind me  
looking over my shoulder. It's going  
to make me nervous to have to look  
him in the eye."

"Why don't you look  
him in the eye?"

"He's not looking at me. I know  
he's not looking at me."

"But he's looking  
at me.

"I'm so sorry," she said. "I  
mean, I'm so sorry."

"What are you sorry  
about?"

"I'm sorry it's so hard."

"What's so hard about it?"

"This cop's just like a  
child. He's going to keep  
saying, 'Don't do it. Don't do it.'"

"Well, it's not  
going to be hard for him,  
is it?"

"Yes, it is,  
because he's always  
sitting behind a desk  
and I'm behind a counter,  
and we're the only two people  
here. It's like being in a  
movie and just watching myself."

The woman behind the counter  
looked at her with kind eyes.  
"Well, honey, it is hard. But  
we're going to try. We're going to try  
real hard."

She smiled. "You are so  
kind. Thank you."

They sat at her kitchen table,  
the woman behind the counter  
and she, and they talked for a long  
time. They talked about life,  
and children, and marriage, and about  
the woman who had come to the DMV  
in Virginia, and had been taken  
away.

At the end of the conversation,  
the woman behind the counter  
handed her a stack of her test papers,  
a stack that was as tall as Marian's  
shoulders.

In the kitchen, she stood at the sink  
and opened one of the top windows  
and started to pour the sink out onto  
the grass and weeds.

"Are you sure this is the  
way you want it?" she asked.

The woman just stood and stared.

"This is what I'm going to do."

She held the paper in the sink and  
poured it out.

The woman behind the counter just  
stood and stared. Then she got up  
and walked toward the sink and  
peeked inside the paper.

"Will it do?"

"Oh yes."

"Will it all do?"

"We'll find out, won't we?"

The woman turned and walked to  
her car, and when she got in  
she started the engine, and headed  
down the road.

The road led to where the road  
begins to wind. At first, the road  
is a long one, and the houses are far  
apart. But as the road starts to twist  
and twist, the houses get closer  
and closer together.

Marian took the license back to her  
car and put it under her seat, where  
no one could see it. Then she drove to  
the school, and parked, and took out  
all her stuff and put it into her suitcase.

Then she got back in the car and  
turned on the radio. A song came on  
and for a little while she listened  
to the song, then turned the radio  
off. She looked at the paper  
in the sink and she shook her head.

She walked back to the car and  
she got in and sat in the car, not moving,  
while she let the tears come.

By the time she went back to her  
room, the sky was getting  
dark. Her mother was  
watching television.

"I'm going out,"  
she said.

"Where?"

"Just out."

"Where are you going  
to go?"

"I'm going to a place  
I went to when I was  
younger."

"Where?"

"It's a place  
on the other side  
of town."

"Are you going to stay  
there tonight?"

"No. Not  
all night."

She got her coat.

"I have to do  
something."

"Something  
about your license?"

"No."

"About the cop?"

"No."

"Then why are you  
going out?

"I have to."

"What if you go  
out and someone  
recognizes you?"

"They'll be able  
to recognize me."

"Marian!"

"I'm  
okay,  
mother."

She went to her purse  
and took out her gun. She loaded  
a bullet into it and then she  
slipped it into the side of  
her belt.

The woman on TV  
was wearing her glasses  
and she was talking to a woman  
who had a long yellow-  
gray bun on her head.

"Do  
you know?"  
the woman on TV asked.

"No,"  
the woman with the  
bun said.

Marian sat in her room, watching  
the old people on television. She  
could see them in her mind,  
and she could see her own face.

On the television, they were having  
fun and she could have fun, too.

She pulled out her gun and  
she put it to her head, and then she  
pulled it away and left it to herself,  
left it in her pillow, like she did  
when she was little, and was going to  
go and take a bath, and go down to her  
room, and sit in her room and think.

Then she stood up and picked up  
her suitcase and took it to the  
door. She looked in the  
window and she could see  
her mother sitting on the couch,  
staring at the television, and  
Marian opened the door, and  
walked out.

The End of the World  
as You Know It

When Marian had been gone for  
a little while, the woman came in  
and opened the door, and turned on the  
lights. Then she turned and looked at  
her mother.

"Come look at this."

"What?"

"Look at this."

Her mother went into her room, and  
Marian came to the door, and then  
she walked into the kitchen.

"Look at this."

The woman was sitting at the table.  
She had a sheet of paper in her lap,  
and she was pointing to an area  
of the paper.

"What's that?"

"Come look at this."

"What is it?"

"It's a drawing</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:05
