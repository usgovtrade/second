The Perfect Murder"The Perfect Murder"

Three teams - (Solo, J, and Cee-C) are left aboard a crashed airplane. As they scavenge for supplies, one of them finds a small hole at the base of the wing. Through the hole, she sees a box. The box has a tag reading, "Property of W.C. Grayson." One of the teams - Solo - steals the box and takes it to the other teams. They all start trying to figure out what to do with it. But, they are constantly being attacked by a group of mercenaries called The Reapers. Finally, J says to Cee-C, "This will show 'em. We have to trust each other. And, when it's all over, maybe we'll get out of this mess and have one hell of a wild time." After reading the letters to them, it is a sign from Jesus that they should kill the man in the box. J opens the box and sees the man is dead. In anger, they tear the man to pieces, skinning him. They then place his body parts in a black bag with a bag of red liquid inside. Then, one by one, they throw it down a ravine where it is never found. When a bunch of new people show up looking for this man, none of the survivors speak up.

Two teams - (Al, A-1, and B-1) are left alone on a tropical island. In an attempt to help each other, they make a raft. As they move to a small island to look for fruit and a place to build a house, a group of four people show up with a man on a stretcher. They inform Al that there is a man on a stretcher over there in an area being quarantined. Al shows them the man and asks what is wrong with him, but they say they do not know. One of them suggests that if he has any food, he would show it because he would not be able to show his face in public because of what happened. A-1 says they should get rid of him because he may cause some more bad publicity. As they make their way to a stream to fill their water containers, the man with the stretcher throws a radio. The person carrying him says that he found it. They then proceed to a shack on the edge of the jungle, saying the man must have been delirious and threw the radio while trying to escape. As the three begin their journey home, the stretcher holder says that Al should not have let them go. One of the men in the group says he will continue to carry the man back so that they will have witnesses. The stretcher holder says he will not have anyone believe him so he tries to run off. The man grabs the stretcher but ends up falling over. He then gets up and takes off. As they look out for the stretcher holder, they see it lying on the ground.

They try to climb a ladder, but a second dog charges at them and they are afraid they will not be able to get back out of the way.

The second team says that they were lost and looking for help when they found the door. The team in the cave says that they found a door in the wall of the mountain and the second team kept on climbing, but they did not.

Team B-1 is the last team left standing and they are still in Africa. A group of people come and inform B-1 that their team got separated from each other. They start walking and find a group of other survivors. As they walk by, the other survivors do not stop walking. Some of them are covered in dirt and one of them has a hole in his belly. Team B-1 wonders if these people are also the ones that killed their leader (Curt). A woman tells the men that they need to get their leader back to Africa because the other survivors are cannibals and are trying to kill anyone that is left. When they get back to the first team, B-1 gives their leader the bad news. He thanks them for the effort and says that he knows he must have made some mistakes in his life. He then tells his men that he needs to get this mission done. The leader says that since he has a radio, he must have been in communications with the people that took him. The leader says that they might have been his bosses and tells his men to try to find another way to get him out of the country. The leader is put in handcuffs and pushed into a wagon along with a dead man. The last survivor is still alive and he is the leader. The leader tells them that his last request is to eat the dead body. Written by Tim Myers.Directed by Chris Ryan, Jr.

While she is cooking, they ask about the dead man that she said was buried. The woman says he was a cannibal. They say that they don't want to hurt her, but she has a broken jaw, so they will be eating her. They order her to put her hands behind her head and tie her up. While tying her up, she says that she was also once part of a cannibal's team that killed many of them. When she finishes tying up the women, she starts to scream.
