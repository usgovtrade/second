In addition to the alleged sexual harassment and abuse, one of the women claims that her team was also underpaid for their work.

“I am suing Netflix for exploiting my DREAM of working in film and television by categorically refusing to pay me the wages I’ve earned as a member of the Writers Guild of America,” the lawsuit read. “I have received less than 1% of the amount I am owed for each episode of the series, and I do not know how much more I will earn from future seasons.”

The second woman added:

“Netflix is fully aware that they underpay their female employees, and we will fight back in court until we get what we deserve. Our stories will be heard. And we will not be erased,” a third woman claimed.

Like with past wage-theft claims against the company, the women are looking for a judge to certify their cases as class-action suits.

The third woman claims that she had two projects with the company that were not released. The first was about black people who had superpowers from the 1920s, and the second was a family sitcom.

The second woman said that the Netflix employees who harassed her have had “long rap sheets of their own,” and the first woman added:

It will never change until women get our stories out there in the open. But if they do come for me I will not go down alone. I will not be erased.

Both of the women were asked about the claims made by the men — “I have no idea what that is, but there are very few female executives in that capacity [at Netflix],” the first woman said. The second woman said that this was not true.

“There are tons of women with a high amount of creative power at Netflix,” she said. “They’re just not in the director or showrunner or executive of origin or writer roles.”

Milano later tweeted a retweet from another actress, Alyssa Milano, who said:

“There are plenty of us out here. Don’t worry, we will come for you too.”

“@Alyssa_Milano we are coming,” one woman responded. “Women of color and women of any age are not scared of bullies, not even a giant corporation. We are here. And we’re not going anywhere. We have a lot to say.”

“#Metoo” is a common phrase used by women who have been sexually harassed or abused, the name being a reference to the all-encompassing French film “The Metamorphosis.”

“The #MeToo movement has swept Hollywood in a way we haven’t seen since the days of Anita Hill’s testimony against Clarence Thomas in 1991,” wrote Vox.

“The recent string of high-profile sexual harassment and assault allegations have brought many similar incidents to light. In October, The New York Times published an article describing Hollywood’s problem with sexual harassment in detail, while women who worked in Hollywood and the industry’s power players were the target of sexual misconduct allegations by The New Yorker, a New York Times report, and The Los Angeles Times,” the article continues.

In October, Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos accused a private investigator hired by his wife of hacking into his phone and leaking a “smear campaign” about himself.

In June 2018, BuzzFeed published an article listing 20 women who said they were sexually assaulted by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. In October of that year, Weinstein was found dead in his hotel room. Weinstein was also accused of raping a woman and physically attacking her friend.

In the weeks following the Weinstein scandal, “more than 140 Hollywood executives, agents, assistants and employees were fired or suspended because of their actions against the hundreds of victims speaking out,” the Hollywood Reporter reported.

The Hollywood Reporter, like many other news organizations, has faced criticism for failing to do more about allegations made against Weinstein. A month after the Weinstein exposé, Vox criticized The Hollywood Reporter for failing to disclose that they were owned by AT&T, one of Hollywood’s most politically liberal companies.

The Hollywood Reporter has also come under fire for “a pattern of questionable and misleading reporting,” including a story that listed the names of dozens of people who were accused of sexual misconduct. “Several of those individuals were wrongly named, and others were not accused of misconduct at all. In several cases, editors removed names without explanation or corrected them later,” The Hollywood Reporter said in their defense.

“We are in a crisis moment, not only in terms of who is leading, but also when it comes to who is keeping us safe, and we should be doing everything we can to be transparent and accountable,” said Michelle S. Gayer, one of the Weinstein accusers.
