Introduction to War Time Scrapbook and Its Table of Contents

The term "scrapbook" can be defined as an assemblage of items accumulated and arranged according to some overriding theme. Typically, this theme may be a personal one such as an individual's family history, a school history, a sports team's performances and many other types of collections. The collected items may be of two broad classes, those which are primary sources and those which are secondary sources. _Primary sources_ include, for example, family letters and photographs, newspaper clippings and other printed or unpublished documents. These items have not been created for the purpose of writing history, and therefore they do not have a predetermined purpose as history. _Secondary sources_ , on the other hand, are intended as aids to authors engaged in writing history. They include dictionaries, encyclopedias, bibliographies, bibliographies of periodicals and published reference books.

The scrapbook in which the present book will be compiled consists of both primary and secondary sources. It will include official documents such as war declarations, speeches by state leaders, resolutions by national organizations and newspaper stories as well as books, photographs, postcards, letters and other memorabilia. Of course, there will be a predominance of official documents because, as has been said, the scrapbook is designed to illustrate official events. Since the scrapbook in this collection is devoted primarily to the events of World War I, the photographs and postcards will consist mainly of views of Paris in a very few months after the outbreak of war in August 1914. Almost all the items used in the scrapbook will be published sources, but it should be noted that many other sources were available when this book was first published in 1939. To name just a few of these sources:

1. World War I veterans' memoirs

2. Personal letters and diaries from soldiers and civilians

3. Books and articles on World War I

4. Newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other newspapers

5. Photographs and other photographs

6. Personal letters and family papers

7. Theses and dissertations

8. Official reports, reports and official publications

9. Other official sources

When the World War I centennial came around in the late 1940s, the scrapbook included here became of greater interest to students of World War I. In many ways, this book has been expanded to include many additional items, from other sources as well as from those available earlier in 1939. The title of the book has been changed from "The World War One Story" to "War Time Scrapbook" and all the entries are arranged alphabetically in addition to the original arrangement by major countries and the names of political leaders. Also, the references and bibliographies have been made much fuller than before. The arrangement of the entries will be as follows:
