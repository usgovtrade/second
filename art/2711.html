We've also said from the start that we want to have an impact on the music industry and beyond, and we're starting with an area that has both a critical mass and is an industry unto itself - the video game industry. More and more music is being used in games to enhance the experience and a large percentage of that music is licensed, not commissioned, meaning that the labels are taking a small percentage of the profit, if there is a profit.

"Some licensing agents are claiming to be “agents for hire”, implying that they are acting on behalf of record labels and representing the labels’ interests, but in fact this activity damages the interests of the record labels, because labels are not “in-house” agents who get to profit from any licensing they secure. Many record labels contract with licensing agencies but they do not instruct the agencies to make a financial interest in such matters because the record labels take the music industry as a whole to court if a licensing agent makes a profit in an infringement matter. They do not want to risk alienating the whole music industry by their licensing agency’s financial interest in such matters.

The other problem is that artists and publishers are typically not informed of who the "agents for hire" are that licenses their music, so how does the “agent for hire” make sure that the artist and the publisher are not going to object to their licensing activity. Many artists and publishers do not even know that some of their music is being licensed for use in video games. In other words, “agent for hire” is a thinly disguised ploy for copyright infringement, often designed to mislead artists and publishers into believing that an “agent” will safeguard their interests.

In contrast, music publishers, artists and songwriters often employ their own licensing agents, which are independent contractors of their choosing, and they are advised that they may not make a financial interest in licensing their music and may only license music in an agency capacity. The “agents for hire” issue arose recently in a federal case in New York which involved a licensing agent and publisher which was using another person’s music, which led the label to assert copyright and trademark rights against the licensing agent as an “agent for hire.”

There is nothing “for hire” about any of this.”

In fact, what happens is that labels license music without paying royalties to artists and songwriters, but instead pay money to the people that claim to represent them, but they are actually representing the rights of music publishers and record labels that exploit artists’ work without paying royalties to those artists.

The best way to get your music out there is to get someone you trust to obtain a license on your behalf with a royalty agreement so you can make a reasonable living. You can license your work yourself if you want, but you have to be aware of how to do that, and be aware of the fact that you will be giving away your rights and paying a lot of money to people you may not know as well as people who have a motive to steal your music and make a lot of money.

We've been told by a number of music publishers that we may be the only licensing agency around that represents artists fairly. We want to work on a royalty basis because that means we can't afford to lose the music industry's business. They'll have an incentive to return to us in the future.

"I am sure you can guess that the music community is eager to understand your activities and see that you are working in their interests. So, when we tell them that you are licensing hundreds of thousands of video games and you're doing well for yourself and the rights holders, they understand."

We wanted to change things with our first venture in video game licensing. We don't expect to turn a profit on this venture, but we would love to change the dynamics of the music industry and make video games more like the old record industry, where records were promoted at radio and promoted in the music industry journals like "Billboard," and were seen as a medium for music.

We have heard from a number of publishing companies that they appreciate our work and we want to represent your work in the best way possible, especially if you're having problems licensing your music in a fair fashion.

To accomplish our goal, we are offering you the option to license your music ourselves through us. The following are licensing services that we are offering:

-We can license all of your catalog of musical works for video games that are owned by Activision Inc., Electronic Arts Inc., and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. for all types of commercial uses, including film, television, multimedia and internet. Please contact us for information on all of your existing licensing opportunities with Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Bros. Records, Universal Music Group, EMI Music Publishing, and others. We can license through us all the songs in your catalog of music that is owned by Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Bros. Records, and Universal Music Group in the Sony Music Entertainment Catalog and Warner Bros. Catalog. We can represent the music of more than 4,000 artists worldwide including KISS, SINATRA, THE BEATLES, MARLEY, THE ROLLING STONES, MADONNA, STING, and DYLAN, to name a few. We represent The Beatles, KISS, ELO, DURAN DURAN, The Rolling Stones, Sting and The Doors, and many more musical groups worldwide. We represent many major record labels and publishers around the world. We represent more than 3,000 music publishers worldwide.

-We can also license your other catalog of music through us for TV, motion picture, internet and multimedia use. Please contact us for information on the types of music available for this type of licensing and for more information on our music library.

-For our song licensing activities, we will pay a flat fee of $15 per album or per period of one year, whichever is less, in connection with all of your musical compositions. We will also pay you the same fee if we license your compositions by single rather than album. Our fees do not include any recording expenses. These payments are payable at the time we license your compositions.

-We will also pay royalties to the recording artist on a record label up to the statutory maximum in the United States (which are currently $ 0.125 per play for record sound recordings, $ 0.77 per play for non-interactive webcast sound recordings, and $ 0.44 per play for interactive webcast sound recordings) and to the publisher (which are currently $ 0.10 per page for printed music in books, magazines, etc. and $ 1.25 per page for printed music in newspapers, magazines, etc.) and to you as author of the musical work for all of the world’s copyrightable elements in the musical work. You will receive a percentage of our licensing fee. In addition, we will pay you royalties on additional elements in our agreements, such as our new arrangement fees, synchronization fees, etc. We will pay you 50% of the fees paid to us under our arrangements with a publisher.

-We are willing to license music which is currently "in-use" on television or motion pictures and other forms of entertainment.

We also offer a unique service to you that is beneficial to you, if you are not already working with a licensing agent. We are willing to license all of your music through us for the lowest fees, and for the best royalty rates for your music which currently are as follows:

-You will receive 70% of our licensing fee if we agree to represent your music in all of the territories in the U.S.

-We can represent you in foreign countries around the world, including the USA, Europe, Canada, the Middle East, and Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. You will receive a royalty from our license. You will receive 70% of our license fee.

- You may be able to receive royalties from our license if you license your music through us.

-You may be able to license your catalog to other parties and receive royalties from us, if you license your music through us.

These rates are for music from both the "Sony Music Catalog" and the "Warner Bros. Catalog" that is owned by Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Bros. Records, and Universal Music Group. You can obtain a copy of the "Warner Bros. Catalog" from Sony Music Entertainment and/or you can visit our website at http://www.robertbradleymusic.com/ and click on the link at the bottom of the page to find out how we can help you license your music through us.

Here is a sample of our license agreement. This agreement is only valid for music owned by Sony Music Entertainment.

We are committed to licensing your music for use in every platform you choose, either directly or through us. We will be able to accommodate any platform you choose and ensure that all of your music is licensed fairly, and that it receives appropriate royalty rates.

It is our goal that the publishing companies and recording companies that make up the two major record labels will license their artists’ music to companies such as our company, so we can represent those artists fairly, using our music to promote a whole new industry in the music industry.

Some of the artists have already agreed to license their music through us, and we already have had some success licensing music. Some of them have already licensed their catalog for video games to people who license their songs with you now, and some</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:56
