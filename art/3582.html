Games that have a “Tower Defense” style, e.g. Plants vs. Zombies, League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, or Dota 2

Games that have a more “rougelike” style of gameplay, e.g. Castle Crashers, Risk of Rain, Dungeon Defenders, League of Legends, or Heroes of Newerth

So, a game is eligible to be on our site if it fits at least one of the following criteria:

It’s a game with a single player campaign

It’s an online only game

It has “endless” mode (or mode like “endless” where it never ends)

It has any kind of replay feature (achievement system, multiplayer, etc.)

It has an option for the game to automatically set up new accounts for you based on characters you’ve played before.

It has optional multiplayer that includes some kind of ranking system.

It has a multiplayer lobby, a match-making server, etc.

It has any kind of free-to-play business model.

It has some kind of optional, pay-to-play monetization model.

In general, the more unique the feature set of the game, the better. However, to be clear, you don’t need to come up with some new set of unique features to be eligible for our list of best browser games. For example, you could simply create a clone of a traditional, PC game and add something like Facebook integration, then be eligible for the list. If that’s all it took, I could make you a list of the best and worst games of all time as far as clone-style games go, and it would all make sense (and you would feel silly). The point is to find games that have unique features that set them apart.

I encourage you to try out as many games as you want and vote for your favorite. For most games, we recommend using your most recent browser, as it will more accurately show you what the game currently looks like. However, older versions of older browsers will work if it doesn’t currently work on your current browser. (Our browser game database only updates once a day, so some older browsers may still not be fully functional.)

Below is the current list. Please note that it is not final or complete — we will update this list as new games are added and/or our personal favorites rise in the rankings, and we will continue to update it in the future.

In addition to the ranking system mentioned above, I would like to give you an alternative way to see how similar/different two games are. First, this will only work on games that have ranking systems that show you in which of several categories your game is (e.g. “bronze” or “bronze+”, or “elite” or “elite+”). This is one of the easiest ways to compare games, so I hope that the games that have this sorting system will cover most games.

First, go to the current list of ranked games at GameRankings.com. Click on any game to go to the game’s page. Once you’re on the page for the game you want to compare, scroll down until you find the text that says something like “ranked #1” and note it down (you’ll need to scroll down, because the text you need will likely be longer than the text before or after it).

Then, go to the same page as above, but at GameRankings.com/add. Click on any game to go to its page. Then, scroll down until you find the same text as above (likely near the bottom of the page), and copy it. Go back to your computer.

Now, go back to the game list page at GameRankings.com, and scroll down until you find the game you want to compare, then scroll down a bit more. When you’re on the same page as above, but for the game you want to compare, look for the words “category:” followed by the first word of the text you copied from GameRankings.com/add.

For example, if you wanted to compare two games, one of which was ranked #1 in the “Bronze+” category and the other which was ranked #1 in the “Bronze” category, you would go to GameRankings.com and look for the text saying “#1 in “Bronze+” category”. Then scroll down until you found the second “+” in the text, and you would copy that text. You would then go back to your computer and click on the link GameRankings.com/add, look for the game you wanted to compare, go to GameRankings.com, and click on the game in question. At the top right of the page, you should see a text that says something like “#1 in “Bronze” category.” Click on the word “category” to highlight it, then use the mouse to highlight the “+” next to it. Right-click the highlighted text to copy it, and return to your computer. In your browser’s URL bar, type in GameRankings.com/?cat=0, followed by the text you copied. Note: You will likely need to hit the back arrow once if the site reloads automatically. Your new window should now show you the game you want to compare to the one you currently have open in your browser. You can repeat this process for as many games as you want to compare. Note: You will need to type in a new “?cat=0” when you want to go to the next game.

Now that you have a list of games you want to compare, you can simply go through them in order and click on the next one, or you can use the following sorting system.

Just click on the little down arrow to the right of each game, and in the list that comes up, use the drop-down menu next to “sort by” to determine your order, from 1 (the highest) to 20 (the lowest). You can see in this image below how using this simple sorting method can help to visualize some of the features discussed above. The yellow highlights the first game, and the red highlights the game that is second.

This method works even better if you apply the following colors to each game’s title bar and background: (1) Purple for single player games, (2) Blue for non-single player games, and (3) Green for free-to-play games. (Note: Games like FarmVille and the like would fall into a category we call “social games” and would not qualify for either of the color categories I’ve mentioned here. If you were comparing a single player game that did not use any kind of microtransactions, to a game with only a free-to-play monetization system, we would put the purple and blue ones on top of each other because of the social nature of the “social” game. If you wanted to compare these two categories to one another, you would need to do so manually.)

Now, while you will see differences between this list and the above one because of the way the two different systems work, this list should still be a great guide for finding games that other people have enjoyed and rated highly, and which contain some of the unique features that we are looking for. Please feel free to share your observations below if you notice any games that should be added. Feel free to correct any games we’ve missed, and help us to improve our ability to help you find great games.

Note: If you have trouble seeing certain characters, you can try copying the URL of the games (including the part after GameRankings.com/add) and pasting it into the address bar. This should work in newer versions of Firefox and Chrome, but not necessarily in older versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer. Also note that in older versions of Internet Explorer (i.e. IE8), you may not be able to use the arrow key to scroll up and down.

We encourage you to vote up your favorite games, try out games that you didn’t think you would like, or find games that you haven’t played yet. Please vote for as many games as you want. We have made it easy for you with the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:33
