Home Insurance: I’ve never actually had to go through the entire claims process for an insurance claim. I have a little personal experience here. It sucks and it sucks and it fucking sucks!

As a freelance content creator, I don’t have a company car and don’t have liability coverage. I just use Uber and Lyft when I need a ride. Some people do this for money or for pleasure or for both. I do this because I live in a tiny town in Missouri and don’t want to own a car that would get me into trouble when I’m pulled over for driving 10mph over the limit. It was an inconvenience when I did have a car, which was basically never. So, if you’re writing out a letter like this, see if you can go with “I’ve always been careful to obey the speed limits. I haven’t had an accident and don’t want one.” If you’re going to tell a fact, tell it like a fact.

I’ve gone through two car accidents in the past 8 years. One was entirely my fault, in which I was rear-ended in my own driveway. I got to keep the car I was driving because it was a good car, but the body shop took my van for some undisclosed amount and my insurance reimbursed me minus that amount, but it was more than it should have been, so fuck them. I had good insurance and made sure to follow all of their guidelines in the previous accidents, so there is no room for anything other than sympathy on this side of this negotiation.

One was my friend (a person who rides for a living) who got her neck broken by an idiot who was driving in a lane he shouldn’t have been driving in, in broad daylight. She was making a delivery for me the next day and was too hurt to work.

Now, if I’m reading that correctly, it seems that “I never had an accident or never got a ticket” would make an even better point. “I’ve done all the things that anyone could have done to be a careful driver,” is likely a bad choice. In that case, you’re saying that you’re an extremely safe driver. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it also just might not be relevant to your situation.

My advice would be to go straight to “I’ve had two accidents, and I’ve complied with every demand of my insurance company.”

It’s also important to not tell your insurance company things that they may be able to take out of context. For example, “I have a clean driving record, with no accidents or tickets” is not the same as saying you have no accidents or tickets. If they were to run a credit report on you or anything, they may learn something that contradicts your words.

Car Insurance: As stated, never tell them that you have never had an accident. They may deny you or your loved ones the appropriate compensation for a collision that they are aware of.

That being said, telling your insurance provider that you have never had an accident can be tricky, as some insurers use this information to determine your risk. An insurer can use this information to make assumptions regarding what type of driver you are or whether or not you are a high-risk driver. If they determine that you are a high-risk driver, your premium rates could be higher than those of other drivers with accident records. They may also deny you certain benefits or higher deductibles for some or all of your coverage. It’s important to keep in mind that being able to provide proof of how much you have paid for car insurance is also a valuable asset to show insurers. This information could make a difference in determining your risk factor.

Home Insurance: As a writer, I know nothing about home insurance, other than it has nothing to do with me.

I have never actually had to go through the claims process for an insurance claim. I have a little personal experience here. It sucks and it sucks and it fucking sucks! So, I feel I have a little room to talk here, but I don’t have any experience and have never written a claim. I recommend not putting “I’ve never had an accident or no-fault insurance claims” on your application. You should put “I’ve been fully compliant with all policies” or something like that. This means that you’ve been fully compliant with all policies, not only with their policy, but the state’s rules as well. State rules are more complicated and require annual paperwork to be filled out by the insurance company to make sure that you are staying in compliance with their expectations. This will make the insurance company more likely to be sympathetic to your claims, but it’s not as useful as you would imagine it to be.

However, if you are ever asked in an interview about something like this, it is a good thing to say. When I was in the Army, I was asked, “How are your driving record?” As an experienced motorcyclist and driver, I had no problems with my driver’s license and answered, “Well, it’s clean and clear.” I was asked to take the written test for my new job (which was a requirement) before my start date. I spent the entire next week with the test on my mind. I answered every question on the written test correctly with flying colors, getting my license without any incident and a promotion for my efforts.

Home Insurance: Here is some info about an interesting part of being an insurance consumer.

When you are buying home insurance or car insurance, you will be asked a series of questions, some which you will answer in your own words. Some of the answers will be used for background checks on you, some for determining what your risk profile is.

If you lie about some aspect of your life in this respect, even if you later rectify the lie (such as by telling the truth at your claims interview with your insurance company) or by correcting an error on a form (like a home purchase loan application that gives you a low credit score, and then you go and get a new credit card and apply for a home loan on the new card and immediately pay off the old card) then your claims history may be inaccurate, and can’t be “corrected” the same way. Once the insurance companies have you on the books as a driver who never has had a claim, they are going to stay on the books as a driver who never has had a claim. It’s how they operate. And it’s how they save money and get ahead of the market. They are trying to save money, not pay you claims. This doesn’t mean you are a bad driver (necessarily), only that you may be paying for more coverage than you need.

The end of your letter might be a lot shorter. It might go like this:

To Whom It May Concern:

I’ve been a customer of your company and I have a claim to report. I’ve never been ticketed, and I’ve never had an accident of any kind, ever. As far as my driving history goes, I’m a very safe and responsible driver. I know that is not always the case, but I’ve done all I can to ensure that I am being as safe as I possibly can.

Let me tell you a little bit about myself, I’m a single mother of two children, ages three and five. My husband is not in the picture, and I’m not on the birth certificate. I was married and I have kids. I have a very good job in the health care field, which means I sometimes travel. I have a great support network of friends and family. I’m currently in therapy for depression and anxiety, but that’s all treated and it’s not even on my health insurance.

I know that this sounds terrible, to be depressed and feel hopeless and lonely and have no idea how to cope with what has happened in my life, but I am just trying to survive, like everyone else. I really appreciate having the best health care plan possible because it means that the only thing I have to worry about is whether or not I am going to get well and if my family will be taken care of in the event that something happens to me. So far, I’ve had a very good year, until now.

I was driving on a local road this afternoon when it suddenly seemed as if there was a tornado coming at me. I swerved out of the way to get away from whatever it was and suddenly my car went airborne for what seemed like a very long time and then landed right side up in the ditch. It was definitely not my fault, which means I’m probably going to have a claim. Thank you for the way you are handling the situation. I know you are doing everything you can to make me whole again. Thank you.

(I hope that was clear.)

Here’s some useful, official sites with free information for those of you who are struggling with this:

You shouldn’t lie about your insurance claims history and risk rating. It is not necessary to get through insurance coverage to the full degree that is covered by the insurance. It is a good idea to pay extra premiums to make sure that you can get through any problems that you may encounter in your life, but this should not be done at the expense of making a false statement about your record</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:38
