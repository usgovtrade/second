5 comments on “How to Become a Human Resource Director”

When one of my friend asked me about how I got into this field I can only explain my situation, but let’s be frank it’s hard. Well anyway, I was a high school graduate, I’m 23 years old at the moment with a passion for working with students and young people. Actually I know that the HR field has a high turnover rate, and that’s why I’m here because I’m sure that with the help of some of the comments here I can make my dream come true. I never had the chance to work in HR, so of course I don’t have the background. What I have is a Master degree in Marketing and a very successful online business, as I’m writing this post I’m reading online business magazines and I’m looking at some job opportunities, because I also love to work and I’m willing to do some sacrifices. Also I love to travel and I would love to spend my time in the different countries. I would like to work as a HR executive in the online business, because it’s not common to find a job like that here, so it would be great to start with that. Thank you.

In these times, there are many positions available in the HR field. If you want to make a career in HR, you can also pursue an online course and start your HR career immediately. All you have to do is find a reputable college which provides you with the necessary courses and training.
