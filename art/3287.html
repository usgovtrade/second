The Goo Goo Dolls are at their best when they blend their sweet yet slightly melancholic sound with hard rock and arena rock. The video features a young female dancer with a very unique look. Check it out.

“Letting Go” by James Arthur

This singer’s vocal talent is undeniable. His tone and vocal range are exceptional. The lyrics are very mature and thoughtful. This could have easily been a ballad and it would have been a wonderful choice. He delivers in a style that would be well suited to country music.

“We Are The Same” by Dove Cameron

There’s no denying that this song is a crowd-pleaser. It seems that Dove Cameron has a wonderful stage presence, and an unmatched ability to write catchy lyrics. Her vocals give the song the pop sheen that fans will enjoy. It is catchy and memorable. It should definitely be on the list.

“Rise Up” by The R&B Revival

This has all the makings of a hit. It has the right sounds and has a catchy vocal. It may be a little too pop for country music, but the song makes you want to stand up and be counted, not just get up and go to work.

What songs do you think will be the big contenders in 2017?
