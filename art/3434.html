. The first reference to "I AM" is in the episode "All About Mormons," originally broadcast November 1, 2007, www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s14e01-all-about-mormons. In this episode the four boys are sent to go to a Christian camp, which is a thinly disguised parody of The Master's Camp. As part of their training, they are told to write down their names on an index card and sign the card. The first name they write on their card is I AM RICHARD WAGNER, and that is the title of this segment of the episode. The irony is that in the show South Park Mormons are mocked, but in the episode South Park Jew, the name that is written on the card is Jewish.

. In this episode, Cartman gets an anal thermometer, the first South Park character to have one. To get an anal thermometer, we first have to find the definition for it: it's a device inserted into the anus to measure temperature. It's like a woman, but for the anus. Then, the idea of getting anal therapy makes us think of a doctor who is specially trained to treat disorders of the anus, hence anal therapy or rectal massage. But still, there are still some problems in the episode that it is not clear why we need to search for an anal therapy, or rectal massage.
