increasing environmental constraints and a lack of skilled labour. 
In addition to optimizing our current manufacturing facilities, we must 
continue to focus our efforts on developing sustainable new technologies to 
create more efficient and less wasteful processes. As new technology 
provides the key to increasing profitability, our strategy drives us towards 
high growth markets.

Environmental, Health & Safety (EH&S) 
In the first half of 2002, we recorded a loss of $13.4 million on expenses 
associated with environmental, health and safety expenses and an additional 
$2.5 million charge in the second quarter primarily associated with 
consulting expenses associated with the restructuring of our global mining 
operation. 

Operational Improvement Initiatives

Our objective for 2002 remains our 2000 performance of profitable, sustaining 
growth with total returns to shareholders in line with our performance during 
the 1990s and before. While we continue to meet this objective, we did incur 
some loss in recent quarters due to some unusual, non-recurring charges that 
were partly offset by foreign exchange gains. In the second quarter of this 
year, we expect to continue to incur a loss on the sale of land and real 
estate in South America due to continued under-performance and an increase in 
the costs of these assets. We continue to implement new cost management 
initiatives, and anticipate further improvements in the rest of 2002.


Venezuelan LNG Project 
In November 2001 we reached an agreement with Petroleos de Venezuela, SA and 
BHP Petroleum Company, LNG Australia Pty Ltd (BP LNG) to move forward with 
the development of a major liquefied natural gas project, in which Enron will 
be the operator and a minority shareholder. As at September 30, 2001, our 
equity investment in the project was $US33 million. We expect this figure to 
rise substantially based on a recently announced equity contribution from 
Petronet (the Indian owned subsidiary of BP), taking our investment to 
$US123 million. Following Petronet's equity contribution, Enron's ownership 
will rise to 55% and BHP's to 45%. The project is in the pre-FEED stage and 
involves the construction of a new two train liquefaction facility, the 
severed export pipeline and the ocean terminal at Jose at the Venezuelan 
coast. Construction of the new liquefaction facility and the export pipeline 
has commenced, with  the first export expected in the first quarter of 2004. 
The FEED stage is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2003 with 
production targeted to commence in the first quarter of 2006. This is an 
important project for Enron as it will be our first project in Venezuela 
having sold the major share in Tractebel in 1999. We currently have two front 
office staff in Caracas managing the sale process for the project's major 
equity component, a 20 year LNG sale gas supply contract. We also continue 
with due diligence and site selection on two other frontier market projects, 
including a potential power project in Egypt and a gas and liquids project 
in Turkmenistan. We continue to have an asset management group in place 
assisting with the development of the BP LNG asset in Venezuela. 
In addition, our merchant assets group continues to actively manage and expand 
our merchant portfolio.


IN THE NEWS

We are keepers of the flame in this market downturn, saying that the state 
of the economy is not as bad as most of the press makes out. We should not 
be so humble and should not be undermining our own arguments by saying that 
perhaps we have ridden a market bubble and the state of the market is not so 
bleak after all. One thing we have proved is that the market returns to long 
term fundamentals. All the naysayers talked about ten years ago have been 
proven wrong: growth is returning to earnings, inflation is falling, market 
expectations are realigned towards the fundamentals. We believe that good 
times will return in 2002. Our recent analysis of the US long-term growth 
story explains why we think all the scepticism about next year is misplaced. 
There are at least five catalysts for a sustainable earnings recovery: an 
improving economy, low capacity and inventory utilisation rates, increased 
economic wealth, increased business and personal confidence and a willingness 
to invest. The key question, we say, is whether the current trends in the 
fundamentals will remain constant or whether they will deteriorate, causing a 
recovery to become a recession. At present the US outlook is positive. 

We see further events on a global scale which may well bring stability to the 
market and good times for those who are well positioned at the moment. The 
political situation in South America continues to stabilise as new elections 
are held in the following countries: Brazil and Argentina, both expected to 
be pro-business. If the new pro-market government in Brazil does its job 
properly, we believe that this may help the South American countries as a 
whole and enable them to return to sustained economic growth. We also believe 
that Argentina may be able to return to international capital markets, and 
this could bring stability to South America. The most important change in 
North America is the anticipated positive effect of an oil-focused economy on 
the world outlook, combined with a move to cut interest rates by the FED. 
Lower energy prices should bring some relief to the USA and a slower economy 
should be less of a problem as world confidence returns. 

Finally, we said recently that the stock markets were not making big 
fundamental mistakes. Now we have done something that we don't normally do: 
we are talking about our own company. However, we want to emphasise the point 
that the fact that a company makes its own earnings mistakes does not prevent 
it from making successful changes to its portfolio. Indeed, Enron is 
proposing to reduce its debt, and to do this successfully Enron will have to 
generate more cash flow to pay back the debt. We would argue that the 
company's success will be determined by the returns on investments it makes 
from this cash flow.
