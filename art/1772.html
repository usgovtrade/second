This was a really awesome film about a woman who is a long-term sufferer of depression who has come out the other side and is on a mission to give back to those with the same illness.

It’s a wonderful and extremely moving film, which highlights the importance of mental health, the stigma surrounding it and the need to talk and acknowledge it.

We follow an actress going through an immense journey and coming to the realisation that talking to others can make a big difference and people all around her are in the same boat.

She also has an amazing voice which makes it a wonderful watch. We see her in action and she makes a massive difference in people’s lives.

I would highly recommend this film and it’s something you’ll likely take with you after you watch it.

It highlights that there is always someone worse off than you. We can’t be self-obsessed, so don’t let what other people have put you down influence you too.

“The Kite Runner”

This is a heart-warming and emotional story about love and forgiveness. It follows the lives of three best friends in Afghanistan. The younger brother of one of them has recently come to America and he’s a drug addict.

He’s asked to go back and is then confronted by the friend who has found him and how he is running out of time to help him.

It’s really fantastic seeing how this turns around the lives of these boys and their families.

These are just a few films we have enjoyed at the cinema that have helped us and given us a greater understanding of some of the important issues surrounding mental health.
