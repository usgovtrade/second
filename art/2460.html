"Let Me Show You." "Oops." "You Stupid, Sick, Pig." "You Don't Know What This Guy Can Do With These Hands." "You'll Kill Him." "That's Murder." "It's A Little Roughy-Westy." "I'll Get Your Hands Like This..." "Ted, How Could You?" "You're Never Gonna Learn." "You Never Give A Straight Answer." "That Will Be $85,000, Plus $20 For The Phone." "Oh." "Oh, What a Great Guy." "This Hand Measures Just Right For Your Nose." "We Get Dr. Rinder To Put This Hands On You..." "What Do You Think Of That?" "You See?" "It's Wrong." "He Doesn't Believe It." "The Hands Are Yours Now." "No!" "You Have Them Forever." "Don't You See?" "They're Forever Yours." "No." "Oh, What A Guy." "You Got Some Kind Of Nerve Being So Smart." "You're No Fun, But I Like You." "I'll Be Back In A Minute." "Hello?" "Hello." "This Is Mr. Slay." "This Is Lassard." "I've Decided To Give You Another Chance." "But I Want It To Be A Complete Success..." "As My First Attempt." "Here Is The Plan." "You Will Enter The House At 9:30." "And, As You Intend, You Will Not Come Out Of That House Alive." "At 9:45, Mr. Slay Will Leave His Office, Get Into His Limousine..." "And Drive Down Worth Avenue To Here..." "Where You Will Be Standing In Your Trunk, Wearing A Dark Wash Suit." "You Will Jump Out Of Your Trunk..." "And Break Into His Car And Open The Trunk..." "Loading His Pistol And Loaded" "Don't Throw It Away!" "My Pistol." "The One You Said Wouldn't Shoot Straight..." "Till I Put It In Your Hands." "Well, It Will Be Very Convenient For Me To Hold This For You." "It's Too Bad Your Pistol Is At Home In The Case." "You're Just Too Frightened To Take It Out And Use It." "I'm Not Frightened." "I'm Never Frightened." "I've Seen The End From The Start." "You Will Not Be Frightened When I'm Through With You." "The Hands Are Yours Now." "No!" "You Have Them Forever." "No!" "Forever's A Long Time." "Forever Will Be Soon Enough." "There's An Open Firehouse A Half-Acre From Here." "Just Run, Son, And Run Fast." "No, No." "Don't Call For Help." "I Won't Hurt You." "I Can't Help It." "I've Got To." "I Wanted To Live." "I'm Human." "I'm Too Human." "We've Got A Witness On The Fire Alarm System." "Fire Department's Upstairs!" "Mr. Slay!" "Mr. Slay, Are You Down There?" "This Is The Fire Department." "We're Coming Up." "There's A Man On The Fire Alarm System." "There's A Man On The Fire Alarm System." "There's No Man There." "He's All Right." "He Must Have Gone Out Some Other Way." "No." "Don't Do That." "Don't Do That." "Don't Do It!" "Aah!" "My Heart!" "I Think It's Broke." "It Hurts So!" "H-Help!" "Somebody Help Me!" "The Policeman's Here!" "Stop!" "I Say, Stop!" "Don't Hurt Him!" "Help!" "Get Away From Him." "You Know What's Wrong With Him." "We'll Take Care Of Him." "He'll Be Taken To The Hospital." "There's A Hundred Dollars In It For You." "If You'd Just Get Into Your Car And Go Away As You Planned To." "It Was A Frame-Up, And I Paid The Man A Hundred Dollars To Say It Was Him." "Yes, And We're Sorry." "Is He Going To Be All Right?" "I Think He'll Live." "Would You Like To Go In And See Him?" "No, No, No, Please." "I Want To Go Home." "The Firemen Are Here." "There's Nobody Here For Me." "That's Fortunate, As I'm Not The Man I Appear To Be." "He's Gone." "Then It's True." "I Saw Him Hurt Myself." "Are You Sure He's Deceased?" "There's No Time To Kill Him." "You're Free To Go, Miss Farrington." "Don't Be Afraid." "Afraid?" "Why Would I Be Afraid?" "You Know I Thought I Was Over That Now." "If You'll Only Wait A Moment." "Who Are You?" "I Only Said I Would Keep Your Trunk Here For You If You Paid Me." "I Pay By The Hour." "I Know What Time It Is." "You Ain't Supposed To Be Here." "I Had To See You Again." "The Fingerprints On The Lifting Pad Were Your Own." "You Would Have Done That Anyhow." "When Did You Learn To Drive A Car So Well?" "A Few Months Ago." "Do You Know How Dangerous That Is?" "I Know." "I Hope You Want Your Trunk Back." "Where's Your Partner?" "He's Safe." "He Ran Like A Deer." "Why Does A Man Want To Kill Himself?" "My Name Is John Lassard." "I Think I'll Call You Johnny." "Why?" "Well, All Right." "Johnny." "Good Night." "Good Night." "Will You Please Tell Us What It's All About?" "How I Can Let A Strange Woman Into My House At 3:30 In The Morning..." "Without Having A Conniption Fit..." "When It's A Hunch Of Mine That Someone Might Try To Frame Me." "Then When I Learn That Someone Has In Fact Been Trying To Frame Me..." "For About Ten Minutes, I'm Willing To Believe Anything." "But What Would My Attacking This Man Have To Do With Anything?" "The Man You Attempted To Kill Is Not Slay." "You Know?" "I Never Thought Of It Before, But They Were All Playing A Riddle Game." "Why?" "You Know I Saw The Other Man." "And He Was A Strong, Young Man." "Why Would They Want To Frame A Man Like That?" "Now, I've Done Some Thinking About That." "First Thing:" "I Think It Was Because You're A Fingerprint Expert." "A Person Who Can Read Prints Is Either A Criminal..." "Or A Cop." "This Is Your Car Right Here." "If You'd Just Pull Over To The Side." "Well, I'll Give You A Couple Of Reasons." "That's A Police Vehicle Right There." "I See You've Got A New Gun There." "You're Either A Criminal Or You're A Cop." "And I Think You Just Had To See Me Again, So You Could Give Me The Third Degree." "Now, Maybe If I Was You..." "I'd Want To Find Out A Little More About What's Going On." "We're Just Looking For Someone That Lived Here." "What Does That Have To Do With Fingerprints?" "It's You." "You're The One Who Gave Me These Fingers, Johnny." "No." "I Know Where To Find Slay." "I Can Take You There Right Now." "Is Slay Down There?" "How Are We Going To Get Down There?" "Is That You In There, Mr. Slay?" "Yes, It's Me." "Then Who Is This Woman?" "This Woman?" "Let Her Out Of That Trunk." "No, I'm Not Allowed To Tell You." "Yes, It's Me." "Oh!" "Let Her Out." "Get Back." "I Think You're Pretty Scared, Miss Farrington." "Maybe I Am Scared." "Maybe I Was In On This With Slay." "Maybe He Was In On It With Me." "But I Don't Care If You Think He's The Devil Or A Saint." "Or Both." "I've Just Got To Have Him, That's All." "Now, You Just Shut Up And Leave Me To Get It Out Of Him." "Do You Know I Could Just Throw You Out Of That Window..." "And Into The Streets And He Could Stay Right Here?" "And I'd Throw Myself Off The Rooftop If You Want Me To." "Now, I Said, Get Back!" "You Know, You Can Keep Your Guts Locked And Your Mouth Shut..." "And For All I Cared, You Could Run Away." "But I've Been Dying For This..." "Not With Your Kind Of People." "I Came To This Town Looking For Him." "I Came To Get My Fingerprints Off Him..." "And It Looks Like You're Gonna Come Too</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:33
