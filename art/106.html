"That dance  we just did ... was very unselfish of you." "This is a tough town." "I know that." "What do you want, some kind of a big thank-you ?" "I wouldn't have made it if it hadn't been for you." "Now we're even." "It wasn't us." "It was you." "It was all you." "You're the man." "You're the guy." "They're gonna know it." "Take it easy." "It's a tough town." "You don't know what you're talking about." "I don't know what I'm talking about?" "Let me tell you something." "I came here from Abnerveilles ... with 1 0 guys, two bags of flour and nothing but the shirt on our back." "You took us to the big time in one month." "All right, I was there, too, but you ... you were the main act." "You got so big ... it could have been Broadway." "Broadway." "I got it." "But don't kid yourself." "This is as far as we get." "But you're not through yet, pal." "Hey." "Do you know where they're playing tonight?" "The Crystal Palace?" "I'll take you." "Come on, baby." "I'll take you there." "I got you." "You ain't gonna drop me now, huh?" "No." "I'll take you there, and then I'm gonna go home." "So what?" "Somebody else take me home." "Let me tell you something, pal." "Somebody's always gonna be there for you." " You know what I mean?" " Somebody else?" " I'm not kidding you." " They'll never ... get it as good as they got it, you know?" "Look at me." "This whole deal?" "It's like a free ride." " It's not worth it." "Look at it this way, pal." "You done for tonight?" "What's the matter with you?" "You should be happy." "Look at it this way." "Two guys and a girl." "What a team." "That's better than two, no?" "I don't want you to get in trouble." "Don't look." "If they see us ... they might think you were ... trying to have a little intercourse or something." "Oh, yeah." "We'll have a nice, long walk." "I don't want you to have to do that." " That's all right." " Come on." "Don't look." "Can you imagine?" "If a guy could do this, believe me ... you would not have to worry about girls." "Come on." "You can't lose." "You go where I tell you." "I tell you where to go." "I tell you how to behave." "Okay." "It's so great, no?" "All the people looking ... you don't even feel like you're with them." "When they leave, you feel as if they've all gone crazy ... right through you." "Here we are." "I'll be right back." "Where you going?" "I gotta take a leak." "We'll have a good time." "We'll have a party, huh?" "Come on." "Come on." "Give me a kiss." "Wait." "Not here." "Come on." "Let's go." "Come on." "You're making a big mistake." "Okay, let's go." "Come on, baby."

""I put in half a buck."" "And he was really grateful." "You know what I mean?" "He was happy." "Yeah, you know what I mean?" "I really liked him." "I gotta get going." "No, no, no." "Stay there."
