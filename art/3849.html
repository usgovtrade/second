I’m not sure if I agree with the way that the game is being presented and packaged. It seems as if it’s marketed to a younger audience than normal, and the box cover might just have been designed for kids, as opposed to someone who can appreciate the history of a game, for example. The price point of the game is also slightly above average for a PS3 game. However, as I said before, the game itself does make up for all that, and I feel as if I’m being presented with a great PS3 game. The setting that we are visiting feels like a place that could only be pulled off in the PS3 era. Giving us an in-depth view of a world with all the freedom we can expect to see on the PS3 platform. And not just that, giving us a glimpse into one of the most epic moments of the series, and by that I mean the Battle of the Black Clouds. One can also see that the visuals of Kingdom Hearts 2.5 ReMIX have been given a bit of a boost, since we can appreciate the improvements on the 1080p and the frame rate, with no slowdown to speak of.

The only thing that I would have done is to add in an option to choose between the cut scenes with English subtitles and the Japanese voices. Having to turn the English subtitle on can be a bit annoying after a while, and this can be due to having to turn the English subtitle off when you’re in the cut scenes. As for the Japanese voice, it may not always be an option for those who are playing the game and have the audio quality set on 5.1. In order to do away with that issue, it would be quite alright to implement a feature like this into Kingdom Hearts 3D [Dream Drop Distance]. And so, I think we can consider it to be a great title in its own right, and I will continue to be looking forward to future developments for Square Enix’s masterpiece.

Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is a fun, enjoyable and interesting game, especially for someone who has never played a Kingdom Hearts game before, as it does an excellent job at pulling players into the series with the right setting, story, characters and gameplay. If you’re a newbie and are unsure of whether or not you should pick up this game, then I would recommend taking a chance with the game as it’s very fun and interesting. However, if you are one of the many players who’s played every Kingdom Hearts game up until this one, then you’ll find yourself enjoying it even more. There’s so much to love about this game, and I think that it will easily be one of the best games released this year.

Thank you for reading.

The first thing that you’ll see is a short movie. The movie shows Sora’s battle against the heartless. You can see the battle with the King as he is being defeated by a very evil heartless with no name, and a shadow is cast over the heartless’s shadow. With the heartless defeated, Sora and his friends find themselves walking through a corridor where they come across a heartless who is causing things to go bump in the night. Then, they come to a sudden stop where they are greeted by a familiar face. That face is Big A. Now, Sora and the gang are now in a new world, which is where we will continue to pick up.

Back from the Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, the gang find themselves right next to a forest and an interestingly shaped cloud, known as Castle Oblivion. As Sora and friends reach out for the cloud, a light shines onto the characters and brings Sora back to his sleep. Once awake, Sora and the gang watch as Axel’s shadow form grows to its giant form, and Riku’s hand transforms into a sword that aims to kill Axel. This time, Riku wins, as the shadow form disappears and he gains back his lost memories. With the memories back, we see that Sora and his friends continue on to Castle Oblivion. A mysterious voice says: “It’s been a long time since we’ve had any new guests.”

As Sora and his gang continues to walk through the forest, they find that the once peaceful night has been replaced with something sinister. As they continue forward, the ground begins to shake, and there seems to be a struggle between Sora’s friends as a strange substance materialises around Sora. Then, a tall, old-looking man appears who tells Sora and his friends that he is looking for his “beloved one”. The man is soon joined by Axel, who then asks the strange man if he could use his home. Unfortunately, the man refuses and orders Axel to leave.

After some conflict with the man, Riku appears from the shadows and informs Sora that the man is the ruler of the area known as Castle Oblivion. He explains that the man’s name is aeons, and he is the leader of the Dark Kingdom, which includes the Kingdom of Corona, the Land of Departure and Castle Oblivion, of which Castle Oblivion is a very important place for the Dark Kingdom. Aeons explains to Sora and friends that he will not permit anyone to leave the castle once they reach the main door, but Sora and Riku beg him not to turn them away, since he is their only hope.

With a conflict between the two, Sora and his friends eventually convince Aeons to allow them to enter Castle Oblivion. As they are allowed to enter, the walls start to close in on them, and Sora finds himself on a cliff and facing a tower. It then feels as if the castle itself tries to eat him, but Sora manages to keep fighting on. After a difficult battle with the castle, Sora manages to stay alive while Riku and Axel succumb to the attacks from the castle.

Inside the castle, Sora and his friends walk down a hallway filled with doors. The doors then open up to show a place known as the Heartless Corridor, where there are several heartless around. As they enter, Sora and his friends find themselves being greeted by a familiar voice, which tells them that they have come to the wrong place. The voice is none other than Tinkerbelle, who warns them to “not enter the heartless corridor”. With no way out, Sora and his friends find themselves in a room with what appears to be five doors which appear to connect to where they are standing.

Sora opens up one of the doors, which has a hallway with an upside down castle on the ceiling. He then meets a strange man named Cyrus, who tells him about Aeons and the way he runs Castle Oblivion. Aeons and Cyrus once had a connection, but then Aeons’s heart was stolen by Nyx. Cyrus explains to Sora and friends that Nyx is the same as Aeons, but worse. Cyrus says that he’s going to see if he can help them to escape the castle, so he asks them to stay still. As Cyrus leaves, Sora finds himself having to deal with a new character known as Dizzy, who looks to be in trouble.

Sora and his friends eventually find themselves in a battle with Dizzy as she tries to put her plan into action. With the heartless defeated, Sora and his friends find themselves on the other side of Castle Oblivion, where there is an entrance to the heartless corridor.

Back in the heartless corridor, Sora and his friends find themselves encountering Axel who is walking down the corridor when he spots someone. This someone is none other than Maleficent, who seems to be very weak and near the end. As Axel begins to converse with Maleficent, we are treated to a little bit of back story from the Disney movie. Maleficent explains to Axel that, if it wasn’t for the curse from the Fairy Queen, she would have ended her days without love and she was willing to give her life for her child. The curse didn’t give her back her heart, but it did give her the power to turn a human into a beast, making them weaker than normal humans. Since then, she has been hiding for many years away from the human world, and has continued to create cursed objects which bring her humans into her world.

With Maleficent in poor health, Axel asks her to go with him so that they can find a way out. As he goes to leave with her, however, he finds that the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:54:08
