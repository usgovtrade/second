His friends agreed, and after leaving
the group briefly, he returned and 
said: 'Let's hear 
Nietzsche next, shall we?' 
One of his friends told him that 
he'd 
forgotten to do the dishes, and the
guy's response was: 'Why?' 
Weird, right? Weird, 
or brilliant?
A teacher was discussing a child 
whom 
she had seen in the playground. 
'A little boy of seven came 
over to me and pointed to a large 
stain on the ground and 
said, ' 
This must be the stain from an 
elephant.' 
One of his friends, who was 
standing at a distance 
overheard the conversation, and 
asked him: ' What do you play at 
elephants?' 
'What do you mean?' 
'How do you go about playing 
elephants?' 
The guy thought about this for a 
while and then replied: 
'What do you play at?' 
So after the friend had repeated 
the question to him, he was 
understandably confused and said: 
'What do you mean?' 
His friend explained: 'Look, you 
say to a friend: 
'Hey, look at this stain, it must 
be a large 
elephant-track.' Or, 'There must be 
an elephant nearby.' That's 
playing 
at the elephant.
You must give me your phone number
or email address in order to keep 
in touch 
with you. 'I already know your 
phone number,' 
the guy told her. 
'But I don't know yours,' she 
replied, ' I'll tell you mine if 
you tell me 
yours.'
