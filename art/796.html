Quiggly walked a step further into the dark when something else caught his attention. He bent down and looked under a clump of leaves, his heart in his throat. It was gone. Another scream of anguish was heard from the forest as Quiggly ran out of the darkness, out of the forest, down the highway and into the village.

Another scream was heard in the silence of the village. Quiggly rushed to the man lying on the ground with blood slowly trickling down his neck. She screamed with fear as she saw that her baby had been slaughtered.

"It wasn't a prank. It's him, your old man! He murdered the baby! He murdered my child!" She said, screaming in pain, pointing at her husband, lying dead on the ground, covered in his blood, his face frozen in an expression of horror.

The crowd gathered. Quiggly approached his lifeless body. "It wasn't him. He's dead. It was my baby!"

"Who killed your baby, my dear?"

"That man there, with the long hair."

"Your husband? I thought he was your lover."

"My husband? Never. He's dead. The baby's father was him. He was the killer! He's not my husband. He's dead. He killed the baby, all for a few dollars, thinking it was a prank! I couldn't protect my child anymore. He's not my husband. My husband is dead. He killed my child!"

The village people stood in silence. In the eyes of an innocent child, they had now made another tragedy. They had already seen one boy lost, they had already seen one love stolen. They had seen one man run out of the village, one man killed. Now they had witnessed another man die, another tragedy and this was only the beginning.

"What did he do to you, my dear?"

The people were curious.

"He killed my child and then he murdered him, he was the one who ran out of the village with him. He was the one who murdered my child. He's not my husband, he's the killer. The baby's father was him. He was the murderer.

"My son was my child. I would have called him 'sweetheart', my poor baby, but now, my sweetie is dead. He murdered my child!"

"I didn't know him. I never even talked to him. I'm an innocent woman. I'm a fool!"

"He was my child, he was my baby. He's gone, my darling, gone, my sweetie, gone. He had a cold little nose and big eyes. I'd rub his little head until he fell asleep. My baby was my life. My baby is gone. He killed him. He murdered him!"

"I've been with him for the longest. I've been waiting for him for the longest. What a fool I am!"

"He's gone, I didn't know him. My sweetie is gone. He was my child. My sweetie, my child, my child, my baby, my beloved, he's gone, gone, gone. He's dead."

"Who did it? Who killed him? Who murdered my child?"

The people were curious.

"My baby was my heart. My baby is dead. He's gone, he's dead. He's a murderer."

There was a sudden surge of whispers.

"He's the killer. He killed my sweetie. He's the killer. He's the murderer. He's the killer. He's the killer."

"Oh, my, God, I didn't know him. He's gone, my baby, gone, my sweetie, gone. He was my child, he was my baby. He's gone, my baby, gone, my child, gone, my beloved, he's gone, he's dead, he's dead.
