The way to avoid these problems, is to give tax exemptions to charities for their private foundations. This will allow them to invest without distorting the market. If anything, there should be a tax credit to donors who donate to charity and these taxes paid to the government are used to reduce income taxes.

In short, in a capitalist society there should not be any taxes on charity. Period.

I think the idea of this article is to help individuals become better philanthropists, hence the word here is philanthropy.

No sane person would support a system in which the government is allowed to keep a portion of your labor, and you are forced to give it to others. That is the essence of slavery.

And taxes. If the only way to collect taxes were by the government stealing from the rich, they’d make certain the rich lost almost every penny of wealth, so that the poor would be left penniless.

We can see that the rich do not keep their money. It goes to the government, who uses it as a weapon against poor people. The rich aren’t rich. They are using the government to keep others poor.

In the words of Ron Paul: “Government as slavery has reached a point where no one is allowed to keep more than a tiny portion of what they produce.” The people are free to choose who they want to give their taxes to, as well as which charities they donate to. If the government gets in the way of that, it must be a violation of rights.

And I know, the poor could choose to be more moral, and not cheat, which would put them on equal footing with the wealthy. But that would ruin capitalism, and there is no argument for that.

Ayn Rand

If someone wanted to start a discussion, it might be interesting to ask why people do not support taxation in all cases. Could it be that some people do not like to spend more than is needed, especially when others, who have less, would be able to spend it?

People, including conservatives, tend to support capitalism because they recognize the need to keep others down as a class. Many conservatives do not like to spend more than they need to, and the same is true of some liberals, including Ron Paul.

But people also like to vote for people who give them handouts. They don’t like to spend themselves into poverty, even when they don’t need to.

Ron Paul knows this. He also knows that he cannot talk about his belief in the morality of charity without taking on the pro-slavery and pro-wealth inequality conservatives who get support from Christians. He cannot win. The conservatives are the winners in this game.

To win in politics, he needs to win a conservative majority. So he has decided to pretend to be a conservative. Of course, he supports the military (more conservatives than liberals do) and the death penalty (more conservatives than liberals do), as well as traditional marriage, even though he is homosexual.

Why? Because if he is ever to get into power, he must get a majority of conservative votes. Only if he wins them, can he do his job of reforming capitalism.

But as long as people don’t support capitalism, he is not necessary. He has to pretend that he believes in the morality of charity, so that he can persuade people that he is a real conservative.

So, if you ask a conservative about the morality of charity, he will support it. If you ask him about getting rid of taxes, he will say that there should be tax breaks for charity. If you ask him to name a single group he supports, he will name it.

That is how he stays in the game. He doesn’t want to be exposed, because the reality is that he isn’t conservative, and he doesn’t support capitalism. He supports the conservatives.

To change things, all we need to do is to talk about a new vision of capitalism, in which everyone would work, but they wouldn’t keep the money. That would force people to learn how to work together to produce more than they need, so that they can share that with everyone. This is possible, because the system would include charity.

I’ve been watching a lot of movies. So I decided to start a list of the best (which have been made since 1987). I am limiting myself to movies that were not nominated for an Oscar. It’s not so much that I don’t like Oscar-winning movies, but there are so many of them, that I don’t even have time to watch all of them.

The list is chronological, in the order that they were released. The first movie on the list is Avatar.

In the first grade, I taught myself to read and write. I was taught to do this by my mother, who told me that since I could not remember my own name, it was no good to use the name she used to call me, which was my older brother’s name. Instead, she said I should use the name I called her.

When my brother became “old enough” to be taught to read, his name became my name. He was happy that I didn’t get my own name. It probably had something to do with sex. Because my sister was called “my sister”, which meant that she would get her own name when she got older. But I couldn’t wait that long.

I thought that I would get my own name. And I did. My name was “Jarv”, after the teacher at the elementary school who taught me.

In the second grade, I learned to count money. This was from a friend who used to own a business selling lottery tickets. He taught me how to count money. When I was about 5 or 6, I ran his little business, and he showed me how to count the money from the ticket sales, to divide it up among the people who had sold tickets.

In the third grade, we learned to write. It was called the “little children’s alphabet” in school. To find out how to write the letters, I asked my teacher at school how to spell the word “dog”, which was what I wanted to write.

In the fourth grade, I was given a little chalk and a board. I wrote my name and a few words and sentences in the school chalkboard. When the teacher saw it, he gave me a reward for being so good. When I was alone in class with a friend of mine, I wrote things on the board, and we copied them down, so that we would be able to read each other’s writing.

By the fifth grade, I knew the alphabet, and the words and sentences I knew were copied off the board. When the teacher saw my handwriting, he told me that I could keep reading as long as I was ahead of my classmates. I wrote a sentence with the words “The King is dead.” Then I turned to a friend of mine and said, “Did you understand that?”

By the sixth grade, my writing was so good that the teacher used me to teach other children to write. But he paid me in candy, and gave me a certificate for every letter in the alphabet. The certificate was pretty, so I displayed it in the frame on my wall.

In the seventh grade, I learned that I was not the only one in the class that the teacher thought should be paid to read and write. There was also a girl who was my classmate and friend who was in my writing class.

She got all the same candy and certificates that I got. But since she was smaller than I was, she was given a smaller award.

When the teacher praised us, the teacher praised her more than me. I didn’t know why. So I asked the teacher.

The teacher said, “You are the one who knows all the letters and words, and who knows how to write.” So I decided to ask my friend the reason for the difference. I had never thought about it before, but the only reason I could think of was that she was older than me.

I was only half right. It wasn’t her age that caused her to receive better treatment, but the fact that she had had sex. I had never thought about that, but now I knew. I felt sad.

In the eighth grade, I wrote some of my poems about sex. I saw that it made the girls all giggle when they read them. They had to be read out loud, and could not just be read to myself.

One day, when I had finished with my writing, I gave the poems to my friend, who read them to her classmates. The poems were about how hard the girls worked for money to keep the guys at home all the time. The teachers did not understand them, but the girls did.

The teacher also understood them. That is why he had a crush on my friend.

When I asked him about it, he told me that I didn’t have to worry, because he was already married. So I never told him about my own sexual experiences.

In the ninth grade, I started having sex. I had not understood that sex could be for pleasure, or that it could cause people to have orgasms.

I never talked about it, because my parents</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:22
