The story appears to have originated in Newfoundland in 1605, but is very well known in Scotland, and forms part of a national epic, the "Fause Foodrage".

The French in North America

In 1562, the second year of François I's reign, the King sent Jean Ribault with nine ships and five hundred colonists to occupy the region of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The expedition failed miserably. Ribault was captured by Spaniards, who forced him to join their wars against France. Ribault eventually returned in 1564 and established Fort Caroline near Jacksonville, Florida. He soon fell in love with the daughter of the Spanish governor at St. Augustine, Catherine de Ribaupierre, and was sent to France to negotiate an end to the conflict. This marriage was a diplomatic failure, but did result in the transfer of Florida to France in 1565. Ribault was one of the few to survive the massacre by Indian tribes in 1565–1567.

Ribault's son-in-law, René de Laudonnière, who commanded Fort Caroline, was ordered in 1565 to destroy the fort and kill everyone in it (the last four words of the official French royal order). He disobeyed, and tried unsuccessfully to establish an alliance with the natives. He, his family, and those Indians who escaped from the massacre were slaughtered and eaten. In 1568, St. Augustine was returned to Spanish control. In 1682, Florida was finally ceded to Spain by the treaty of Paris, and the colony was incorporated into the Louisiana colony.

The French in Acadia

In 1604, Charles I, the last of the early Stuart Kings, gave the French crown rights to colonize all of North America east of the river St. Croix. French settlers, traders and fishermen had already been established on both sides of the Atlantic. The French king's rights to the area were later confirmed in a royal charter of 1627. By then, the French settlement on the southern coast of Newfoundland was already prosperous and politically independent, although it retained a nominal allegiance to the French crown.

The French colony on the coast of Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island was first established by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts, in 1534, the year of the establishment of the French "colony" of Hochelaga (Montreal). In 1598, de Monts was given power to colonize the region, and in 1604, he established the French colony of Port Royal on the coast of Newfoundland. In the summer of 1610, a French expedition sailed southward, took possession of what is now Cape Breton Island and founded a settlement at what is now Louisbourg. In addition, the French had fishing settlements at various points along the coasts. These settlements were primarily for the supply of the French and Basque fishing fleets engaged in trade with the colonies of France and Spain and the indigenous peoples of the region. The Acadian colonies on the southern shore of the gulf of St. Lawrence were primarily intended for the supply of the French fishing fleets.

The French settlement of Louisbourg was destroyed by English settlers in 1613, and in 1625 the English established the permanent Fort Pentagouet (later Louisbourg) at the entrance to the Bay of Fundy. The Acadian settlements were likewise lost, one by one, to the New Englanders from the autumn of 1654. The most southern of the Acadian settlements, Port Royal, was permanently lost to the English at the beginning of 1690.

Louisbourg was the most productive of the Atlantic fishing stations, for it contained more than a hundred stone-built houses and fortifications, and it provided a regular supply of provisions and other supplies for the fisheries. As a fishing station, it was largely destroyed, for the local Indians became disaffected and the colony had to be relocated by the French in the summer of 1705. The French population at Louisbourg and other Acadian colonies gradually increased to almost six thousand by the end of the seventeenth century, during which time the Acadian farmers and fishermen expanded their settlements and their fishing enterprises. The fisheries were a particularly effective method for accumulating wealth among the Acadian settlers in the eighteenth century, which became the era of the Great Upheaval.

New France: The Great Upheaval (1688–1763)

The French were pushed out of Acadia after the French and Indian War in 1758. The British controlled New France from 1763 to the end of the American Revolution.

French colonization in the Maritimes

Despite the Acadian Expulsion, there was continued colonization in Acadia for a number of years. Fishing villages near Grand-Pré were re-founded and later at Chignecto and Beaubassin. Fishing villages were also begun at Halifax and Dartmouth. Some Acadian families moved to France and Holland after the Expulsion. A French colony was founded at Cape Breton Island.

French colonization in Lower Canada

The British conquered Acadia in 1710, and the French remained for the next thirty years. (See Franco-Acadian rivalry). It took them some time to organize their defenses in the region. They established the short-lived colonies of Villebon and Port-Royal, which were lost to the British in 1713. Port-Royal was replaced by settlements at Chaleurs Bay, La Haye-du-Puits and at Beauport. They returned to Port-Royal in 1720, but were not able to control the Abenaki Indians in the area. The French eventually reoccupied Port-Royal in 1745 after a brief British occupation during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748).

The French re-established their colonies at the Habitation at Ste Anne de Beaupré in 1720 and at Île Royale in 1732.

French colonization in Upper Canada

The French did not begin to establish a colonial presence in the lands now known as the Canadian province of Ontario until after the War of the Spanish Succession, the beginning of the Great European Wars. This conflict was initially an indirect conflict in which the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) erupted as a consequence of the global policies of power developed by the English-speaking colonial powers. The conflict with France, known as the French and Indian War, broke out in North America in 1754 and was fought mainly in British North America and along the western edges of colonial New France. In 1759, England declared war on France in an effort to capture the strategically valuable Canadian port of Québec. New France had been largely destroyed in the British attack in 1759–1760. Canada was turned over to the British and renamed "Canada" to conform with France's former territories in Europe.

The French colony of Fort Frontenac, on the site of modern Kingston, was taken over by a British expedition in 1760 and renamed "Kingston" in commemoration of the King's birthday. A new fort was built at the foot of the present Queen's Quay (Queen's wharf). In 1763, after the conclusion of the peace, the French Fort Niagara was renamed Fort Cataraqui to honour King George III of England. Fort Erie was established on the site of present-day Fort Erie at a strategic position along the old Port of Niagara and the Niagara River. The site was initially a small log fort, later named Fort George, after the then Duke of York.

In the 1750s, the French-speaking inhabitants of Canada, called Canadien, had come to believe that they were entitled to a separate and autonomous colony with its own government. The Quebec Act of 1774 recognized this, and granted them autonomy as long as they paid tribute. The French peasantry found that their English-speaking overseers (the "purchasers", in the terminology of the Quebec Act) would often give them fewer supplies than those the British gave to their colonists. They resented this unfair treatment, and protested. The resulting "Montgomery Affair" was described by the British as the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Riot.

As the Quebec Act alienated the Quebec City merchants, Quebec's population was decimated by the smallpox epidemic of 1775–1776, which began in Boston, where rumours of the War of the American Revolution were being disseminated. The British had sent soldiers to Boston during the French and Indian War and it was from Boston that news of the outbreak of war was received. Quebec was abandoned by the British and fell to the revolutionaries.

French colonization in Nova Scotia

Governor Edward Cornwallis's New Brunswick Colony was the first attempt to establish a British colony in the region. This project failed in 1749, when an alliance of Indians destroyed the colony's fort. The French took advantage of this disaster to extend their own possessions on the bay and along the river. They established Fort Beauséjour on the Isthmus of Chignecto in 1755, the first major building in the region. In 1757, they formed the fortification Fort Young on the present site of Young's Cove. They also reestablished the old Fort Cumberland. They were able to hold out against the British long enough to sell most of the peninsula to the British in 1760. The French remained at Annapolis Royal until 1762.
