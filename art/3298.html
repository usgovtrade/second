He will have surgery at the end of this week in Chicago.

“I am sorry to everyone who is going through this pain right now. I would like to take this opportunity to personally apologize for any negative influence I had on the team this year. I am beyond disappointed that I contributed to an outcome like this, and for that I am truly sorry,” he wrote on Instagram.

His injury means he will be sidelined for all of the postseason, which opens on Friday with an elimination game against Orlando in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Heat lost in six games to the Magic earlier this season.

“There is no place for this in the league. It needs to end now,” Richardson wrote. “Injuring my teammates was the hardest part about this process for me. This series is the end of an incredible high school basketball career for us all. I would like to publicly apologize to DeAndre Jordan. He is a phenomenal human being. God has truly blessed me to be able to play this game for a living. For this I am eternally grateful.”

An emotional Richardson told Dwyane Wade that he will not be playing Friday because he broke his leg when he fell on the back of his leg in Game 4 of Miami’s loss to the Magic. He left the court on a stretcher with no socks or shoes on after landing on the back of his leg and landing on his side.

Wade tweeted Monday night that Richardson is in “good spirits.”

“I’m sure it’s a very tough time, but he’s in good spirits,” Wade said. “I talked to him a little bit earlier and he seems to be doing good.”

Heat forward Chris Bosh said Friday that it is not always the most important thing to a player whether he stays with the team or moves on to another squad.

“That’s more the decision of management, your agent,” Bosh said. “But yeah, that’s a tough situation. He is definitely one of those players that could contribute so much to this team.”

The Heat were just 9-9 in games this season with Richardson in the lineup. Before his injury, Richardson was leading the team with 13.6 points and 7.9 rebounds in 37 games this season.

With the Heat’s season coming to an end, Richardson has had to face some tough personal moments. He and his wife Trayvonie celebrated the birth of their daughter Tray, who will be two years old in August.

“This was the best night of my life, and now it is time to be a bigger man and grow up,” Richardson wrote. “For all of you who are going through something similar at this moment, I know you have had many struggles in your life. I am not a psychologist, but I know the best way to get through tough times is to lean on God. He will always be the cornerstone of your family and the one who will always be by your side.”

When Richardson returns, “this whole season will be nothing compared to how God will use it,” he wrote. “I look forward to what God has in store for me in the next chapter of my life and can’t wait to see what is in store for the upcoming season.”

Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh both tweeted their thoughts after learning that Richardson’s season was over.

Man it’s so sad to hear about Lance! Words can’t explain what he’s been through, I know a big part of him felt it was his job to hold the team together through the losses & injuries and he tried his hardest but I know it’s just a sport and we all have ups & downs. He’s done a lot for our team and put us in a position to win a championship so it’s disappointing to see him go through this but all of us will be there to support him the best way we can. I was with him last night & he seemed to be doing good, he has such a strong faith & is stronger than anyone I know & that’s what gets him through everything so I’m just proud of him. I was thinking this morning what if Lance would’ve stayed healthy & we’d be playing these playoffs? We’d probably be watching the rest of these playoffs from home, so I’m glad he went out the way he did, playing the way he did. RIP Lance – thank you for what you did for us #CULTURE

I was just telling @Shaquille and me what a true example he was to us young guys and our youth league and how much we could learn from him and other veterans and his maturity on and off the court when he was the only guy who had both and didn’t have to choose. So blessed to have known him over the years. — Dwyane Wade (@DwyaneWade) April 15, 2018

Wade and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra both said they were not sure what the future would hold for Richardson, but that it would be business as usual for the forward.

“I’ll just leave it where it is,” Wade said of Richardson’s future. “I’ll always be there for him. I won’t text him, I’ll call him and let him know I love him. But I think we’re going to support him through this because he’s our brother and we’re going to go through it with him.”

Spoelstra said he was disappointed for Richardson and his teammates, but that he was happy for the player.

“We went through a lot of challenges, a lot of adversity, a lot of things we couldn’t control. Unfortunately we could control one thing and that was our health,” he said. “We came up short. And our friend Lance. There are a lot of things Lance could’ve done differently, but Lance never wanted anything but to be the best he could be for his teammates.”

Spoelstra said he hoped that Richardson would return next season, and when that is “if it happens.”

Spoelstra said he would take the loss hard because of Richardson’s presence in the team and that he was a good person.

“This has nothing to do with his basketball skills. This has to do with him and who he is,” Spoelstra said. “Lance is a great person.”

Wade said it was unfortunate that Richardson had to end his season early.

“We could have been going through this without his injury. But all things work together for the good, right?” he said. “So I pray he goes through this great recovery and continue to do the work he needs to do as far as therapy, rehabilitation, whatever is going to help him get back</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:56
