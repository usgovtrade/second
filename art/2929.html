<pksadiq> !bot > Guest79272
<ubottu> Guest79272, please see my private message
<nathan_> Can anyone help me with an issue that I'm having with my touchpad and Compiz in 9.04?
<pksadiq> !ask > Guest79272
<ubottu> Guest79272, please see my private message
<Guest79272> how come?
<lilzeus> How can I install to another partition/hard drive?
<pksadiq> Guest79272: I think there is a problem with your bot
<sahil_> i have downloaded virtual box.deb file using apt-get install ./Vbox.deb, but when i try to run it using /usr/share/applications/virtualbox.desktop it says "there was an error launching the application". Why is that?
<fccf> lilzeus: please explain more clearly, install what to what
<Guest79272> it has been a while since I have used a bot
<Guest79272> it just says !bot > user
<Slart> sahil_: you need sudo when running something from a deb file.. ie.. sudo /usr/share/applications/virtualbox.desktop
<Guest79272> and bot has been removed from here
<Guest79272> so why did it answer me?
<Nitrodist> because you need to specify the user :D
<Guest79272> so how do I do that?
<Slart> Guest79272: do you actually want an irc-bot?
<pksadiq> sahil_: the .deb packages are for debian based system, but ubuntu has an apt command for installing
<sahil_> Slart: well it worked after i put sudo infront of it, so thanks
<lilzeus> fccf: I have a 1 TB HDD, but I would like to put my /home and /var/www on another partition...I read the wiki, but nothing about adding a separate /home, like how can I edit /etc/fstab so I can do that?
<fccf> lilzeus: sudo blkid and add that partition to fstab
<Slart> sahil_: you're welcome
<Guest79272> I like this bot but i have had him for so long that I wanted to remove him from here
<Nitrodist> pksadiq, ubuntu has APT and Synaptic
<Guest79272> thanks
<Nitrodist> !apt
<ubottu> APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome), !Adept (KDE) or !KPackageKit (KDE)
<pksadiq> Nitrodist: so what is the difference between apt and synaptic?
<lilzeus> fccf: how do I do that from a live disk?
<Guest79272> pksadiq: do you know anything about bots?
<vick> what is the difference between a proxy server and vpn
<pksadiq> Guest79272: yes, but too much to explain
<Slart> vick: proxy server?
<pksadiq> Nitrodist: please go to #ubuntu-offtopic for this discussion ;)
<Nitrodist> pksadiq, nothign
<fccf> lilzeus: it doesn't matter if you are using a live disk or the real thing... what version of ubuntu are you running
<Slart> vick: proxy is a regular computer somewhere, running a special application which can do all kinds of things..
<Nitrodist> vick, vpn is network tunneling
<Slart> vick: a proxy is usually used to let people go through without actually knowing your true IP address
<lilzeus> fccf: I am using 9.04 on a USB stick
<pksadiq> Nitrodist: just wanted to know that, so what is the difference between synaptic and apt?
<fccf> lilzeus: ok what partition do you want to edit? and how much space do you want to devote to /home
<ChogyDan> sahil_: I remember that issue, but I had to restart the computer for it to work.  I don't remember what else was involved
<nathan_> Can anyone help me with an issue that I'm having with my touchpad and Compiz in 9.04?
<Nitrodist> pksadiq, apt and synaptic is the same thing with different GUIs
<Slart> vick: you want to see if we are online? =)
<vick> Slart, ah...
<lilzeus> fccf: I want to edit my swap...it is a very small swap, it needs to be 1.5 GB instead of 1 GB...how do I do that from a live cd?
<fccf> lilzeus: 1.5gb - swap .. is a lot and the rest of the drive is /home ... just install to that 1.5gig and it should resize for you
<pksadiq> Nitrodist: oh, so then, synaptic has more features right?
<Nitrodist> pksadiq, yes
<lilzeus> fccf: 1 GB should be enough, right?
<Nitrodist> pksadiq, well, you could install synaptic and it would have more features... that is why i told you to go to #ubuntu-offtopic ;)
<sahil_> pksadiq: yup it seems to work now...thanks anyways for ur help
<fccf> lilzeus: I have 3 gigs and it is fine
<pksadiq> sahil_: are you trying to launch that application using ./VBox ?
<Nitrodist> pksadiq, synaptic is the software installer from gnome. use 'software-center'
<ChogyDan> Slart: I'm not really sure what the question is...
<lilzeus> fccf: but is that the max size that a swap can be?
<Slart> ChogyDan: =)
<lilzeus> fccf: I would really hate to run out of space
<pksadiq> sahil_: if so, first put sudo before it and if it has arguments too put " sudo /....."
<ChogyDan> lilzeus: maybe try a swap file instead
<fccf> lilzeus: yes
<pksadiq> Nitrodist: oops, I started it from the command line and now would like to use GUI ;))
<sahil_> pksadiq: no i don't have vbox installed but i have downloaded the file and it worked fine with ./Vbox.deb
<lilzeus> ChogyDan: what is a swap file?
<lilzeus> ChogyDan: or is it a swap partition?
<fccf> lilzeus: I am thinking that you need to make /home 2 gig, or whatever it takes
<pksadiq> sahil_: the .deb file is a deb package that might require dependencies to be satisfied before using it
<Slart> ChogyDan: ah.. I remember.. there was this other guy with the same problem.. he had some kind of custom ubuntu install and I think it didn't work well with network proxies or something.. he removed the proxy, updated, ran the installer again and it worked.. some kind of weird network setup I guess
<ChogyDan> lilzeus: swap files are like ram.  If you get low on swap, it will swap out RAM to swap file
<Nitrodist> pksadiq, yes, but when you install synaptic, you can add, remove, mark, etc using gui :)
<Slart> ChogyDan: might be wrong about the last part though.. but it seemed like that's what happened
<ChogyDan> lilzeus: swap files can be dynamic, i.e. resizable as needed
<sahil_> pksadiq: i see...
<ChogyDan> Slart: yeah, this was the result of what Slart said
<lilzeus> fccf: yes, I have a 1 GB swap now and would like it to be 1.5 GB instead
<jimi_hendrix> what is a good place to download/get mp3s with linux?
<ChogyDan> Slart: I was thinking of another guy with the same issue, but that one didn't have a swap file at all, just a swap partition
<jimi_hendrix> i cant find vidalia
<Slart> ChogyDan: oh.. ok
<lilzeus> ChogyDan: so a swap file is exactly the same as</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:54
