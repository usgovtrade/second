This song was used in the ABC Family television show Greek during the second season. It was also performed by Benny Boom in his music video "The Way We Was".

It has also appeared in various trailers for television series such as "Bionic Woman", "NCIS", "Cold Case", "House", and "Grey's Anatomy".  It has also been used in the films The Secret Life of the American Teenager and Step Up 2: The Streets, and in various trailers for films, such as Sex and the City.

The song has also been performed by actress Brooke Shields. During her 2008 MTV Spring Break performance, a man fell off the back of a boat and drowned, causing an uproar in the audience. As a result, Brooke stopped the show in order to console and apologize to the people. Then she started singing "I'm a Little Bit Country" in order to cheer them up.

In 2008, "I'm a Little Bit Country" was used in a viral video titled "Viral Guns", which satirized gun control protests.

Rachel Uchitel used it in the beginning of a scene on her reality TV show, Dirty Sexy Money, on Oxygen. It can also be heard in the pilot of FX's series Lights Out.

In January 2009, "I'm a Little Bit Country" was used in a viral video called "The Best of Me" by comedian Andy Milonakis on Saturday Night Live.

A cover of the song by American folk singer Lori McKenna was included on the album All That We Needed (2007), from the TV series Grey's Anatomy. The song is also used in the opening title of Grey's Anatomy and other shows.

In 2015 the song was used in a Tampax tampon advertisement.
