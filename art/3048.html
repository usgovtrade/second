"We'll put a few cans in the cooler, and we try to save enough to get us a few hours' supply so the two of us can go out and do some more of our things.

"We are kind of keeping up with the law as much as we can, which I know is hard to do."

He said he still believes that having a gun for hunting will keep you alive if you ever need it.

I said, 'Man, can you imagine?' he said, 'you think when you are down there the law would care if you had a gun?'"

Chambers and his family live at a location off of Ditch Road and he has noticed more and more people carrying guns since the law was passed.

He said he is happy to see that.

"I like that people are standing up. I wouldn't want to see nobody messing with them; when somebody's got a gun you should be able to see that. If you don't, something's wrong with them," Chambers said.

Chambers is still very protective of the land his family owns and is fearful that someone will come out and harm his livestock or even kill the animals.

Chambers has a number of deer and turkey that feed on his land and is fearful that if the law was changed that his land would be taken by the state and another family would move in.

I asked how he would feel if he could no longer keep his animals on his land.

He replied: "That is not even an option."

Chambers' land can be seen from the main road of Main Street in Denton, which runs along Ditch Road.

In the months since the legislation passed the Chambers family has become one of the most visible families that has openly embraced the legislation.

Holly Chambers is a licensed nurse that volunteers her time at a local nursing home.

The family is known for openly hunting on their land with a number of deer visible on their property and no signs or flags to indicate that they are using the land.

A sign in the Chambers driveway reads: "If you do not have respect for your children then you don't have them."

A number of deer can be seen lying in the fields off the Chambers property that lead to Ditch Road and the family is always on the lookout for other hunters to ensure they do not trespass and kill Chambers' animals.

Since the passage of the new law that allows gun owners to carry guns into gun-free zones such as public buildings and the grounds of schools, sports complexes, churches, etc., it has been the Chambers family that has become the most visible to the general public and they have no problem telling anyone that they are the first residents of Denton County to openly carry a firearm and legally hunt in their own yards.

"I wouldn't mind not going out and hunting, but then I am also helping the land out," he said.

"I want to leave my property better than I found it. I have had a lot of deer come into our property and leave their heads lying around the yard.

"You have to get your guns out there and hunt because in some cases that is the only thing they will see."

He also said he carries a revolver on his belt in case he needs to protect himself.

"If something happens, we are not going to stay on the ground," he said.

"We are going to stand up and fight back."

Chambers added that he has tried to keep up with his own gun license and carries one in case he ever needs to use it.

He said he has no problems with guns, but added: "There are a few things you just have to watch out for."

He said in his opinion that only law enforcement personnel should carry firearms.

"Police officers and sheriff's department people should be able to carry it. That is who you are dealing with. We need to help out the law, and if you are not doing it to protect yourself, then I don't see why they should have it," Chambers said.

Randy Chambers said he feels that the state legislature will allow people to carry guns within 150 feet of a building such as schools or churches, as long as the guns are out of the reach of those people.

However, Chambers said he wants to have more than a sign on his property stating that he is within 150 feet of a building.

He said he thinks the state legislators will begin working on the issue to allow gun owners to carry guns within 150 feet of a person, but so far no one has made that suggestion to him.

But Chambers said he has noticed that schools in Denton County do not even post signs to indicate they are gun-free zones because they fear parents and people who have guns will shoot a parent or teacher.

Chambers said that he has friends that are teachers at school that can't even carry a gun because of the law.

He said: "If I was going to take my guns on, I would take them everywhere I go, as long as I have them on me, just for me to be safe.

"So I hope one day we can get back in public so we can carry guns just like we carry our hands," he said.

As a result of the gun legislation a number of gun shops have sprung up across the county and Randy Chambers says they are very busy at all times with people seeking a gun license.

He said he had a friend that went out and got a concealed handgun permit in Arizona after the Arizona shooting and there were over 300,000 people that attempted to get their permit in one week.

"This has been a bad week so far. People that don't usually come in are all the way here," Chambers said.

Randy Chambers said that he has never known of anyone to shoot someone at one of the sporting events at the Denton High School, but he is also aware that it can happen.

"People are out there looking for things to do. I hear from other hunters saying they are doing a lot of spot shooting now. You have to keep your eyes out," Chambers said.

He said that he and his wife are involved in a lot of organizations and have a lot of friends, so he does not plan on keeping guns in his house.

"The first thing is your doors are not going to be locked," he said.

"We are not going to go and live in the mountains so you don't have to worry about anyone shooting at you. That is just not going to happen."

Randy Chambers said he is waiting to see if the legislature will open another round of gun legislation.

At the end of our interview Chambers said: "We need to be more aware of who we are dealing with."

"I do want to see someone with a concealed handgun license coming up here to shoot me and see what happens," he said.

"People are coming down here all the time shooting their guns. One thing I do not want to have happen is for someone to shoot me and then when the law takes it that we don't have a gun, or I didn't have a gun. It is still their fault," Chambers said.

The gun legislation, called Senate Bill 11 in the Texas House of Representatives and House Bill 242 in the Texas Senate, gives each member of the legislature a lifetime pass to carry a concealed handgun on school campuses and public buildings. The laws now need to pass through the two chambers of the legislature to become law.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:06
