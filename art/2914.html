While the past few years have not been the easiest to weather, if there’s one thing fans can bank on, it’s that the team will keep a positive outlook going forward. The organization’s focus will now shift to strengthening the roster and making the most of this next opportunity to return to the playoffs.

That would be a tall task for even the most dedicated of teams, and one that many would deem unlikely considering the current roster situation. That fact is highlighted in an article from The Athletic’s Michael Russo.

The Athletic’s Michael Russo recently wrote an article exploring the current landscape of this roster, which is both a positive and a negative when it comes to the organization. On the negative side, it points out that there are many ways the roster could improve, but it’s unlikely. On the positive side, it points out that the club’s focus remains as it always has been, which is competing to win on an annual basis.

The current roster may not have a lot of “star power,” as one could label Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin or any other name with that designation, but it does have a lot of potential on that front, and the focus of the entire organization should be on making the most of that fact.

The current state of the roster, as a whole, has been very positive for the Rockets. The organization made the difficult decision to trade Chris Paul and keep the franchise still moving forward. It’s hard to say how many seasons were at risk of being ruined, but no one was more at risk than Harden and Co. The hope is that not many people see this version of the roster as much of an improvement, as the team in its current form will continue to remain competitive.

If there is one good thing to take away from the article is that regardless of how long the franchise and its management remain patient, ultimately they will take on the form of this roster as a starting point. It’s not a guarantee the team will win a championship, but the organization always had a belief that this group, no matter how bad the season looked like to observers, could turn things around.

The roster appears to be heading in a positive direction, and the organization should be looking to put together one of its best team in years. The future is always filled with uncertainty, but there is one thing we can always count on, and that’s to remain optimistic.
