# Foreword

As someone who has watched the home barbecue market develop in the past twenty years, from early backyard grill-builders and charcoal grill kits to the modern era of pellet smoker grills, I have seen this market grow rapidly in the number of products available and the variety of accessories. The outdoor cooking industry has responded to this demand for more and more features and made it easier to grill and smoke meat and fish with less fat and more flavor. In fact, while I am a proponent of traditional outdoor cooking over an open fire, one thing you will not find here is a traditional recipe for any one of these outdoor cookers. The world of outdoor cooking products has become an increasingly unique and diverse place over the past several years.

I will say that this book can also be enjoyed by people who are just wanting a backyard cooker to get them started with smoking meat. Grill Grates are a great product that will expand what you can cook. I have friends who can't build a charcoal grill in their backyards and have an electric grill. Grill Grates allow them to smoke meats with a minimal amount of effort and create great smoke flavor.

Justin Spicer, who is the designer and creator of Grill Grates, also believes in this very ethos. So while Grill Grates are a great product, I am surprised that the first book by him and his company covers just the Grill Grate. It seems that this is just the beginning of a huge line of outdoor cooking products and a wide variety of smokers for those who are interested in turning their backyard or deck into a professional-grade smoker. I can't wait to see how he expands this great product line to fit a variety of grilling needs.

And that's just one reason why I am so excited about this new cookbook. It provides the detailed information you need to get started with the Grill Grate in a way that you will be able to enjoy an outdoor experience, including eating the fruits of your labor, that is better than you thought was possible.

# Introduction: A Grilling Odyssey—Beginning with Grill Grates

I am writing this book from the heart of the great outdoors—at my family's summer home on Lake Erie. In the evening, the skies can be filled with the sound of thunder as it rolls over this magnificent lake. When the skies clear, the stars seem to shine bright above me and the moon is a silver orb that gives warmth to the landscape. When the moon is full, you can see it from horizon to horizon. The stars shine against a backdrop of trees on the bluff to my left and the night sky above that. I have a panoramic view of the moon's reflection on the lake and over the water to the trees along the opposite shoreline. This place has everything: woods, mountains, ponds, and lake, all surrounded by a huge forest of oaks. You can find plenty of wildlife and many places to be by a blaze on a grate.

There is not much I have done in life that compares to the thrill of spending time outdoors. I love to come out of my office and go fishing for crappie in the late spring and early summer. I enjoy casting a light spinning rod in early season and later in the season taking a heavy spinning rod and catching huge bass. I am also a master at ice fishing for pike and perch, and I enjoy the challenge of pulling them in. I enjoy being in the outdoors as much as I can; it's my life. I have been a professional barbecue chef since 2003, and I started smoking in 2003. I enjoy cooking and smoking my meats, and I love spending time outside in the great outdoors. The more barbecue joints I get to see, the more I enjoy it. But it's not just my life, it is my brother's, and it's his friends. We are always talking about food and outdoor cooking.

We grill all the time at his house—almost every weekend we have dinner. I grill and smoke my own meat and fish and love to get more people to understand the excitement of smoking meat and grilling and the flavor it gives. I am not just into grilling meats and fish and other foods, I am into smoking. Grilling and smoking is such an art. The grills are made of all kinds of materials—wood, charcoal, gas, or electric. There is all kinds of fuel that you can use—charcoal, propane, wood, natural gas, and electricity. The materials for grills are endless and you can use them to take your grilling, smoking, and outdoor cooking to another level. This book is all about grilling and smoking and sharing the tools I have used to find what is right for me, and I hope you get the same enjoyment from the grill as I do.

—J. Spicer

I am a professional chef who learned to cook at my family's farm in Indiana. I've been a professional cook for twenty-eight years. I have been smokin' and grillin' for longer than I want to remember. I met Justin Spicer in 2009. Justin contacted me about this product, about grill grates, and I immediately recognized the difference his product would make. We talked on the phone for a while and I shared my passion for this project. Justin has a passion for his business, and he and I just clicked on our first encounter. I felt I understood his vision and his idea, and I can relate to it. I also love the fact that he is a student of life.

I loved cooking on charcoal grills when I was young, and that's how I cook. We would go out to the yard and cook the steaks and burgers and fish on charcoal grills. We didn't have fancy contraptions, but we did have charcoal and grates. One thing I have never understood is why people are afraid to cook outside on the grill. The smell of smoking food is pure. The aromas, the sounds, the sights—what else is there in life that is so wonderful? It's hard to find those same smells in a restaurant or a grocery store.

Justin's vision for the grill grate is unique. He has taken a very simple design and elevated it to the next level. It's beautiful, it's easy, and it's great for the backyard cook. In addition, he is helping people smoke and grill with no wood boxes or smokers. Now you can smoke as much as you want to—which is all I ever wanted to do.

I knew this was going to be a hit because of its simplicity. The best-selling models are the Premium model and the Ultimate models. Justin and I have developed this book together to explain the history of our product and answer any questions you may have about cooking on a grill grate. This book will change the way you look at and cook on grates.

# Foreword

I am a big Grill Grates supporter because they are great tools for anyone who likes to cook outdoors. I have grill grates in several places in my house. I cook a lot and they are a great addition to any grill. The first thing I got was a Grill Grates pizza grill. This is a very unique pizza grilling experience. I really enjoy using grill grates to cook on. They make everything taste so good. They will be perfect for many people who may have a small grill or might not have the funds to invest in an expensive brand new grill. It is important to use the right type of wood for the kind of flavor you are looking for. You don't have to worry about spilling anything because of the grates. The grill grates can help to keep the grease and the splatters and makes cleanup very easy. With grill grates you can cook meat and vegetables on the grill grate. You can also do some other cooking stuff such as cooking pizza, meat, fish, and vegetables at the same time. I like to use the grill grates to smoke out when I am cooking for a couple of different reasons. This is a fun experience. I love the results and the smell it produces. The smell just makes everything taste better. Once you try this you will see what I mean. I don't smoke out or grill with a chimney, I</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:23
