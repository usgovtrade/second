on the principles of a government, by the choice of the people.
The people have indeed made the choice; but it has been made without
reason, from a total misconception of the subject. The American
constitutions have erected no such extensive and magnificent fabrics as
that which has been proposed by this writer. They have done more--they
have abolished the state governments, and erected a national one--but
the powers of the national legislature have never yet exceeded those of
the state legislature. This plan goes to erect one national government,
under which all the states are to be entirely swallowed up. By thus
governing, what will be the advantage of this union? What is the motive
that obliges these men to unite for such distant purposes, and to enter
into such extensive engagements? What is it that obliges them to support
government at all? To protect the people against a foreign invasion
is the whole extent of the business. Against a foreign invasion, the
national army and navy is alone competent. The states do not pay into
the national treasury; they are not bound in any shape or form to
pay any thing to the United States. In what sense, therefore, are they
involuntary parties in the transactions of government? If the state
legislatures are not only bound, but that they must do everything which
the national legislature requires them to do; if the state governments
are not only to be bound by the acts of Congress, but that those acts
must be executed by the officers of the states; it is impossible that
this Congress, or any Congress, should have any power, and that the
governments of the states can be made efficient. If the government of
the union is to be supreme, and that of the state governments subordinate
to it, let us have a direct proof of it. Let us see, if the supremacy of
the national government is necessary to give life, energy, and efficacy
to the state governments. On the contrary, I see no necessity for such a
confederation, or any necessity for governments or parties, because there
is a natural right existing in the people which is sufficient to form
the government of themselves. The people are perfectly competent,
and competent to every thing that relates to their government. They
are also under the necessity of exercising the functions of this
government; otherwise they must live a state of vassalage. There are
certain things which are common to men and nations, and these the people
have an equal right to in any manner they may think proper; as to their
particular situation and circumstances, they may always alter them, in
order to suit their purpose. They may enlarge or abridge their government,
and give or take powers in such a manner as to them shall seem best
calculated to form them the happiest people on earth. They may change
their form of government, whenever it shall be found necessary, or proper
to do so. As to external objects, such as defence against an invasion,
which at present is the only cause of the existence of governments, the
people are equally competent to exercise the government of themselves,
without the interposition of any national government whatever. There is
no necessity that the people should unite for this purpose, nor that any
one should employ others to do this work. It is true that an invasion may
be made upon a nation in the midst of its government, and that government
may be totally destroyed before the people can unite in defence of it. In
such a case, a government may become necessary, and the best way to form
it will be to consult the people, in order to discover what is necessary
and proper for their defence. If it should be found that the inhabitants
of the invaded nation are not capable of or ready to exercise this
government, and if they should be unable to make proper application to
the powers for their defense, the people in such a case must have recourse
to means of defence, which I have before mentioned, and that is to employ
the public forces, or to form a provisional government for themselves.
The inhabitants of a country, then, in the situation that I have here
mentioned, cannot possibly be without a government, because the necessity
will force them to be so. They have either public or private means of
self-defense, and in either case will make use of these for their own
protection. But still it is as true as it is little known to the people
that their government will not be oppressive. They will not suffer a
military force to exercise the powers of their government, but will have
recourse to the old and purest form of government. Whenever they have
recourse to such a government, they will have it only for their defence.
In this manner, then, the people will form a government for themselves,
without any interference of the national legislature; and whenever they
have occasion for it, they will use it for their defence, and the people
cannot be oppressed or endangered by this provisional government.

From these observations, it appears that a state of war, or a war in a
state of peace, is not a necessity for the existence of government. It is
therefore impossible that a government that is formed by the consent of
the people, and for their own defense, should ever become necessary. It
is absurd, to suppose that it is ever necessary. The existence of a state
of war proves this to be absurd, because it destroys the principle on
which all governments are constituted. If it was a natural necessity
that government should exist at all, it will exist without any necessity
on the part of the people. The people are then under no necessity of
providing for their own government; because it is never necessary. There
is a necessity for defending the nation from foreign invasion, but there
is not a necessity for a government. The people cannot be supposed to be
able to defend themselves, unless they are so far acquainted with the
affairs of government as to be able to form an adequate government for
their own protection. The inhabitants of a country, then, when a foreign
invasion is apprehended, must consult the powers of their government to
see whether the same is equal to the emergency; for without government
they cannot defend themselves. This proves that they are as competent as
any other people for providing for their own safety, and it is absurd to
say that they are unable to do it, because they have not any government
or power to exercise. It is equally absurd to say that the people are
under a necessity of constituting a government, and that they are
unable to protect themselves without it. It is not necessary that the
government should be permanent, nor does a long continuance of any
government produce any other effect than to prove that the people
have conferred on it a power sufficient to accomplish the end for which
it is established; as a nation, it shall continue until this power is
abolished by a change of circumstances; if it shall be again abolished
by an invasion, the same proofs will make another government necessary,
until the nation shall be sufficiently exercised in defence to be able to
accomplish all the necessary purposes of government. These observations
will also apply to a situation that might arise in any number of
individuals, as in case a small number of people were to be attacked
by an enemy in any of the situations here mentioned, and were to be
unable to defend themselves, it would be necessary that others should
come to their assistance, and that in the mean time they should be
united by some mutual engagements and arrangements, to secure their
rights. A state of war is therefore no more a necessary event in the
operation of government than it is in the affairs of individuals.

When this constitution is proposed to the people of this country, they
will of course take time for reflection and examination. The powers of
government are proposed to be unlimited; and no distinction will be
made between the powers of government and the rights of citizens. The
people are never more disposed to exercise the right of remonstrance, and
it must be exercised at the very first onset. Every exercise of power that
is not founded on the common right of all, must be in opposition to
it. Nothing but universal consent can support it, and this will never
be obtained, for it is not a right which governments are inclined to
concede. I believe that there are few who will object to the idea of
government, or doubt that such as it is, ought to exist in the world. The
object of government is to secure the rights of the people, and no other
than that; and in this view the constitution is calculated to effect that
very purpose, and the people will therefore be disposed to avail
themselves of it as soon as they are fairly informed of the advantages
they may expect to receive. The great end will be attained, and every man
will have the fullest liberty in the conduct of the government, and the
most unlimited privileges of acquiring riches. Let me entreat you to
consider this matter coolly, and to look at the rights of all men, but
more especially at the privileges of America. If we compare the country
with any other in Europe we must be convinced that there never was a
more suitable country for such an enterprise; and I appeal to America to
convince any one who may think otherwise.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:53
