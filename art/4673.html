Following through on his pledge to "bring back jobs" to America, Trump is set to sign an executive order that would allow TransCanada to start building the controversial pipeline. The order would make the permit given to the company for the Keystone XL pipeline active again, which Trump has delayed since taking office.

In a speech from the Oval Office on Monday, Trump pledged that he would make good on his pledge to American workers who were promised work building a pipeline that would have transported 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Alberta, Canada to refineries in Port Arthur, Texas.

Trump's order comes after he received a letter from TransCanada on January 24 informing the President of its intent to start the process of replacing the cross-border permit with an export permit. In its letter, TransCanada said that because the President signed executive orders mandating the pipeline be built with U.S. steel and the completion of the Keystone XL would boost the economy by creating thousands of jobs.

"Since TransCanada's most recent application, our nation has realized more than 150,000 energy-related job and $8 billion in economic activity," reads TransCanada's letter to the President.

TransCanada also noted that the cross-border permit had "lapsed" on May 31 and that if it was not renewed the company would need to reapply and "there would be no guarantee that such an application would be approved."

TransCanada President and CEO Russ Girling told CNN that the presidential executive order would expedite the approval process of the permit from roughly 10-12 months to just a few months.

Trump's executive order in response to TransCanada's letter can be viewed below.

A spokesperson for the company told CNN that the permit will allow TransCanada to begin a re-application process for the Keystone XL pipeline.

On its official Twitter account, Trump posted a message saying he will "sign his Presidential Permit today."

The State Department denied a permit for the cross-border portion of the pipeline in November 2015 and later, in February 2017, said it was in a legal "holding pattern" on the permit while the U.S. government decided whether to allow the pipeline to go forward.

"While we are awaiting a final decision from the United States, we continue to implement our project, while we wait," Girling said in an earnings call with financial analysts on Wednesday.

TransCanada said in its letter to the President that its approval process will follow US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines "to ensure the Keystone XL project protects air, water and land, as the EIS describes."

It added that "the EIS concluded there would be minimal impacts on land, water, and wetlands and little to no impact on wildlife and greenhouse gas emissions."

The approval process has been controversial, with some people in Nebraska claiming the Trump administration is looking to approve the controversial pipeline that would transport crude oil from Alberta to Texas -- including critics of the project.

When asked about reports that one pipeline company had asked TransCanada to take on a bigger role in the approval process of the Keystone XL, Girling told CNN that "we have had productive, ongoing discussions with our shipper and will continue to engage with them going forward."

"At the same time, we will engage with the government on a case-by-case basis as required," Girling added.

This is the third time Trump has delayed TransCanada's pipeline. The President first made the delay public in March 2017. It was the second time he had put a delay on the pipeline project.

In November 2015, he vowed to make the U.S. renegotiate the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- in addition to canceling pending trade deals with Asian nations. Those comments were later followed by the launch of TransCanada's proposed Energy East Pipeline.

Trump's first attempt to save the project in January 2017 was stymied by the courts after TransCanada decided to voluntarily pause the permit review.

On March 23, 2017, Trump sent a presidential memorandum to the U.S. Commerce Department directing it to conduct a national interest determination to review the project under the National Environmental Policy Act. It is unclear how that process will progress.

CNN asked for comment from the Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State and the State Department about the Keystone XL pipeline's approval process.

The Department of Justice told CNN it "cannot confirm or deny whether a decision to approve the permit has been made." The Department of Commerce, State Department and Transportation referred CNN to the White House for comment.

The Department of Transportation told CNN, "The Trump administration looks forward to reviewing and making a decision on any applications."

The White House referred CNN to Girling and said the administration is preparing to make the permit approval public.

"If and when it goes public, it will be a full public review," a spokesperson for Girling said.

The Keystone XL is expected to start production next year, once operational.

"This order would accelerate the building of this cross-border pipeline to create thousands of jobs," Trump said during his speech in the Oval Office.

Girling told CNN on Tuesday he believes the Keystone XL project could be built in three years.

On Wednesday, he told CNN the White House will need to sign an "executive order that basically waives any other environmental process that is going to be in there."

"We are very excited about that. We are ready to get started," Girling said.

He added the Keystone XL "is not a complicated project. We understand the regulations and we know how to navigate them. We've done this before."

The fate of the Keystone XL has become a political hot potato as some Republicans in Congress were looking to boost oil production in North Dakota and Montana. The Canadian government supported the project but the Alberta premier raised concerns the project would decrease profits for oil companies.

A recent poll from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago found that only 39% of Americans support building the pipeline. The poll found 72% of Americans think the project "would have either a negative impact on the economy or no impact at all."

A federal judge in Montana last month issued a stay blocking construction of the Keystone XL. The stay does not stop TransCanada from receiving the State Department permit. However, it puts on hold the judge's ruling that would block TransCanada from cutting down trees and potentially harming landowners and wildlife.

Trump's executive order may not result in a quick return for TransCanada to the construction of the Keystone XL. The company will need to apply for a new permit from the State Department and undergo an environmental impact statement review -- all things TransCanada has already done.

The company will likely also face an environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:03
