Rearing live food fish in aquariums

Care of amphibians and reptiles

Manuals on caring for these animals are available through Aquatic Tanks

The purpose of this Manual is to provide information on the care of the different species of fishes kept in home aquariums and other small bodies of water by aquarists.

Although every effort is made to give the best advice, it should be remembered that all fish are individuals and each individual fish will have individual needs. Therefore the best advice is provided by trial and error.

One of the big differences between fish keeping and general household pets is that the aim of fish keeping is the breeding of the fish. A fish is not considered a pet in the same way that a cat or dog is. If you wish to keep fish as pets you should look at keeping reptiles instead of fish.

Types of fish

There are several different types of fish in which you may wish to keep:

The first type are reef fish, and the most common of these is the clownfish or lionfish. This fish is usually kept with a single, very large anemone.

The next type are tropical freshwater fish. All of these are tropical, and can all be kept in an aquarium. These tropical freshwater fish are easy to keep and care is not too onerous.

The next type are saltwater tropical fish. These fish have the same requirements as the tropical freshwater fish but have to be kept in a saltwater aquarium.

The next type of fish are the poikilotherms. These fish are cold water species which come from all over the world and can survive and thrive in almost any environment.

The last group are the homeotherms. These fish are the same in the same way as tropical freshwater fish, but have to be kept in a different type of aquarium. They include the goldfish, guppy, snakehead, and the betta.

You will find that most hobbyists have two aquariums in which to keep their fish, the home aquarium, which is a large tank and the breeding aquarium.

Breeding

The only real necessity in breeding fish is adequate numbers of fish, so the most important thing for someone starting in fish keeping is to find some way of obtaining fish. A small aquarium will not be suitable for breeding fish, and you may need to look at large aquaria and/or aquaculture facilities. If you are able to breed your own fish then you can keep them to ensure a steady supply. If you decide to buy fish from suppliers, it is generally considered good practice to buy more than you think you will need.

The other essential requirement in breeding is temperature. All fish that are bred for aquaria have to be kept within a fairly narrow temperature range. They should not be bred in a room that is too hot or too cold. Fish have a relatively poor tolerance to changes in water temperature.

Breeding your own fish will enable you to be sure of the sex of the fish, as you are able to control the hatching of the eggs. If you decide to buy your fish from suppliers, remember that they may not always be accurately sexed. Some fish will have their sex determined by the colour pattern or markings on the fins.

The conditions in which fish breed should not be too complicated. A home aquarium is not suitable for breeding, as there should be room for the fry to grow and the parents to rest. The fry will grow to adult size within five months if they are fed at least twice daily. At the start of the breeding process you need to ensure that the fish are not fed until the fry are about to hatch, and for a period of five days after this.

You should put two to three inches of gravel at the bottom of the aquarium, and put in some aquarium plant material. Many hobbyists breed their fish in planted tanks which have large areas of plants overhanging the sides of the tank. In addition to providing shade and hiding places for the eggs, this can help to maintain the water temperature. Eggs are fertilised naturally within the body of the female fish. The female lays up to 300-400 eggs which are stuck to the gravel in the bottom of the tank. The eggs sink to the bottom of the tank where they are fertilized. The shell of the egg has two layers. Once fertilized the first layer of the shell bursts, allowing the other layers of the shell to be split apart. The remaining layers then fall away. The unfertilised eggs will still break at the outer layer and the pieces will fall to the bottom of the tank. The fertilised eggs will stay whole and remain at the surface. They can be identified by their bright colour and oval shape. The length of time taken for the shell to hatch varies with the temperature. At about 10°C the hatch takes about four days; at 18°C it is about five days.

Hatching

When the eggs are ready to be picked up with a sieve, or net, you should put a mesh over the surface of the tank and under the mesh in the bottom. Under the mesh is the area in which the eggs are hatched. You will find that there are some bubbles on the bottom of the tank. These will disappear in about an hour. During this time the water will become clearer and the surface of the water will appear to become slightly lighter. There may be some movement of the water in the tank, but it should not be rapid. Some of the eggs may be broken or lose their tail, but they should still be attached to the gravel.

To obtain the fish you need to pick them off with a pair of forceps. If you are careful not to break the eggs, you can catch the fry. They should be removed from the gravel so that they are not contaminated by the eggs. Small, young, fry can be fed with brine shrimp or infusoria. Older fry can be fed with a commercial pelleted food such as Tetra AquaSafe Fry.

Aquatic Tanks specialise in the supply of freshwater fish and tropical fish to South Africa.

The aquarium, or freshwater aquarium, is a common household and pet fish kept for recreational purposes. The fish which can be kept in an aquarium vary widely and include freshwater and marine species, fish from many different parts of the world, and fish of many different colors. Many of the fish that can be kept in aquaria are also commercially grown for breeding, eating or research.

Some people keep only ornamental freshwater aquarium fish, usually freshwater fish from the tropics, such as the Neotropical cichlids or the African Butterfly Fish. However, most aquarists keep both fish that are for personal use, and aquarium fish that are bred. Breeding aquarium fish, or aquarium fish for sale is a much larger commercial enterprise than keeping the fish for the aquarium as a personal hobby. Many people keep aquarium fish that are being bred for the aquarium industry. Some individuals breed their own fish in aquariums. Many hobbyists maintain fish that they breed for sale to fish dealers, pet shops and fish hobbyists.

Aquarium fish are frequently kept as pets and in some cases to feed to a family member or friend. Some individuals keep fish in public aquariums as living art in an art museum, or in a public aquarium or a museum. Many keep fish in aquariums in order to use their fins as natural "fins" to dry after washing and for display.

The most popular fish in the aquarium today is the fish and the tropical fish both belong to the same family. The fish come in all shades of colour and shape; they include freshwater fish such as catfish, freshwater and rainbowfish, goldfish, cichlids, African butterfly fish, discus fish, and so many others. Fish from the temperate regions of the world are also raised in the aquarium. Fish species such as platies and tetras are kept in the home aquarium and it is likely that you will be able to buy a wide range of these species from your fish shop.

Fish such as barracuda, large marine fish such as shark and barracuda can also be kept. Many hobbyists also keep fish from saltwater,</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:22
