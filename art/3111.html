#  Bush

The members of this Australian band were brothers-in-law, and their debut was billed as Bushwackers' Party. It was not until the release of their second single, 'Don't Start Me Talkin'', that their real name, a derivation of their family name of Stuart, came to prominence. This single was the first of a series of hit records, 'Rub It In', 'Long Time Ago', 'Put The Light On', 'Dreamin' My Dreams' and 'Get Set'. After a long absence, Bush returned in 1993 with a new album and a new crop of hit singles. The first single from the new album, 'Glycerine', was a Number 3 hit in the UK in 1994. They were also nominated for 'Best British Newcomer' at the 1995 BRIT Awards.

# Busta Rhymes

b. Trevor Smith, 12 July 1972, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA. This gifted rapper, whose career has been the subject of almost constant legal wranglings, is the son of a record shop owner, and grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn. The family moved to Philadelphia, then Washington DC when Busta was 12, and he attended high school there. He attended Howard University in Washington DC for two years, with studies abandoned after a motorbike accident which left him unconscious for nearly two years. He then moved to New York to study hip-hop music at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. At that time his ambition was to earn the respect of his peers, which meant his rapping skills, but he became a regular DJ at school parties and was quickly noticed. However, he still had some way to go: 'My cousin had a tape of DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, and we didn't know about that stuff before. That was very influential.' He got a job at Blockbuster Video and began recording his own original material. A demo was sent to L.A. producer DJ Quik, but before he could reply, the record company folded. He made one album before leaving the label.

He joined Tommy Boy Records, which was then a new company run by black-oriented music fan, Mark Ronson. Busta, who had been living in a flat in downtown Brooklyn with his grandmother, decided that he wanted to leave. 'My grandma said I was a young boy and this was the best thing for me, and that was just the motivation that she needed. She got me out of the hood. That motivated me a lot. I started paying her back in other ways, not financially.' Within a year he was head of A&R and marketing at the label. In 1989 he recorded 'Woo-Hah!! Got You All In Check' with Q-Tip and A Tribe Called Quest for the hip-hop movie _Wild Style_. It was also in 1989 that he first met Nas, although it wasn't until 1991 that the hip-hop superstar signed to Tommy Boy. After that it was full speed ahead for Busta, and it is now widely accepted that he is rap's most powerful singer/songwriter.

Trevor Smith first appeared under his new name on the 'Rush' remix (with LL Cool J and Run-DMC), before releasing his debut album, _The Coming_ , in March 1992. It went to Number 1 in the US and was certified double-platinum. It was nominated for a Grammy. The lead single, 'Woo Hah!! Got You All In Check', earned him a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance. The album was also the soundtrack to the film _Poetic Justice_ , which peaked at Number 3 in the US, and its two singles, 'Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See' (with Method Man) and 'What's The Flavor?' (with Salt-N-Pepa), reached Number 4 in the US.

After the release of _The Coming_ , Busta left Tommy Boy, citing musical differences between him and the label. He released a new solo album, _E.L.E. (Extraordinary Love Edition)_ , with his own label. It spent five weeks at the top of the US R&B album chart. 'What's My Name' was also a Top 20 hit, and the single 'Cross The Border' gave him his first solo Number 1. Busta then signed with Elektra Records, with whom he released three new albums in quick succession. _Dangerous_ hit Number 1 on the US charts in 1997.

He has since moved to Geffen Records, which owns his first two albums. He also won a Grammy for his album _When Disaster Strikes_. He had a major-league pop hit with 'Feel It (Ode To Sex)', featuring Mary J. Blige, from his album _The Gameplan_ (Universal). The follow-up, _The Imperial_ , became his best-selling album in the UK, while in the US the rapper collaborated with Mariah Carey on 'Bye Bye Bye', a</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:12
