Harmony is the third studio album by the American contemporary Christian music band MercyMe. It was released on November 25, 2010. The album was released in the United States by Inpop Records, and in the United Kingdom by Word Entertainment. The album is the last MercyMe album to be released on Inpop. It was produced by Brown Bannister. The album's singles were "Overcome", "The Memory Remains", "Sing It Anyway", and "Homesick".

Critical reception

Harmony garnered critical acclaim from the eight music critics that reviewed the album. Timothy Estabrooks, lead pastor of Covenant Life Church in Lubbock, Texas, said in his review for AllMusic, "MercyMe have continued to show their commitment to this kind of accessible, radio-friendly, and uplifting music. They certainly don't deviate from their tried-and-true formulas on Harmony, and their consistency makes them a band that I can always put on when I want a taste of praise-and-worship without venturing too far into the land of the sacred, sacred cow." At Christian Broadcasting Network, Andrea K. Buffkin said, "MercyMe has hit a new high."

CCM Magazines Andy Argyrakis concluded in his review that the album was a "satisfying listen". Argyrakis called the album, "one of the groups strongest efforts to date." At Indie Vision Music, Jonathan Andre noted that the album, "shows us why MercyMe has been so successful over the years, and why they will continue to be so for a long time to come. Harmony is classic MercyMe.  A must for all of your MercyMe needs."

At New Release Tuesday, Kevin Davis highlighted the fact that the album's lyrics are positive, "and when MercyMe sings about God, itâ€™s rarely about judgment but always about love. 'You are the one / You are the one / Who I will follow,' the band proclaims." Kim Jones of About.com proclaimed that "this album feels like a compilation of previous albums and nothing new has been added. The only thing of interest is the song "Sing It Anyway" which sounds like something off the Welcome to the New album." However, the reviewer went on to highlight the rest of the album, and stated that although it did not have any "bizarre and eclectic sounds", it was not a bad album.

Commercial performance
The album debuted at No. 17 on Billboard 200. It also debuted at No. 1 on Billboard'''s Christian Albums chart, becoming MercyMe's fourth consecutive No. 1 release. In addition, the album debuted at No. 5 on Billboard's Rock Chart, No. 9 on the Digital Albums Chart and No. 7 on the Christian Digital Albums Chart. This was the band's first album since 2009's Welcome to the New to not have any sales in the United Kingdom. It reached No. 12 in Switzerland and No. 35 in Finland.
