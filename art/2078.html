Rogue’s Lair is designed to be more than a straight follow up to the main game, but also acts as a nice reward for those players looking for a new challenge or starting their villain career from the beginning. We made a lot of improvements to the Rogue’s Lair game as well as some changes to what players will be seeing in their Rogue’s Lair games and we hope you like it! Here’s a look at some of the updates and additions.

New Rogue’s Lair Gameplay:

New game over screen: Rogue’s Lair is designed so that in the event of defeat, you don’t automatically lose, but instead need to make a tough choice. Either stay on the roof of your building (and have to do the sequence all over again, with more powerful enemies) or escape!

New escape feature: A new feature allows you to escape after defeat in one of your Rogue’s Lair games. There’s more danger however as a new enemy has been added and, if you make it, can either join the main game or continue to be a sidekick villain.

New level cap: We have a few new abilities to add to the game in the form of new skills and have increased the character skill cap to 99.

New sidekick and villain ability choices: While we do have some new sidekick abilities for this version of the game, we have a brand new villain skill tree that has been introduced and will continue to be updated as we bring new features to the game over time.

New Rogue’s Lair enemies: The enemies you’ll see in your Rogue’s Lair game will be significantly tougher than anything you saw in the main game. They’re no easy pickings and will require you to consider your strategy and make smart use of your abilities to be victorious.

New villains perks: We’ve introduced a new perk system that will allow you to give yourself and your sidekicks some abilities based on play styles and personal preferences.

New customization: Customization is back in a big way and you can now select your own character’s clothing, hair and face to a certain degree. You can even change how your face looks. The options are great and we can’t wait to see what you’ll do with them!

New gear sets: More gear has been added and you’ll have to explore the city even more to find it.

New enemy types: Along with new gear sets, you’ll also see new types of enemies pop up around the city that may give you trouble

New Rogue’s Lair Environments:

New environments: We’ve expanded the Rogue’s Lair game to include more diverse locations including areas you’ve seen in the main game and new environments to give you a bigger environment to roam around. You’ll also be able to explore on your own in a 2 player versus section of the game.

New character models: We’ve made some tweaks and changes to the character models you’ll see on screen, and while some of these might be subtle, we hope you love them.

New Villain Locations: A new map layout has been added that has 4 new villain sections to explore. There will be other locations too, but we’re not yet at a point to show off those.

New Rogue’s Lair gameplay:

Story Mode: A new story mode is a separate game where you’re introduced to new villains, your sidekicks and have a chance to get to know them as you see them get defeated in an event you can influence.

New difficulty level: This is the first time you’ll be able to get close to defeating your friends as you play through as an old sidekick in a Rogue’s Lair event. You can even choose if they join you, or if they stay as a sidekick.

New challenges: We added a new system where you will unlock challenges and will have the ability to complete them to unlock new game modes.

New skills: Not to brag, but we’ve added some more challenging abilities that were originally planned for the main game but didn’t quite make the cut. You’ll be able to see for yourself what they do when you get your hands on Rogue’s Lair.

New Gear:

New gear: We’ve added some new gear that will give you an advantage when entering the different Rogue’s Lair events

Level cap: A new level cap has been added in Rogue’s Lair where you will be able to level up your gear by acquiring new weapons, skills, powers and abilities.

New sidekick abilities: We’ve added some new abilities and upgrades to your sidekicks that can help you along the way!

Enemy Gear: We’ve also added some new enemy equipment and power ups. There’s more you’ll have to get your hands on, but we don’t want to spoil anything!

New Rogue’s Lair Environments:

New environments: The Rogue’s Lair game has a new set of environments that we’ve been wanting to show for a while and now’s the time.

New character models: While this is really more of a rework than an overhaul, we’ve changed up some character models that you’ll see on screen. You’ll also see some new ones too.

New Villain Locations: There’s 4 new villain locations to visit, we can’t wait to show you them.

New Rogue’s Lair Multiplayer:

Rogue’s Lair Multiplayer. In addition to the new Single player Rogue’s Lair game you can also play through multiplayer events with other players. If you want to play with others in multiplayer, just pick up the new Rogue’s Lair Multiplayer pack today on Steam!

The Rogue’s Lair Multiplayer pack includes a brand new 4 player single-screen Rogue’s Lair multiplayer map designed with larger-scale multiplayer action in mind, a new Rogue’s Lair multiplayer mode and all future updates.

As much as I’m really excited for this new Rogue’s Lair game, I have to confess I was one of the people that was left feeling confused about the first game. I’d love to play it again, and to my delight it appears we can. Rogue’s Lair is the online single-player mode that will also appear in a new DLC expansion pack: Rogue’s Lair: The Arena. Although Rogue’s Lair: The Arena won’t have any single-player component, it will act as a new DLC pack in the Rogue’s Lair online mode.

Now for those who didn’t get the first game, Rogue’s Lair lets you choose to play through story mode as the main character: the Riddler. His goal is to defeat Batman, and to do so he enlists the aid of several powerful henchmen like Killer Croc and Bane. Players control the main character and control a massive collection of henchmen whose personalities are dictated by a new system that dynamically adjusts the personalities of the henchmen based on their performance in battle. Players are able to change up their strategy at any time in order to defeat Batman</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:56
