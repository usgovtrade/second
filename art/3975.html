"Good and Guilty" was written by Dottie Wayne and Cathy Majors and originally recorded by The Statler Brothers in 1969. It was included in the album The Statler Brothers Sing Country, which was released in 1970.

Majors said in an interview with Country Music: The Rough Guide, that this was "one of the worst songs that ever got a Top 10 hit", but said it was included in the album for the fun of it: "We thought if people can't sing it, at least we'll know it's a hit when the audience starts screaming for us."

The track was covered in 2008 by country music artist, Dierks Bentley on his album Riser.
