A new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation found Americans are more likely to have coverage through their employers (67 percent) or by buying it on their own (18 percent) than through the ACA. Additionally, about half of Americans (47 percent) didn't know about the ACA, or said they were unsure of how it works.

“Given the current debate over what will replace the ACA in the near term, this is probably not a good thing for Republicans and for the White House, who want people to know more about it, and hopefully to like it, rather than have a negative view about it," Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said during a press call.

Altman noted that there is “still time for this to change,” pointing to Democrats and liberal interest groups.

“The ACA was the biggest public policy change in this country in decades, so we’re a little further into it than we would have been with previous public policy changes, and I would expect the public’s familiarity with the ACA and what it does and does not do to continue to rise,” he added.

The findings are a stark contrast to those of earlier polls. In June 2016, an ABC News/Washington Post poll found Americans were nearly twice as likely to say their health care coverage was through the ACA (38 percent) rather than employer (19 percent).

Additionally, 60 percent of respondents had a positive view of the ACA, compared to the 26 percent who had a negative view.

The new survey, conducted June 18-22, 2017, comes amid debate over the future of the ACA, with the White House beginning to roll out alternative plans on the Obamacare marketplaces, including one that would allow states to opt out of the law's coverage requirements.

Last week, the Trump administration released an outline for a bill that would repeal and replace the ACA. According to a draft of the bill, Americans will be allowed to buy policies across state lines, with each state given the option of opting in or out.

If it's passed, Trump would have the ability to grant waivers to states to loosen regulations on insurers, including requirements around pre-existing conditions and minimum benefits.

"Now that we have a window into what Republican voters really want and what they are hearing, it's clear that we are not in for a quick repeal or even a smooth transition to a new program,” Altman said.

The poll also found that Americans are more likely to have a positive view of the ACA (36 percent) than of the Republicans (31 percent).

While more Republicans than Democrats have a negative view of the ACA, Trump's favorable rating is higher among Democrats than Republicans, in contrast with the findings of the recent ABC News/Washington Post poll.

This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone June 18-22, 2017, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.3 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 33 percent Republican, 32 percent Democratic, 31 percent independent and 4 percent other.

Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the number of people responding to the survey. The poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone June 18-22, 2017, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults. The error was in the pollster's description of the response rate. It was 67 percent, not 67 percent of people who said they know their healthcare options or have received ACA coverage.
