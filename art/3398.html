Click to select one or more options for CAPTCHA Forms.

Click Apply to confirm your changes.

The setting can be found in the Form Designer area of this screen. To get here, click the Form button in the Home section of the menu bar. To get there, type “form” in the search box of the Home section of the menu bar.

Create Forms with CAPTCHA

If you choose not to turn off CAPTCHA on a form, but you choose to customize the settings, you will need to enable CAPTCHA on each individual form. You can do this in the form settings in the Form Designer, as described above.

You can choose to use either the built-in CAPTCHA or one you created by using one of the many CAPTCHA add-ons available. To find the CAPTCHA add-on that best fits your needs, enter “captcha” in the search box of the Add-ons section of the Form Builder menu. You can then sort the results by most recommended, or you can browse through each of the results by clicking on the blue Download button on the add-on you choose.

If you choose to use a CAPTCHA add-on, it will appear on the form that you are creating. You will be able to choose its settings as part of the Form Designer. If you want to change the CAPTCHA settings for a form already created, click on the form itself to open the Form Designer.

Additional notes

If you are creating a new form for a site on which the CAPTCHA feature is already active, consider placing the CAPTCHA form before the existing CAPTCHA form on the site. This way, when a visitor tries to access a form requiring CAPTCHA, they will see the CAPTCHA form that was active when the form was built.

If you are using the CAPTCHA feature on a form with more than one page, check that the CAPTCHA form is located on each and every page that includes any of your form's form fields. If you place the CAPTCHA form on any page other than the first page, you will see a warning when you try to save your form and click the Continue button.

Check the CAPTCHA setting for the Form Builder on which you are working. For example, if you created a CAPTCHA form on a site that has another CAPTCHA form set to use your default settings, the next user that tries to access the site will see an image of a CAPTCHA.

If you have created a CAPTCHA form for a site that is running a test instance of the Form Builder, you will receive a CAPTCHA warning each time you try to access the form from the Form Builder.

If you have created a CAPTCHA form with multiple pages, consider placing the CAPTCHA image on the first page of the form. If you need to insert a CAPTCHA image after the page break in a multi-page form, you can do so by simply inserting a space, and then adding the CAPTCHA image to the remaining empty space.

For example: If you have a form with three pages and you decide to insert a space at the beginning of the third page, you would insert a “ " (that is, a space and a blank line). When the user reaches the third page, a CAPTCHA image will appear, before the page break and then a blank line is inserted.

For information on CAPTCHA as an add-on, see the CAPTCHA add-ons section.

Note: If you select and add CAPTCHA to a form that uses a CAPTCHA add-on, a field will appear in the Add-ons section of the Form Designer that shows the name of the CAPTCHA add-on that was used.
