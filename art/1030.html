Of course, PlugShare is more limited than the range of the Tesla Superchargers. The Superchargers charge at up to 250 miles of range in 30 minutes, or 5-10 miles per minute.

A number of developers have set up charging stations using the PlugShare standard and the latest example is at the Google campus in Mountain View, CA. Developed by a company called Volta (in collaboration with Google and the city of Mountain View), the parking lot at the Googleplex is now one of the largest public charging stations in the world.

PlugShare has only been around for about three years and the majority of charging stations are public charging stations. This service is not only convenient for electric car drivers, it also helps encourage electric car sales. The charging is free and the stations have open access for anyone to use. It helps to encourage drivers to use electric cars and it promotes awareness for a more energy efficient transportation future.

With the help of Google, Volta has installed 1,000 charging stations in the United States and in China. The charging stations were installed at the Googleplex campus and many other public places like hotels, airports, office buildings, train stations, parking garages, and government buildings.

Volta's PlugShare service can be used by individuals, corporations, educational institutions, non-profits and public institutions for the public charging network. The stations can be accessed using a free app for Android and iOS devices, and allows customers to get detailed charging information and manage their plans. The service is expanding to public charging stations in other locations around the United States, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa.

"We designed the Volta platform to scale, as to create the lowest cost, highest density, and the fastest network for rapid charging," said Chris Giorgio, CEO of Volta. "Volta's unique business model gives electric vehicle drivers the option to either be an electric vehicle driver or a charging customer."

Volta has also developed a network of charging stations that provide discounted charging rates for consumers who are a member of the Volta network. Volta currently has approximately 60 charging locations in the Bay Area and Northern California.

Although the PlugShare charging stations aren't necessarily free for users, they do provide customers with discounted rates when they charge their car. For example, a charging session costs $5.29 to $7.39 in San Francisco, depending on the station. This will save you $35 if you charge a fully-charged Model S for $14.25/hour for an hour, and then it costs only $9.50 to top off your car.

Also, it's possible to buy charging stations for your own home or business. An outlet that is $3,000 or less can be purchased for $2,500, and a home outlet can be installed for $1,500. In total, a charging station purchase can cost less than $5,000. That's a savings of over $10,000 over the regular cost of a Tesla Supercharger.

With the Volta charging stations at the Googleplex, there are no restrictions for charging for people who have purchased the charging stations. However, there is a price structure, which can be seen on the website. This allows public users the ability to charge for free and members will pay a reduced rate for charging if they are members.

For those who like to plug their electric car in at home, a Level 2 home outlet charging station is available for $350, a Level 3 home outlet charging station is available for $550 and a Level 4 home outlet charging station is available for $750. The $1,000 level 1 home outlet charging station is also available for $1,000.

There are two pricing models for electric vehicle charging stations:

Volta - Volta members pay only $4.99/hour to charge at a charging station that has been installed for them, with the total charges being only $7.99 per hour, but the car will be charged back to 100 percent. For non-members, the hourly rate is $8.99 and the charge to the car will be $12.99, but the charge is only $10.99.

Volta Plus - Charging stations installed by independent installers will be available for $2.99 for Volta Plus members and $4.99 for non-members. The Volta Plus level 2 charging station will charge a car from 0-80 percent in 30 minutes, and will charge a car from 0-100 percent in an hour. The Volta Plus level 3 charging station will charge a car from 0-95 percent in 30 minutes, and will charge a car from 0-120 percent in an hour. The Volta Plus level 4 charging station will charge a car from 0-90 percent in 30 minutes, and will charge a car from 0-120 percent in an hour.

How will I be charged with Volta?

The Volta charging network will charge drivers when they approach a charging station and they are allowed to use the charging station. It will only charge when the drivers have a valid credit card on file. This will help reduce the chances of fraudulent charges by charging stations or third parties.

"At this point, the goal is to have charging stations installed at every gas station," said Chris Giorgio, CEO of Volta.

Tesla is still experimenting with wireless charging, as its technology is proprietary. Currently, Tesla is preparing to introduce its Supercharger-like technology with Model 3 vehicles. Tesla already introduced the idea of home charging stations with its Supercharger network, but Tesla doesn't like the term "tethered" and considers the network to be wireless. With Tesla's home charging stations, Supercharger-like technology, the Tesla Model S does not have to be hooked up to a charger to charge. The model will still charge using the cord like today's Superchargers. With Tesla's Supercharging technology, there is an opportunity to offer a cheaper charging option for people who don't need to travel long distances. The Model S can charge at 150 kW, but with the Supercharger network, it can charge at 150 kW and 300 kW. This is an exciting new addition, but it's only applicable to a car that has a "Tesla" on the license plate.

Electric car charging standards like Level 2 charging stations will allow for a more inexpensive charging network. Although they don't charge at super high speeds like Tesla Superchargers do, it's an easier way to spread the adoption of electric cars.

The PlugShare charging stations will help people gain greater awareness for the charging infrastructure and help spur the electric car market. This is a win-win situation, as charging stations help the environment and are a useful tool for those looking to adopt electric cars.
