"What are you waiting for?" "Finish him!" "Just try not to get too many of those cockroaches on you, all right?" "Shelby, what's taking you so long?" "You have to keep moving." "If he sees you, he'll kill you both." "Hey, buddy!" "Wake up." "Hey, come on!" "Guys!" "Guys!" "Please, stop this!" "This isn't funny anymore." "You're scaring me!" "My cousin didn't freak out when they showed her the movie Saw." "Get that off my face!" "What?" "Guys, if you're going to kill me, just kill me." "Why are you making me look crazy?" "How is that not crazy?" "Stop it!" "Shelby, they're all around us." "You and I aren't going anywhere." "Don't let him take me!" "Stop it!" "Okay, enough!" "You're going to kill him." "You're not a normal person." "You can't just spaz out every time someone threatens your life." "All right, look, if I've learned anything from talking to you, it's that being a normal person is overrated, all right?" "The world is a scary place, you have to fight back!" "You have to take action." "If you sit there and do nothing, you'll die." "I'm not doing nothing!" "I'm watching this." "Hey, look, we'll deal with that." "There he is." "There's a guy." "Oh, God!" "That looks like our boss." "Justin, do something!" "He's got a gun!" "I'm looking." "I'm looking." "Oh, no!" "That's not our boss!" "Oh, shit!" "Help!" "Hey!" "Look, hey!" "He's not our boss!" "He just borrowed our boss's car!" "Whoa!" "Whoa!" "Hey!" "Look, I'm calling the cops right now." "Please don't hurt me." "You have to believe me!" "This isn't funny anymore." "It's really not." "It's not funny." "There's one right behind you!" "I see it, I see it." "Turn around." "What?" "No!" "Oh, my God." "Hey!" "Turn around, he's right behind you!" "No!" "Oh, my God!" "Oh, my God!" "Oh, my God!" "Hello?" "This is 911 Emergency Response, how may I help you?" "Hello, yes." "I'm a student at Harvard University." "My class schedule says that I should be getting a call from the Final Club right now, but I haven't received any call at all." "So can you please have them call me back?" "I'm on the North Bridge, and I'm walking home and I've been stabbed several times in the stomach and chest and I just really want to get home!" "I'm on Route 30, just west of Palmer Street." "Thank you." "Hello?" "911." "No!" "I'm a student at Harvard." "Yeah, but it's not funny." "This guy wants to kill us!" "I'm so scared!" "Can you hurry?" "The guy with the gun is back!" "Hello?" "Hey!" "Where the hell are you?" "No!" "We're near Memorial Hall!" "We're on University Road!" "Yeah, I got that." "I got that." "Okay, I'm coming." "You have to hurry!" "He's trying to kill us!" "No!" "We're students at Harvard!" "Okay." "How the hell did you find me?" "We traced your cell." "No, it's a tracking device!" "We have you located!" "Hey!" "Hey, it's him!" "We're on University Road!" "Where the hell are you?" "Yeah, we're near the science building." "Okay, I see you." "Hey!" "Stop!" "I'm gonna smash this!" "Oh, my God." "Hey!" "Hey!" "What do we do?" "We need to get to a hospital." "We can't go to the hospital." "He'll find us." "We need to get out of here." "Okay, you need a gun." "I have a gun." "You have a gun?" "She has a gun." "Do you even know how to use that?" "Yeah, I was in the army." "I've used one before." "We can't go to the hospital and you don't have a plan." "Well, you know, it was a pretty stupid plan to begin with, but, yeah, no, we definitely can't go to the hospital." "Where's the car?" "Yeah." "Come on!" "Okay." "Come on!" "Where are you going?" "To your car." "I'm gonna go get it, and then we're gonna take you to the hospital." "Okay, and then when you get to the hospital, you gonna tell them that you have a family emergency, okay?" "And then they're gonna put me in jail." "No, they're not." "Because I have a gun." "No!" "No!" "Okay!" "All right!" "Wait, wait, wait!" "We are not going to the car together!" "No, we have to." "Okay?" "He knows I have a gun." "He will chase you down." "He will chase you down and he will shoot you!" "It's all right." "Go!" "No, I'm going with you!" "No, you're not." "Trust me." "Please." "Go, go, go!" "Now I'm gonna take off my clothes, okay?" "You're gonna take off your clothes?" "Yeah, you better." "I'm gonna go in that dressing room right now." "Put your clothes on." "No!" "It's unlocked!" "No, it's not." "I'm not wearing any clothes!" "You need to put some clothes on right now!" "Okay, I'll go in the dressing room and put on some clothes!" "No!" "What do you mean no?" "No." "You better get dressed or else..." "Why are you doing this?" "Stop being a dick!" "Take your clothes off!" "You better get dressed or else I'll get really naked right in front of you!" "Dude, take your clothes off!" "Oh, my God." "Hello!" "Hey, I'm sorry about that, man." "I was gonna be a gentleman and let you eat her out, but she's not that attractive." "You look like my grandfather." "So I brought you some clothes." "Thank you." "Good idea." "Well, your car's not there." "Yeah, yeah." "That's because I have a car." "Yeah." "That is why." "All right, guys, let's go over this one more time." "So you saw two guys with guns in the back of the car, correct?" "Right." "And then what happened?" "I heard a gunshot, and then I heard someone say that you should drive because something was wrong with the brakes." "And then they pushed me down and said that I should just stay down." "I really can't say too much more." "You don't need to say anything, actually." "Okay, good, good." "So, just as a formality," "I'm going to confirm your name, okay?" "Yeah." "Yeah." "Your name is..." "It's Justin, yeah." "Justin." "Yeah, I'm sorry." "I know you know who I am." "Okay." "That's enough of that." "That's a problem, actually." "That's enough of that." "Yeah, guys, that's enough of that." "Okay, that's plenty of that." "Okay?" "It's enough of that." "No, I'm not sure that we actually need to go over-- okay, then" "Yeah, the problem is this." "I think you did really good out there today, and you did everything that you could possibly do." "And then some!" "Now, you just need to start asking yourself, what did you do wrong?" "Saved your life, bro." "That's what you did." "Thank you." "I appreciate it." "It's more than I did." "So now we can fix this." "Yeah, there's something I'd like you to do for me." "Yeah, that's good." "Listen to me, and I'm not trying to scare you, but this is how it's got to go down." "Okay." "As soon as I leave this office," "I'm gonna have two SWAT teams that are gonna be at your location in less than three minutes." "You're gonna be surrounded, your family's gonna be surrounded." "Okay." "You're gonna be dead if you don't do exactly what I say." "Exactly what you say?" "Exactly what you say." "I need you to run to that white Suburban out there and you open the back door and you get in that truck and you stay in that truck for a half hour and you don't make a sound."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:32
