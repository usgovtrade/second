The park was opened in 1934 and dedicated to William Edwards, a civic leader and businessman instrumental in creating the park. The name of the park, City Park, is shared by many local parishes and communities.

The Annual Flower Show features a wide range of floral arrangements, and provides numerous educational experiences to children and adults alike. In 2013, 80 exhibitors participated in the show and the Spring Flower Show was open from March 22 until April 4.

The Flower Show in New Orleans began on Mardi Gras Day in 1949, when more than 250 floral designers brought out their talents to the community. This year's event was once again held at the City Park.
