It is the first of two "dungeon" levels in the story mode, and the second that has the appearance of a castle.

An army of Nasty Rats attacks the castle from the lake on the shores of it. Luigi must try to beat them up without getting too close to the lake. In some levels, he must find specific objects and use them in his quest to defeat the army.

Gameplay [ edit ]

Dungeon [ edit ]

Dungeon map showing different areas of the dungeon.

The level is split in three parts: a main, a side and a boss room.

At the very beginning of the level, Mario and Luigi land on the ground as an island in a lake. There are two platforms here. They must climb up onto it, without drowning in water.

When the two go onto the first platform, it rises in the air and spins, transporting them to another area of the room. In this area, there is a castle and a small lake. When Mario and Luigi reach the surface of this lake, they see that it is infested by an army of angry rats, who are currently fighting with each other.

Luigi needs to find three keys to open the gates, which lead to the dungeon and the castle.

In the front of the level is a big pillar that turns when touched and a pool on the sides.

Wandering around the dungeon, Mario and Luigi will find a lot of chests full of objects that Luigi can use. These objects are:

Plunger (P1 and P2) : It will shoot Luigi higher into the air.

Planting Flower (P1 and P2) : Plant this on the ground to create a flower fountain.

Flame Thrower (P1 and P2) : This will throw Luigi higher in the air and with greater speed.

Flame Boomerang (P1 and P2) : This boomerang will send fire bombs that burn everything.

Bull's Eye (P1 and P2) : This is a bomb, but it is very weak.

Chiseled stone (P1 and P2) : This is a very strong wall that will prevent Luigi from falling.

Fire Bomb (P1 and P2) : This bomb explodes in the air and damages anything around.

Cannonball (P1 and P2) : This makes it easier to defeat the enemies with the cannonballs.

In the side room, there is a big hole that Luigi can fall through to reach the bottom. The hole can be used to navigate to other places in the level.

As Mario and Luigi travel around the dungeon, they will also come across an armrest in the middle of the room that if you can use it, it will make it easier to defeat the enemies.

When the duo reach the bottom, they will find three chests full of a big amount of coins:

Chest I: Luigi gets 5 coins.

Chest II: Mario gets 5 coins.

Chest III: All the coins in the three chests.

After being defeated, the rats retreat to the castle. It seems they are going to sleep, until Mario and Luigi arrive and try to get to the top of the castle.

Boss [ edit ]

Once they climb up the top of the castle, they find a huge gate that must be broken down. To do this, they must search for a secret door in the inside of the castle walls. At the top, they find a stone bridge with a hole in it. To reach the next area, they must cross the bridge. Luigi must carefully navigate it to avoid falling into the water below, which will result in a Game Over.

At the next area, there is a red key box here, and they must insert the key to unlock the doors of the castle.

After this, they need to go down a staircase that leads to a room with a fountain. The fountain starts to spew deadly water that will kill anything that is around it. Mario and Luigi must go up the staircase to avoid being affected by the water.

Once they go up a second staircase, they have to navigate a small maze-like area full of small gaps in the wall and spikes on the ground. Mario must climb up to reach the next floor, where there is another secret key.

After this, they need to enter the very small castle. They must jump on the small platforms that lead to the next area. If Mario or Luigi fall on the water below, they will get hurt, but they will not get killed. There is a key under the water, so Mario and Luigi must find it.

After reaching the next room, Mario and Luigi must climb up a ladder and go down the room to find a key. This key is hidden at the bottom of a small well. After finding this key, they must go down some steps and use the key to unlock the next door.

At the next room, they need to wait for one of the three gears to stop spinning. Once this happens, Mario will use a cannonball to destroy it. He then falls in a room that will end the level.

After the room, they are attacked by a flying enemy. Luigi must take care of the flying enemies with his flamethrower. Then, they must jump out of the castle through the gap in the ceiling.

After this, they need to find the last key, which is inside the statue.

The final area of the level is a set of pillars with a red carpet under them. On the pillars are the keys needed to open the doors. After Mario and Luigi have found these keys, they need to wait for the three pillars to stop spinning. Then, they need to climb the platforms to go down the stairs and leave the level.

Level walkthrough [ edit ]

Mario and Luigi enter the room after jumping from a ramp of stairs. A platform spins up and they get thrown in the air. When they land, they find that the spinning platform has taken them to a new area, a lake on the side of a castle. They must find the keys needed to open the castle gate here.

One of the keys that is needed can be found by clicking on a pipe in the lower left. The door to the castle can be found by clicking on a large blue pipe that's in the lower right. Once inside the castle, they find four pillars and a red carpet in the middle.

Mario and Luigi now need to climb the four pillars to reach the next area, a castle courtyard. After climbing the pillars, Mario opens the gate in front of them. Then, Mario jumps to a cannonball and destroys the statue that is next to it. He then falls into the room and is taken to another room, with three enemies, a chiseled stone and the last key. After fighting the enemies and collecting the final key, Mario uses the cannonball again to destroy another statue and get to the next room.

When Mario jumps off the cannonball in this room, he sees that there are four switches inside. They need to operate these switches to release the cannonballs that are preventing them from leaving the area. Once the switches are activated, a cannonball hits one of them. To break these switches, Mario and Luigi have to use cannonballs. When they are activated, they will take them to the final room, where Mario and Luigi can go down a ladder to leave the level.

Tips [ edit ]

Certain enemies can be taken down very quickly by pressing the jump button rapidly.

The cannons' projectiles can be absorbed by destroying a wall of fire or ice. This also causes the cannon to be destroyed as well.

Mario and Luigi can throw their items to hit enemies and deal damage to them. This makes it easier to defeat the weakest enemies.

This level can be used to collect the items needed for the Dungeon level.

Jumping in place does more damage to the Boo. It does 100 damage each time. This is the fastest way to defeat them.

The flying enemies are dangerous, so avoid them. Also, the flying enemies can kill Mario if they fall on him.

Enemies that are on a small island can be easily killed by shooting out a cannonball and using it as a projectile to kill the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:43
