No sign of danger was all that could be seen in this part of the forest. Trees of every type and size could be seen with small, almost hidden paths of footprints along the way that Quiggly followed.

Once in a while he could see the tops of the trees. There was no other sign of life, not a sound, not a hint of danger, not even birds, nothing but his own footsteps that grew fainter with every step, which led him forward for the better part of the day.

Finally, he saw the familiar shape of a cabin appear out of the darkness ahead of him. This was the place he had been looking for. He ran at full speed to where the cabin stood and dashed up the steps.

As he entered the cabin, Quiggly felt tired and cold. He was exhausted and soaked from the long and strenuous run through the forest. All he could do was go to the bed, which he did.

The next morning, Quiggly awoke and he felt better than the day before. His body ached and there were pains in his legs and shoulders. His arms felt as if they had been pulled down with weights. But he felt better than he had in months, and decided that the journey he had been on for the past few days had been to his benefit.

Getting out of bed, Quiggly stretched to his limit and then relaxed in his recliner, trying to get used to being in his home again after many months of living in a cave. Quiggly was very excited to be back. It had been a good experience. He looked at his surroundings and saw the walls. They had not been renovated in a while, which he found refreshing. There were holes in the ceiling and walls, and there was a door that was not functioning. He was happy to see the door was made of the same material as the walls and ceiling.

Quiggly then looked at the ceiling. He noticed that there was a strange shape above him that resembled a bird or a bat. It had a round shape with a large chest, a head on the neck, and two eyes.

The man looked over the room and it looked like it had been done at some point in time. Quiggly walked through the door to the bathroom, which was attached to his bedroom. The toilet had a lid that looked like a lid on a coffin. The toilet had a small hole and he decided to take a whiz.

After he finished, Quiggly walked back into the bedroom and he suddenly noticed his feet were facing the front of the house, which was strange. He looked at the ceiling again and saw the bat looking back at him. It had wings that looked like the wings of a bat. The shape was a lot like the shape of the door, only it was upside down and the mouth, which was at the top, was facing his head.

He took another look at the object. His heart was pounding in his chest and he was so frightened that he became frightened of his own thoughts. He took a deep breath and continued to take in the details of the bat-like creature.

The bat was staring at him again. It was staring right into his eyes with two large dark eyes that were looking back at him.

Quiggly felt an instant, overwhelming fear in his body that gave him a feeling like he was about to lose his mind. His hands became ice cold as if they were being held in icy water that numbed every fiber of his body. Quiggly felt he was going to die. He was terrified, thinking that the bat wanted to kill him. Quiggly's eyes saw the fear in the eyes of the bat. This had never happened to him before.

As soon as the bat turned its attention away from him, Quiggly's fear subsided. He felt the fear and relief simultaneously and was filled with emotions.

He felt as if he had just been handed the key to death, no matter how hard or fast you can die. It did not matter what your body was used to or if you were born as an angel or a devil. Nothing can keep your body from dying. Death could come at any time, any place, and it did not care about color or race, or whether you were a child or adult.

Death could come unexpectedly and suddenly and would not give you time to say good-bye or to tell others of your feelings about dying. And Quiggly suddenly realized that his belief that death was evil was wrong. Death had no power over us. We are the ones that have power over death.

Quiggly shook his head in disbelief. He had not been wrong about death being evil all those times. He had always seen death as something evil and something he did not want to touch. Now, the bat told him that death was good.

Quiggly then laughed at himself for such childish thoughts. Death had a hold of him for the rest of his life.

Quiggly tried to get his head straight and then went to the door of the bedroom and found it was locked. The knob would turn to the left side only, but not the right side. He tried it again and again with no luck. His fingers were sore, but he used them anyway to turn the knob to the left. The door opened only halfway, and Quiggly began thinking of ways he might open the door.

At that moment the door opened all the way and Quiggly was startled. He knew that he should have expected it and not given in to his fear.

Quiggly turned around and tried the door the same way he had been trying to turn it. The door still moved but not as far as before. As he walked into the room, he looked into the bat-shaped object and then saw a small hole in the wall and realized that he had used this method to open the door earlier. He closed the door and turned on the light. He was shocked to see there was no place in the room where he could close the door.

As he turned around, he saw that the bed, was hanging in the air. He shook his head in disbelief and the bed, the nightstand, and the clothes on the floor rose about three feet into the air.

He stepped to the side of the bed and grabbed the sides of the top of the bed in an attempt to hold it in place. The bed was the only thing supporting it as it slowly rotated with him standing underneath it. Quiggly's arms were tired from trying to hold onto the bed, and he was exhausted and breathing heavily. He realized that he could not hold on to the bed and that he needed to hold on to the side of the bed. So he reached up and grabbed the side of the bed to keep from falling. At the same time, his body went over the side of the bed as it continued to rotate.

Quiggly stood up, facing the bat-shape hanging in the room, and asked him, "What is it you want?" Quiggly held onto the side of the bed with his arms for a moment and was able to get his feet onto the side of the bed. He stood on the bed and saw that the bed was beginning to rise into the air as well. The bed was moving so fast that it was rising three feet in the air.

Quiggly was frightened at what was happening. He was not afraid of dying, because he had been there before and it did not bother him. He was afraid of what was happening to his body and was terrified to be suspended three feet in the air as the bed was moving into the walls of the room. He tried to make sense of what was happening to him.

He decided to get out of the room. He stepped backwards and reached behind him to take a hold of the bat-shape hanging in the room. He was unsuccessful, and it became more real to him that something strange was happening. He could not hold onto anything. He was falling down from the bed as the bed continued to fall into the walls of the room.

As he stepped backwards towards the doorway, the door opened, and Quiggly saw his hand disappear through the hole in the top of the doorway and then saw a hole in the floor below his hand. He decided to take his chances and jump through the hole. He continued to stand and saw the bed rise to the level it had been at when he was in the room. Quiggly walked over and grabbed the footboard, which was the only thing left in the room, and pulled it with him as he jumped through the hole. He landed in the hole with the bed, and the door closed again.

Quiggly then looked at the bed as it began to move into the walls of the room. The wall that it had risen against was being destroyed and slowly fell as the bed was moving.

He jumped out of the hole and went into the woods, running towards the woodshed.

When Quiggly arrived at the wood shed, he saw it was not a wooden shed at all but was the same material as the walls of the room. As he walked around, he noticed the back side of the wood shed was a door that was being created by wood being pressed into the side of the wall. It was like the door of a house made of wood with hinges at the bottom, but with only two knobs on the door.

Quiggly wondered why he was even able to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:23
