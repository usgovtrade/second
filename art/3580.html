The introduction of Act Gambling is believed to have been due to a combination of popular demand and political changes in the nation.

Act Gambling

The Act Gambling was introduced on 17 April 2005 in an attempt to tighten the laws regarding gambling, particularly the issue of 'Sports betting' (sports gambling) and how casinos, lotteries and bingo halls can obtain a license.  Under the provisions of the act, in South Africa there is a requirement for all operators to obtain licences, except for a list of restricted activities.  Each licence is issued for a specific entity.  These entities are to follow the rules and regulations of the Act Gambling.  Act Gambling prohibits unlicensed operators, who are said to be involved with gambling and/or any form of lottery.  However, under a certain section of the act, these entities are required to operate under the laws of the province or district that is in force, if they are not allowed by any of the Acts that are in force in their own provinces.

The Act Gambling did not legalize sports gambling, but rather extended legislation to regulate and control this practice in South Africa. As per the act, it is considered as a gambling activity if:

 any activity involves the making of a bet
 any person wins any sum of money for or on behalf of another
 any person receives anything of value which has been placed in a race, match or other form of competition.

The section on sports betting is to be interpreted in the following way:

 In terms of the Act Gambling, gambling will include both a wide variety of forms of betting and wagering, including both legal and illegal forms.

 In terms of the Act Gambling, all bets placed, and all other forms of wagers offered or taken, by the participants in all sports and other competitive games of skill will be included.

 In terms of the Act Gambling, the Act Gambling will apply to all games and sporting events except where the Gambling Act states to the contrary.

 In terms of the Act Gambling, all sporting events where individuals, syndicates or the public place bets or wagers on the outcome of an event will fall under the ambit of the Act Gambling and thus be subject to its provisions.

The regulations to deal with each gambling activity are to be laid out in the 'Gambling Regulations for Sports Gambling'.

The regulations were meant to be completed by 1 June 2005 and the regulations were ready for public feedback before or on that day. 
On 1 July 2005, the Act Gambling was published in the Government Gazette in terms of the Legislation Procedure Act.

Amendments to Act Gambling
The Act Gambling went through a number of changes, both in its wording and the procedures to obtaining a licence. 
On 30 October 2005, amendments to the Act Gambling Act were announced. 
As a result of the amendments, several changes were made to the Act Gambling.
The section on gambling in certain restricted activities were removed from the Act. 
It was stated that as per the legislation, gambling on these activities is illegal, and that they are only allowed in locations where they are legal, under provincial or municipal laws. 
Sports gambling was once again allowed in South Africa, but not on behalf of a government agency.
The Department of Sport (DOS) was responsible for issuing these licenses and licences are not being allowed to be granted to any entity where the DOS or the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) did not have oversight.
The amendments also allow for the use of a certain betting medium, so that those that gamble can also make wagers via this medium. 
The amendments make the rules for sports betting more specific, but this was done in an attempt to make these more similar to the Indian-based Gambling Bill that did not have any amendments.
