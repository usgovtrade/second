While some residents didn’t notice any difference, others told Bender that the service is much faster and more reliable than before.

“It has been fine. It is as it always has been,” said resident Michael Ehrig. “I think it has got a little better service than it has had in the past, maybe a little bit more dependable than it had in the past.”

As Bender reported, the $17.2 million project included a redesign of routes 11/41, 17/41, and 19/41 that resulted in some delays for pedestrians and cyclists, but is slated to be finished in February.

In the future, there is additional construction planned for the project.

The final stage of the project will require an overlay lane that could extend north to Kress Street in 2019 and require the complete reconstruction of route 11/41 from the bridge over the rail tracks to Maplewood Avenue.

As part of the reconstruction of routes 11/41 and 17/41, bike lanes will be removed.
