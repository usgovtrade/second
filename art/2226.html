I'd rather have them too. If you're done here, let's get going. It's been one day since I arrived here, yet I feel like I've lived half a lifetime. Just the same, I have a lot to do.

Shigure - Hey, Shigure. I was thinking about what to do today, and I want to go for a walk around the village. Let's go together. I want to get a feel of this town. What's there to do around here?

Yusuke - There's the lake over there, but I don't think you'll be interested in it, Shigure-san.

Shigure - That's true, but there's also this village inn... Say, Yusuke-kun, let's get in through the back way. We can sneak into the inn from that route. I'm sure we can find something interesting over there... There's the lake, and there's also the inn. It feels like something's waiting for us there, but it's not something I can tell you about now... Hey, I wonder if I'll be able to hear your yuri voices through the screen. You know what, let's get in via the back entrance, instead of the front entrance. You've already gotten your information, right? Let's play games together.

Ai - You really wanted to come to this town?

Yusuke - Of course I do. Since you're here, I won't be lonely. What's with this village? What kind of people live here?

Ai - You're so pushy... This is fun, isn't it? You've got big plans for that one over there...

Yusuke - Yeah. If I don't get caught red-handed, this'll be a gold mine. We can put the game on the side and put up a notice that's worth quite a bit, I think. It's better to do it here, though. I don't think that idiot will be a problem. But I'm glad we caught him red-handed. Now, let's go to the inn, Ai-chan... I feel like I can relax here for a while... We might get a bit of free time when they're busy cooking, so let's check out the game.

Ai - Come on, let's hurry up. Let's go, Yusuke.

(Lure)

(Rurichiyo)

(Hotaru)

We're done fishing, and we can't leave without a token of our good luck!

It's a token of good luck, too. What shall we do with it?

I don't really know if this is good luck or bad luck, but let's take it. It may bring you good fortune!

Let's take this as a sign of good fortune, and move forward to our next destination!

(Hotaru)

I don't know what to say about this. I don't know if I should listen to you, because I have a bad feeling about this.

Let's not talk about these things, please! Let's just leave this place!

(Yusuke)

No! Hotaru! No, you have no reason to be like that!

Let's calm down, and talk about it. Please? Let's see what happens?

Come on! After this, I'll always be able to support you! Please, Hotaru!

Please, let me hear your voice! Please come to this place!

(Hotaru)

You can see me?

(Yusuke)

Come on, come out... please! Come out and talk with me!

We can try communicating by way of speech, so let's give it a shot. I think we can work it out. Please!

(Hotaru)

Don't tell me... You've become a devil?

(Yusuke)

I've become the Devil, in other words.

I don't know why I was born the way I am, or what I should do... I'm just the way I am. I'm not really human, so I thought that if you were born as the Devil, we might be able to see each other's voices. When we did a voice search, we actually found each other. Since we have this, we can communicate. Right now, I'm in the same village as you. That's how our fate has worked out. For me, it's not that I'm happy. Just, I'm glad it worked out the way it is... That's why I'm saying this to you. This is probably a secret. I'm saying this so we can talk about it together.

I just need to hear your voice... Just listen to my voice... Please... Let's talk about this... Let's talk about the future, that is...

(Hotaru)

Let's fight together, Yusuke-san. There is no other way to go. There's no other way to go. We have to fight together.

I have the same kind of feelings as you do. You can't escape, so let's fight together.

(Yusuke)

I'm glad. You know what? Just listen to me, Hotaru. Let's save this town... We can do that! We're going to save this town! We're going to make people happy!

Please listen to me, Hotaru. I just want you to be happy... Please listen to me, Hotaru. Please... I'm glad I met you. I'm glad you're with me. I'm glad you came into my life... I think... I might be able to save this town. I'm looking forward to meeting you again... I can't really show my true feelings, but we're both going to fight together to save this town. I have faith in you, Hotaru... Because you're with me, I'm going to continue to fight, Hotaru...

So, I'm going to do it. I'm going to go to the town where we met. Please watch over me, Hotaru. I'm going to... I'm going to keep this town safe, so that people won't be sad anymore. Because I want people to live happily, too. We're fighting together.

I'm not really a human, so I'm not going to get myself killed. We're fighting together. I'm fighting together...

(Yusuke)

Hotaru... I'm really glad we met each other!

Ai - This way's no good. This place's not safe.

Yusuke - Wait a moment.

(Lure)

Ai - What's going on?

Hotaru - Yusuke! I just want to talk about this... You were here all the time... You can understand what's going on, but I can't do anything about this...

Yusuke - I just... We... We... We have to...

Hotaru - Let's fight together! I'll save this town! There's something I've been thinking about! A lot of people are having to fight, because they don't have a place to go back to. We need to fight, so that we can defeat the devil. And then, we can go back to our families. I want to save this town and go back to our families... I need to do something about this town. It's my hometown...

Yusuke - But you and I are the same, and so are we being forced to fight... So let's fight together! There's nothing to feel sad about, because we're going to save the town! Let's fight for the town, Hotaru!

Ai - Hey, Hotaru. Wait. I'm leaving the room. You and Yusuke can take care of this, so let me leave this room. I know how things are. I'm not going to stand in your way.

(Lure)

Hotaru - Ai-san... Where are you going? Are you leaving?

I don't like that... Ai-san, I... This is my hometown! I can't leave it. This is where we are, right? Why did it come to this? I don't like it.

Don't go, Ai-san. I want you to stay here! Please don't go, Ai-san!

(Yusuke)
