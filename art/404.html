Well, that is enough about work.  The big news is that Travis is having a 
boy!!!  It is always good when one of them gets to make the first move.  So 
it is my first and only nephew!!!  We are just overjoyed, but still in 
shock...I think that is what I am trying to say.  The due date is on May 7th 
so we are counting down.  I just saw a boy for the first time this past 
weekend and he has had my attention now for a few days.  Oh by the way, he is 
just about as ugly as a boy can be and he is not at all like a 
Dallas-steeler!  I'll try not to hold that against him.

I am sorry you did not have a good time in Austin.  I do hope that I get to 
see a little more of the city and spend some time with you when I am up for 
the Dads and Grads. (I am going to try and get up that way in August too.) 

Talk with you soon.

Love,

Julie
