All publications cited in this application are herein incorporated by reference.
There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possesses the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single variety an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to drought and heat, and better agronomic quality.
Choice of breeding or selection methods depends on the mode of plant reproduction, the heritability of the trait(s) being improved, and the type of cultivar used commercially (e.g., F1 hybrid cultivar, pureline cultivar, etc.). For highly heritable traits, a choice of superior individual plants evaluated at a single location will be effective, whereas for traits with low heritability, selection should be based on mean values obtained from replicated evaluations of families of related plants. Popular selection methods commonly include pedigree selection, modified pedigree selection, mass selection, and recurrent selection.
The complexity of inheritance influences choice of the breeding method. Backcross breeding is used to transfer one or a few favorable genes for a highly heritable trait into a desirable cultivar. This approach has been used extensively for breeding disease-resistant cultivars. Various recurrent selection techniques are used to improve quantitatively inherited traits controlled by numerous genes. The use of recurrent selection in self-pollinating crops depends on the ease of pollination, the frequency of successful hybrids from each pollination and the number of hybrid offspring from each successful cross.
Each breeding program should include a periodic, objective evaluation of the efficiency of the breeding procedure. Evaluation criteria vary depending on the goal and objectives, but should include gain from selection per year based on comparisons to an appropriate standard, overall value of the advanced breeding lines, and number of successful cultivars produced per unit of input (e.g., per year, per dollar expended, etc.).
Promising advanced breeding lines are thoroughly tested and compared to appropriate standards in environments representative of the commercial target area(s) for three or more years. The best lines are candidates for new commercial cultivars; those still deficient in a few traits may be used as parents to produce new populations for further selection.
These processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, usually take from eight to 12 years from the time the first cross is made. Therefore, development of new cultivars is a time-consuming process that requires precise forward planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction.
A most difficult task is the identification of individuals that are genetically superior, because for most traits the true genotypic value is masked by other confounding plant traits or environmental factors. One method of identifying a superior plant is to observe its performance relative to other experimental plants and to a widely grown standard cultivar. If a single observation is inconclusive, replicated observations provide a better estimate of its genetic worth.
The goal of soybean plant breeding is to develop new, unique and superior soybean cultivars and hybrids. The breeder initially selects and crosses two or more parental lines, followed by repeated selfing and selection, producing many new genetic combinations. The breeder can theoretically generate billions of different genetic combinations via crossing, selection, selfing and mutations. Therefore, a breeder will never develop the same line, or even very similar lines, having the same soybean traits from the exact same parents.
Each year, the plant breeder selects the germplasm to advance to the next generation. This germplasm is grown under unique and different geographical, climatic and soil conditions and continually challenged by shoot and root diseases, insect damage and unfavorable weather conditions. The breeder continually searches for new superior soybean cultivars and hybrids to advance the industry.
The present invention is a novel soybean cultivar designated as xe2x80x9803160134xe2x80x99. This invention thus relates to the seeds of soybean cultivar 03160134, f to the plants of soybean cultivar 03160134 and to methods for producing a soybean plant produced by crossing the soybean 03160134 a further soybean cultivar.
The invention is also directed to soybean cultivar 03160134 further comprising one or more desirable traits. Soybean cultivar 03160134 has semi-hirsute and yellow pigmentation pattern and exhibits semi-early and full resistance to Soybean Cyst Nematode, as well as having resistance to Roundup(trademark) herbicide. Soybean cultivar 03160134 has advantages over other soybean cultivars, particularly with respect to its semi-hirsute and yellow pigmentation pattern, resistance to Soybean Cyst Nematode, as well as resistance to Roundup(trademark) herbicide. Soybean cultivar 03160134 is resistant to glyphosate herbicide while retaining a positive yield potential.
In the description and tables that follow, a number of terms are used. In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, including the scope to be given such terms, the following definitions are provided:
Maturity Date. Plants are considered mature when 95% of the pods have reached their mature color.
Seed Yield (Bushels/Acre). The yield in bushels/acre is the actual yield of the grain at harvest.
Lodging Resistance. Lodging is rated on a scale of 1 to 5. Where one is least lodging resistant and five is most lodging resistant.
Phytophthora Tolerance. Tolerance to Phytophthora root rot is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with a score of 1 being the best or highest tolerance ranging down to a score of 5 which indicates the plants have no tolerance to Phytophthora.
Emergence. This score indicates the ability of the seed to emerge when planted, relative to other soybean cultivars, and is based on a number of factors, including disease resistance, emergence temperature, variety
Plant Height. Plant height is taken from the top of the soil to top pod of the plant and is measured in inches.
Dropped Ears. This is a measure of the number of dropped ears per plot and represents one of the most important factors of yield. Dropped ears are defined as those which hang down from the stalk and may or may not be attached to the stem. The number of dropped ears is recorded as hang drops.
Grain Weight. Grain yield is expressed in bushels per acre.
Plant Width. This indicates the size of the plant in inches (xe2x80x9cinxe2x80x9d), and is measured in inches along a vertical axis.
Pod dehiscence. Pod dehiscence refers to the amount of pod dehiscence, or splitting of pod wall, and is measured as the percentage of pods which open before maturity. Pod dehiscence can be caused by many factors.
Weight of Shelled Maturity. This indicates the average weight of the shelled grain when mature.
Moisture Test. This test is conducted on a 10-bean sample. A 2.0-gram sample of grain is placed inside a container and exposed to an environment with a relative humidity of 70% for 24 hours. The container is then weighed to determine its moisture content. The percentage of water in the grain sample is calculated as follows: grain sample weightxe2x80x94grain sample moisture content (g)xc3x97100/grain sample weight.
Lodging Resistance (LR). Lodging resistance is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where a score of 1 indicates the plants have a complete root ball, and a score of 5 indicates the plants have no root ball whatsoever.
Seeds per Pound. Soybean seeds vary in seed size, therefore, the number of seeds required to make up one pound also varies. This affects the pounds of seed required to plant a given area, and can also impact end uses.
Color. Color refers to seed color, eye color, leaf color and pubescence color.
Yield (Bushels/Acre). Yield is an important factor in determining how much acreage of a particular bean variety is required to produce an adequate supply of that variety. On the other hand, how much other type of yield (e.g., seed yield, dry matter yield or oil yield) is important also depends on the variety and the purpose for which the bean is to be used.
The amount of seed planted in accordance with this invention is chosen from a range of levels that are determined by the particular end use for which the new bean variety is intended. In addition, the new bean variety can be used for the above purpose or any other purpose.
All traits are considered in the ranking of varieties, in the selection of superior varieties, and in determining yield potential of an improved variety.
The general purpose of the present invention is to provide a new and distinct variety of soybean (genotype A1506xc2x715) designated 03160134 which has broad and very firm pubescence, lodging resistance, and which produces an excellent yield (5 lb/a) with resistance to Phytophthora root rot.
