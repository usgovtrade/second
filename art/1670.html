# _To My Wife_

> On a February morning, after a night of severe  
>  blizzard, a few hours of blistering heat,  
>  snow melting away as we talked  
>  on the living room couch, our heads  
>  turned away to either side,  
>  I heard snow beginning to slip off the roof,  
>  its dull and monotonous sound like breathing  
>  as it melted slowly, steadily,  
>  making room for the sun. When a patch  
>  of snow at the edge of the roof, at the very  
>  edge, fell away, I closed my eyes.  
>  You said that it was only the chimney breathing.

# _Sketches of Dresden_

> For some time now I've been trying to recall  
>  my last meeting with the writer Hesselberg,  
>  who was always known as Harry, and also  
>  Sebastian. He used to talk about this:  
>  I don't know what he meant when he said: "We're  
>  going to the country to find out how little  
>   we really know about everything." I'd like  
>  to remember where we went,  
>  and what time of day it was,  
>  and why we went to that country at all.

> We had a conversation about a man  
>  named Pessagno, whom I was with in Dresden  
>  three or four times. I'm not at all  
>  sure of the time and place. At that time  
>  I didn't know how to remember very much,  
>  and yet I was always happy to see  
>  Hesselberg or Sebastian. Their friendship  
>  was my own, and yet I am able to think  
>  of myself as a separate being. "So that's  
>  how it works." A very strange thing.  
>  In the end I think I have done what we do  
>  in the face of nothing but death:  
>  I've lived on and on and on.

> I said it was a cold day,  
>  that the wind was blowing; that the sky was  
>  thick with cumulus clouds and the trees in  
>  full bloom. That it was spring.  
>  And I said: "All three things are true."

# _Two Scenes in Dresden_

> We were walking home from a house on the outskirts  
>  of town. You said we were walking toward the town  
>  and I said we were walking away. Then I began to wonder  
>  why you hadn't ever written a poem.  
>  This was the way I imagined that conversation,  
>  and yet this has nothing to do with what I meant  
>  when I told you once: _I don't understand,  
>   you must write your poems for yourself, I need you  
>  to write, please_." That afternoon I saw the two  
>  of us at the edge of a town built on sand and water.  
>  I didn't understand. The first thing  
>  I did was go home. When I awoke the next morning  
>  I found that my love had finally begun to write,  
>  and she had asked me to come to her by telephone,  
>  from time to time. I asked her not to give  
>  up what she'd begun so that I might see it.

> I said we were walking up the narrow street,  
>  a short distance from the home we were visiting,  
>  we were walking toward the town, the town

# _In Dresden_

> I said we were walking up the narrow street  
>  while everyone who saw us began to say  
>  that the two of us were walking toward the town.  
>  The town's been going on without us.

# _In Dresden_

> I said we were walking along the river,  
>  the river was running by itself.  
>  The birds chirped in the distance.  
>  The birds continued to chirp.

> The train was leaving in a few hours. I said:  
>  It's cold. We can't stand the cold here.  
>  I asked you to remember all those other times,  
>  when we were both together, and now  
>  we would be standing at some distance from each other.  
>  These are the times when we forget  
>  that we are part of a bigger picture,  
>  that things happen not just to us,  
>  but to all of us.

> I walked down the street where everyone is  
>  saying: "The birds are all in love, the birds are

> I'm sure I didn't remember anything.
