The film was a huge success at the box office. It also featured one of the first appearances of Noel Purcell (who later became more famous for his roles in Captain Blood and The Prisoner, in addition to a career as a comedian in The Benny Hill Show) as Tadgh's friend and would be a recurring character in many future projects.

Morgan played a supporting role as Cathy's father in the 1960 science-fiction film When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth.

Later that year he had the part of Mike, a young Scottish immigrant in the 1960 episode of the anthology television series "Appointment with Adventure" adapted from the book by John Creasy.  Although not a top ten hit, "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" was notable for having been a movie-of-the-week released on American television rather than in the usual theatres.

1960s
In 1960, Morgan appeared in The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll, another role that established his status as a villainous lead. His last major role was as the ruthless Dr. Noel in 1961's Dr. No, the second film in the James Bond series of adventure films. It was this film which helped to establish Morgan as a movie villain in the public mind and set the tone for the entire series; he was also the only British actor in the role. Morgan reprised his role in Dr. No's two sequels Dr. No (1962) and From Russia with Love (1963). He appeared as the character of Riffraff in the 1961 pilot episode of the Western television series The Man From Blackhawk, starring Gary Lockwood.

Morgan played a minor role as King Rostock, an Atlantean, in the 1962 film version of Shark Tale, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tempest, in which he played opposite actor Orson Welles. He also appeared in the 1962 British musical biographical film The Greatest Story Ever Told, starring and produced by Charles M. Schulz.

In 1965, he appeared in the role of the lead character in the science-fiction film Panic in Year Zero!.

In 1965, he also appeared in a series of films, starting with The Tomb of Ligeia as the mysterious Professor Bockman who is actually Ligeia (brought back from the dead by black magic). This was followed by his second part in another mystery adaptation, The Haunting with Eva Bartok. That same year, Morgan starred as Jack "the Dog-Faced Boy" opposite Samantha Eggar in the horror classic The Three Faces of Eve.

In 1966, Morgan reprised his role as Dr. Noel in two films, starring opposite Joan Collins as Hercule Poirot in the whodunit and mystery-themed film Murder Ahoy!. He also appeared in The Sinister Stranger, and The Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow.

He made his last feature film appearance in 1969 in For Those Who Think Young and a guest appearance on Bonanza.

Later life and death
Morgan was among those profiled in the 1968 documentary film The Devil's Agents, about the Mundas tribe of Papua New Guinea. He also appeared in another documentary, We Do Things Differently, narrated by Morgan, shot in 1967 but not released until 1972. He featured alongside other stars such as Peter Sellers, Michael Caine and Eric Sykes. A documentary was also made of Morgan's early years in show business called The Showman.

Morgan was considered as one of the two choices for the villain part of James Bond, which was eventually taken by George Lazenby. He was mentioned by Sean Connery as one of the possibilities for the role.

Morgan's first marriage, in 1959, to Barbara Ellen Brice produced two children, Timothy and Jane.

Morgan and Brice were divorced in 1965. He later married Ruth Ellen Earp, with whom he remained until his death.

Morgan died in a car accident on December 24, 1972, near his home at 855 Cedar Street in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA.

Legacy
On 14 September 2017, "Timothy Morgan" was named as one of the stars of the BBC Radio 4 soap opera The Archers, in reference to him playing Dr. Noel in the film Dr. No.

He is included in the video of "We're getting married in the morning" (as the lead singer with The Tornados) in 1969.
