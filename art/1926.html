<P>I can confirm, I have a Roamio, and I just upgraded to the latest FW.&nbsp; Before the upgrade, the Roamio would shut down when you wanted it to, after the upgrade it will never shut down, or reboot, or even enter it's power-off state</P>Mon, 13 Sep 2016 21:03:48 GMThttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402904#M3707Flipperfish2016-09-13T21:03:48ZRe: Tivo will not power offhttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402907#M3708
<P>It is the tivo service itself that will not shut down. it still does everything else including recordings. You must go into the service menu and "set the power to off" to stop the service.</P>
<P>And, I agree it does not look good that the Roamio won't be fully working for days now.</P>Mon, 13 Sep 2016 21:05:11 GMThttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402907#M3708Flipperfish2016-09-13T21:05:11ZRe: Tivo will not power offhttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402908#M3709
<P>I upgraded mine last night as well and noticed that mine will no longer shut down with the button or the power off menu, however, mine still does everything else including recordings just like the owner of the post above. It's just that my unit doesn't sleep when put to sleep at the end of the night anymore which is causing some issues. As with the case above, I too have a Roamio Plus which was a great product in its time but its replacement is just not up to par. I don't expect perfection but I can't fathom that Tivo is going to be out this long.</P>Mon, 13 Sep 2016 21:08:28 GMThttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402908#M3709Flipperfish2016-09-13T21:08:28ZRe: Tivo will not power offhttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402909#M3710
<P>I have a Roamio Pro and I will say that I have had the same issue for over a week now...I just checked it tonight and it will not power off no matter how many times I try.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>I don't have any option to force a shut down from the CLI or GUI. I just have to wait for the TiVo service to go to 0.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Just an FYI to all.</P>Mon, 13 Sep 2016 21:09:36 GMThttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402909#M3710DanStorrar2016-09-13T21:09:36ZRe: Tivo will not power offhttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402911#M3711
<P>Thanks Flipper.</P><P>On the Roamio Pro, I can power it off by using the menu. But the screen is stuck. I cant see the time and temp. in the middle. Just the menu and Tv and what not. That was happening with the new update as well.</P><P>I can&rsquo;t really be sure about my Roamio Plus, but I know it has a screen. The screen is black and stuck at the beginning of the Tivo logo, so I can just imagine the screen is unresponsive.</P>Mon, 13 Sep 2016 21:15:06 GMThttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402911#M3711DanStorrar2016-09-13T21:15:06ZRe: Tivo will not power offhttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402912#M3712
<P>I'll bump this one also.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Tivo.com has had no response from customer support or the forum.</P><P>Last night I found out that I can power off my Roamio Plus with a keystroke from my Android tablet. I don't know if you guys can call that a fix for this, but its working.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>This is my last Tivo product I had hopes for because it is absolutely NOT customer service or support friendly.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>I'd bet this is the same problem that some people with different models are having.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>My Roamio Plus will still show all other programs until I select my Roamio Plus and then it will show the logo.

<P>Yeah, I can confirm that you can shut down with a keystroke on Android as well. I've even done it on my iPhone 4s.&nbsp;</P><P>I've had this issue for a few weeks now. Glad I found it. My other TiVo was an older box, and there's a possibility I might look for a deal on the Roamio OTA.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>I'm happy to wait an hour or two for the service to go down and then I'll just have to shut it off with a keystroke, and then run another update.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Very bizarre...</P>Mon, 13 Sep 2016 21:19:17 GMThttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402914#M3713DanStorrar2016-09-13T21:19:17ZRe: Tivo will not power offhttps://community.tivo.com/t5/Tivo-Technical-Issues-and-Bugs/Tivo-will-not-power-off/m-p/402915#M3714
<P>Funny you should mention that.&nbsp; I'm on a 3 year contract with a Tivo Roamio.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Just this morning I started the update to Roamio Pro (was Tivo Premiere for almost 4 years).&nbsp; After install, I get a message that an update failed.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>In my research, I was hoping to find a setting in the settings to disable auto sleep.
