the ever-increasing demand for our technology. 
For this reason we look for the solution to the problem of finding a good 
solution for every possible problem. 
One possibility is a web-based model. 
In the short term, the market situation is not yet clear: there are some 
positive signs such as customers' demand for the model. 
I think it is not only an "excuse" or "solution" but an "objective" to offer 
products and services that are of great value to customers. 
We don't just make a good company, but a company of the best 
possible value. 
It must be said that all solutions must be technically viable: 
if a solution is not possible, it must not be applied. 
However, the solution to the problem of finding the right solution is a 
challenge to all human abilities.

I think of this as a process of continuous development, so I am sure it will 
continue to exist.

In this case it seems to me that "solutions for all problems" is just a buzzword. At least according to a Google search it seems to be just used to sell stuff.
You might also say that there is an ever-increasing demand for your technology, but a better word choice for your situation would be "overcome the challenge of adapting to an ever-increasing number of ever-changing challenges".

Not exactly a definition but in the words of Douglas Adams:

Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.

In case someone thinks I'm hijacking my own question with the above answer, here's a very useful example of your question.

solving every problem - the solution must be applicable to every problem

So, imagine you have a problem:  If I were to sell enough apples to my business clients to pay for your application for every user, what would your business model be?

I like the example mentioned in the other post as well. Let's say we have software to solve "business problems" (sounds like a contradiction in terms, right?) and one of them is "to create a business model". I would add a word for it, but what?

This is another good question, which can't be answered in your question: what is a business model?
You need a proper definition of it so that you can put a proper term into your question. I suggest reading the wikipedia article about business models or perhaps the book by Richard D'Aveni (a Harvard Business School Professor), Managing for Business Growth, which is very good for definitions.

As for the definition of business model given in the original question, it's not really that useful:

a set of assumptions and a collection of resources that an organization can apply to achieve its goals (an organization may have one or more business models)

I would suggest rephrasing it as follows:

An organization will have one or more business models for achieving its goals. The business model is a set of assumptions and a collection of resources that an organization can apply to achieve its goals.

Hope it helps.

Update:

If you're looking for a way to express your business model in software, you could express the concept of a business model in the form of a software component. Then any number of business models could be applied to business and project needs. The key word in this case is design pattern.
