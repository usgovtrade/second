Bananas come in a lot of sizes, but regardless of shape, they're easy to store, and one banana will keep up to five days when stored in the refrigerator. Use the ripest one you can find to ensure you don't get a bad banana.

To ripen a bunch of bananas, leave them at room temperature until they yield when lightly squeezed, or give them a gentle thump with a closed fist. Don't use the soft spot to judge ripeness; when bananas are ripe enough to eat, you don't want any part of the fruit to be green. The yellow spot on the bottom will turn brown, the skin will turn speckled brown, and the texture will become mealy.

To store ripe bananas for later use, peel the fruit and cut in half. Store in a plastic bag. If the bananas are in one big clump, squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible and transfer the fruit to a paper bag. Peel any black spots from the bananas before using.

Banana skins have natural enzymes, which start turning fruit brown once it's picked. To delay the discoloration process, place cut bananas in a paper bag and seal. For brown bananas, store them in the refrigerator.

The brown spots that you'll sometimes see on ripe bananas are the result of bruising. To prevent bruising, make sure that you store the fruit properly and use appropriate cutting tools. Wrap the bananas tightly in plastic wrap, and when you're ready to use them, cut off the ends, slice in half, and drop into boiling water for a few seconds.

## Batch Baking

### Batch Basics

#### The Batch Challenge

Here's a simple rule that can help you turn a kitchen chore into a pleasure: batch bake when you can. I say "when you can" because baking can be a challenge. It takes a lot of energy and skill, and it takes a kitchen that's at a consistent temperature and humidity. Even just cooking an egg and making toast isn't simple.

Batch baking can be easier. For example, my friends know that they can count on me to feed them a lovely brunch every few weeks in my home. They can do this because I'm confident that I can make a variety of breakfast dishes without running out of fuel or ingredients. Knowing that I have an arsenal of recipes in the freezer means that I'll have something tasty to offer when I'm called upon to host brunch—or dinner, for that matter.

While you may not be running a brunch buffet every week, batch baking is very handy when you want to prepare a big meal at the last minute. You can pre-measure ingredients and pop them into the oven one by one, allowing you to spend more time doing other things. This also allows you to spend your time preparing the dish, instead of cleaning up after it's gone.

Batch baking means that you're not rushed and it's easier on your oven and yourself. It also means that if the oven is already on, you can pull out a casserole or loaf of bread, set it on the countertop, and get back to your other work—a great opportunity to put that kettle of boiling water on the back burner. When all is said and done, batch baking is a great way to create a delicious meal.

What's more, preparing lots of things at once also means that you can experiment with new recipes, keep track of what works and what doesn't, and get a good idea of how long dishes take to bake and whether they're worth your time. When you do the same things over and over again, you can get very good at them. But when you mix it up and try new recipes, it's like starting over from scratch, and you'll learn a lot from your mistakes as well.

#### Preparing for Batch Baking

Whether you're baking bread, cookies, pies, casseroles, cakes, or something else, there are a few things to know when you bake multiple things in the same day. This also applies to frozen or canned items.

It's always a good idea to label your food containers with the date and what they are; having a list of recipes to pull from will help save time. Keeping a few labels handy so you can record the date you started them is very important.

In the kitchen, I always label the top of my measuring cup and the lids of my jars. When I make soup, I put the recipe name on the soup can lid, and I make sure that I use a different soup can lid for each recipe. That way I can use up the leftovers of any number of soups. It's a system that I just can't seem to get rid of, and it makes batch baking easier.

As you can see, you can get extremely organized about your baking. In fact, if you are an extremely organized person, you can plan on baking only when your oven is already preheating. This may sound strange, but it works for me. Sometimes my oven needs to be at around 325 degrees or so before I get started with the cookies, and if it's not preheated, I have to wait a little while. It's worth it to save some extra time. In fact, the most important thing about cooking is doing it consistently, and batch baking is the perfect way to ensure that you're consistent.

#### How to Bake Batch Cooking

Cooking or baking something while your oven is in use can take a little longer because your oven might need to be restarted more often. You don't need to change your oven temperature settings, just make sure that it's thoroughly preheated before you begin to bake.

### Batch Baking Tools

Whether you're baking at home or at work, some basic baking tools will help to ensure that you succeed.

**The baking sheets and pans** that are used most often are 8 x 8 inches (20 x 20 cm) round metal pans and 9 x 13 inch (23 x 33 cm) or 13 x 9 inch (33 x 23 cm) pans. If you have a baking sheet or pan that isn't round, square baking pans or pans with a lid usually work best because they're easier to turn. Baking sheets can come in a variety of sizes, so it's a good idea to have a few.

**The mixing bowl** that you use to mix the ingredients in can be plastic or glass. Baking is a good time to get creative with your baking tools, especially if you're baking a recipe that you've never made before. Some people enjoy mixing with wooden spoons, for example, and others use metal ones. There are lots of new tools available that make cookie baking easier, including dough scrapers and pizza cutters.

**Food molds** aren't strictly necessary when baking, but they can make it easier to make individual desserts and breads without using a lot of fuss.

**The oven thermometer** ensures that you have enough time to clean your oven and that your baking is done properly. It also alerts you when the oven is not at the temperature that you set it at, preventing your food from getting too hot or too cold.

**The ruler** makes it easy to line baking pans with waxed paper and makes it easy to make your baking even.

**The aluminum foil or baking parchment** is handy for lining your baking sheet to prevent the food from sticking, as well as keeping the moisture away from your kitchen counters. Don't forget to take off the paper before you put your dishes in the oven. It's best to line the baking sheet with foil and take off the paper after you've filled the pan.

**The measuring cups** come in handy when you bake. You can also use liquid measures and dry measure cups.

**The wooden spoons** and wooden kitchen tools add to the comfort factor. Be sure to label your tools and keep them in a safe place so you can find them when you're baking.

**An oven thermometer** is very useful in making sure that you're cooking on a hot enough heat for the foods that you're baking.

**The pastry bags** can be a bit finicky. If they don't hold airtight, they will not stay closed when you're ready to make your dessert.

**An oven rack** is a necessity in your kitchen and usually comes with your oven. An oven rack is a tool that makes it easy to slide your dishes into the oven and to clean your oven.

**Electric cake decorating** attachments are fantastic gadgets that make decorating your cakes so easy and fast. If you have an electric mixer and cake decorating attachments, you can even decorate the cakes as you bake them.
