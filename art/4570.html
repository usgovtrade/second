When a mobile communication device (xe2x80x9cMDxe2x80x9d) such as a cellular phone is idle (i.e., not in use), the MD can be connected to an access point (xe2x80x9cAPxe2x80x9d) on a wireless local area network (xe2x80x9cLANxe2x80x9d). Using this approach, the MD will receive a service profile from the AP for the LAN on which the MD is currently connected. The service profile provides information about how to connect to the Internet, an intranet, etc., via the AP, to obtain access to services such as electronic mail, text messaging, etc. While it is beneficial for MD users to have some guidance on how to access different services, the current provisioning process does not provide complete guidance on how to access the services.
The AP on a LAN is configured to send to the MD only certain data to be stored in the service profile. For example, when the MD is first connected, a minimal set of the service profile data is sent to the MD. After that, the MD may periodically receive additional data. The MD will not receive all of the service profile data until it receives the data again from the AP. If the MD has already connected to a LAN to obtain service and later has to reconnect for one reason or another, the MD will not receive the data if it has not previously been received. Thus, the MD is likely to not have a complete and up-to-date service profile that contains all of the available access information.
As a result, the MD will not always have up-to-date information about the services that are available on the network. When a user needs to connect to an intranet, the user may have to make a guess as to how to reach the intranet and may therefore waste valuable time in reaching the intranet.
In view of the above, there is a need for a method and system for automatically filling out a service profile for an MD, whereby the MD receives all necessary data to be stored in the service profile.
One embodiment of the present invention is a method for automatically establishing a wireless communication session between an MD and a service provider via a base station or access point (xe2x80x9cAPxe2x80x9d) on a local network when the MD is idle. When the MD is first connected to the AP, a predetermined portion of the service profile is sent to the MD, along with information concerning how the service profile is to be updated. The MD, when idle, determines if it is in a second local network. If so, the MD receives a second predetermined portion of the service profile from the AP via the second local network. If not, the MD receives the first predetermined portion of the service profile. In either case, the MD stores the service profile. In response to subsequent occurrences of a predetermined trigger condition, the MD checks the service profile to determine if the MD is authorized to access the second local network.
Another embodiment of the present invention is a computer readable storage medium having computer readable instructions stored thereon that, when executed, cause a system to automatically establish a wireless communication session between an MD and a service provider via a base station or access point (xe2x80x9cAPxe2x80x9d) on a local network when the MD is idle. The computer readable instructions include computer readable code to cause the system to send a predetermined portion of the service profile to the MD, along with information concerning how the service profile is to be updated, when the MD first connects to the AP. The computer readable instructions also include computer readable code to cause the system to receive the predetermined portion of the service profile and update the service profile when the MD is connected to the AP. The computer readable instructions further include computer readable code to cause the system to send the service profile to the MD. In response to subsequent occurrences of a predetermined trigger condition, the computer readable instructions cause the system to determine if the MD is authorized to access the second local network. The computer readable instructions also cause the system to send to the MD a second portion of the service profile via a second local network, if authorized. The computer readable instructions further cause the system to send a portion of the service profile to the MD via the second local network if it is determined that the MD is not authorized to access the second local network.
The above and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description of a best mode embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:45
