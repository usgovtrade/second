going to pursue a career in the stock market.  You need to learn that 
somewhere in this world, somebody, perhaps a very good friend, knows of an 
advantageous position and a stock, and you never heard of it.  Now let's talk 
about the job change, which is now not the job you said you applied for when 
we interviewed you last.  Your job at Enron was to pick stocks and to trade 
them.  Apparently, this activity is not going to occur.  However, I am sure 
that there are many other companies that require the same skills you 
possessed.  The company may have offered you a job for other reasons, but the 
bottom line is that they chose not to fill that position at this time.  
There's no bad blood, at least not on my end.  Enron has a lot of opportunities 
available.  Not every employee is selected for every position that becomes 
available.  I've moved on and am now Director of Producer Services for Mobil 
Corporation.  Hope all is well with you, and you take care.

Dear Jeff:

Thank you for getting back to me.  I do understand the reasons for the delay.

I have a final interview set up with Chris Croom on Thursday of this week at
4:30 PM (he'll be out of the office until Thursday).  Please let me know if
you have any interest in meeting him.  He has a Ph.D. in Applied
Mathematics and is a certified Quantitative Analyst.  He did his graduate
work at UT.  He also did a 2 1/2 year analyst rotation at Koch.

He will be with the Natural Gas Group.

Best regards.

Maureen Raymond-Castaneda
