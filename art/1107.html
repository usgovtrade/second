If your answer is YES, then you are going to want to book this offer.
For one week only, you will receive the chance to experience one of my most unique and intimate photo experiences. I will be joining forces with the lovely Danielle of Domenick Photography to create a custom sunset wedding photo session in one of our favourite locations - Wreck Beach.
The session is limited to 20 couples who are in love with each other and are ready to do something crazy and fun for the sake of love.
What makes this a super special experience?
You'll be getting an intimate portrait session at sunset at one of my most amazing locations in Vancouver, coupled with me teaching you how to feel comfortable and beautiful as a couple!
During the class portion of the experience, you and your partner will learn how to express yourselves and feel natural around each other in front of the camera. It will be about 90 minutes long, so you will have plenty of time to connect and create memories together.
No problem! Every person that's participating will have their own camera (or smartphone). At the end of the experience, Danielle will be sharing her top tips and posing techniques with you so you can continue creating beautiful memories after the sunset wedding photo session!
Your wedding anniversary and this experience will be something that you can look back on fondly and remember how much fun you had together during the session.
Let's take a walk on the wild side for a change. How do you like that? :)
Danielle of Domenick Photography will also be joining us and creating magical portraits for us as well. She is known to create stunning, high quality images for weddings, engagements, boudoir, families, babies and more.

When he finished, he made them drink some tea and sat down again.
“I could use a little something to eat,” I said.
“You and everyone else,” he said. “But look, it’s almost dinner time anyway.” He grinned a lopsided smile that reminded me of how he used to look when we were kids and we all used to play tag in the streets of Brooklyn and nobody worried about being run over by cars. “What do you want to eat?”
I looked around. I did a quick inventory of all the items in the kitchen and realized that maybe I should just choose one thing and order out for dinner. I couldn’t think of anything else that sounded good and would fill me up enough to make it through the following day, which was when our guests were set to arrive for my brother’s wedding. “Whatever you suggest,” I said.
“Oh, fine. What do you usually order?”
“What? It’s one of your favourite dishes and we both know it. Just say it!”
I grinned at him. “I don’t usually eat Chinese food. Not anymore, at least. Now I mostly eat organic salad, lentils and brown rice. I know, I know—very boring and uncultured, right?”
He laughed. “I wouldn’t say so. Well, in fact, if you really want to get into the gourmet thing, you should try Ethiopian food sometime. I think you would really love it! But first I thought we should have some more tea and a few dates, since they should still be available from the desert land over there. Then we could drive home in a few minutes and eat dinner. That sounds like a plan to me!” He smiled, then his eyes got serious again. “Are you feeling all right, my love? Are you getting enough rest? It must be really hard to get used to the jet lag, especially after such a long flight.”
“I’m sure I will be fine,” I said. “Once I’ve had some more sleep tonight, everything should be back to normal again.”
He shook his head in disbelief. “It’s amazing to me that a person as healthy and strong as you, who walks at least a mile every day on her lunch break and swims laps when she can, can still be so tired. Especially after taking such a long trip overseas. And then having to go back to work right away! I don’t even know how you do it!”
I shrugged off his concern. “I have good genes, I guess. Mom and Dad are both in their sixties and they still go to the gym and do yoga every day. You know that dad of yours is in better shape than most guys a decade younger than him!”
“It’s not exactly like that, sweetie. The last time I saw him, he was very sick.”
I frowned. “What do you mean? What happened to him? He was only in his forties and he looked like a runner!”
I could hear the sadness in his voice as he answered. “He passed away from pancreatic cancer, honey. You know how close I am to my dad and how hard it was for me to see him go, even though I know it was a good thing for him because he couldn’t handle being sick anymore. He did not want to die! That guy practically lived on salads and lentils all his life and now it ended up being too much for his body to handle.”
