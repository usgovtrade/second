"So I'm going to find out why this happened to me." "I don't know, Charlie, maybe it's just a coincidence." "Not even a year goes by that someone close to me doesn't leave me." "I've lost friends before." "Yeah, but you never had anything like this happen." "I don't want to lose you." "So let's just get the hell out of here, right now, together." "Come on." "All right, Charlie." "All right." "I love you." "I love you." "All right." "I love you too." "You're sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?" "Like what?" "I don't know, where you went after we got separated at the bar, what you did?" "Nothing I can remember." "I have no idea." "You don't have to protect me." "I know." "It's just the last few days, I've been trying to figure out" "Oh, my God, this is so gross." "what's wrong with me." "Don't answer that." "Hello?" "Charlie, it's Gerry." "I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours." "What do you mean?" "You were in an accident, in Malibu." "What?" "You were in a car accident." "You're hurt." "What--?" "What happened?" "Nothing." "There was no accident." "It was a hit and run driver, Charlie." "You were hurt, but you're gonna be okay." "My God, are you all right?" "Yeah, I'm fine." "Charlie, listen to me." "We're at a hospital." "You need to get here as soon as you can." "Uh, yeah, all right." "No, I'm coming right now." "Goodbye, Charlie." "Who was that?" "He hung up." "Call back." "This is a bad dream." "This has to be a bad dream." "Okay, let's get you up." "Just lie back." "Here you go." "Head up." "Hey." "Are you okay?" "What happened?" "I don't know, it's crazy." "I'm gonna go find out, I'm gonna be right back, okay?" "You keep that on." "Okay?" "Everything's okay, everything's gonna be okay." "Charlie, you're awake." "I got here as quick as I could." "What happened?" "I don't know, I ran out of gas." "I pulled in." "And someone hit me from the back." "They took my wallet and my phone and they took my keys." "And I" "Did you see who it was?" "No, they were wearing masks." "The police are on their way." "I wanna take you to the hospital, but you're gonna have to ride with us." "I don't have my car." "I'm really sorry, but I don't have my car." "But you said you got your license yesterday." "Yeah, yeah, but it's at home." "I could take you home, and then get your car, if you" "No, it's okay." "Hey, hey." "What's wrong with your feet?" "There's nothing wrong with my feet." "Are you bleeding?" "No, it's all right." "What's all right?" "Your feet, what's wrong with them?" "Charlie, they're broken." "Okay?" "Okay." "Okay." "Yeah, but why?" "Hey, did you hear that?" "That voice?" "Did you hear that?" "What voice?" "I don't hear anything." "Charlie?" "Charlie." "Get in there, I'll hold 'em off." "Go!" "Get him!" "Get him!" "Charlie, go!" "Charlie, come on!" "Charlie!" "I don't hear anything!" "Run!" "Run!" "Run!" "Come on, Charlie, run!" "Get in, get in!" "Go!" "Get in, get in!" "It's locked!" "Charlie, go!" "Charlie, go!" "Charlie, get out of the car!" "He's coming!" "No, he's not." "Step on it!" "Go!" "Go!" "Run!" "Now he's chasing us." "What is he doing?" "Why is he doing this to us?" "He's just crazy, okay?" "Just drive." "Don't speed!" "He's right behind us!" "Step on the gas!" "What?" "Step on the gas, he's gonna get hit." "The guy died." "It was him." "Charlie." "It was him." "I saw him." "He tried to kill us!" "He was wearing his mask." "The guy died." "His car crashed, okay?" "It wasn't him!" "It wasn't him." "Yes, it was him." "Yes, it was." "No, Charlie, it's okay." "I saw him too, he was right there, okay?" "He was right behind us." "He was wearing his mask, okay?" "Okay?" "He was trying to kill us." "He wanted to kill us." "We gotta get you someplace safe, okay?" "Someplace safe." "Come on, come on, come on, come on." "Charlie!" "Charlie, I need your help!" "Do you hear me?" "I need your help." "Don't leave me." "Come on." "Charlie, come on." "Get up, get up." "Get up." "Please don't leave me." "Don't leave me." "Charlie, come on." "Charlie, don't leave me!" "Charlie, Charlie." "Charlie, stay with me!" "Charlie, Charlie." "Charlie!" "Charlie, don't leave me, Charlie!" "Charlie!" "This is a good hospital." "We gotcha." "She was in Malibu, and we got her to the hospital, and everything's gonna be okay." "Listen, we're gonna take care of you now, okay?" "I don't want you to worry about anything." "Doctor says you're gonna be fine, okay?" "So we don't have to say anything." "We don't have to say anything if you don't want." "It's fine." "Really." "How you feeling?" "Okay." "I'm sorry about everything." "I wanted to be with you so much, but I didn't" "I shouldn't have left you alone." "I know." "And it's not your fault." "Yes, it is my fault." "I let him go, and he got away." "It's my fault." "It's not your fault." "It's not anybody's fault." "He's gonna pay for what he did." "Where is he?" "Please tell me." "I'll kill him myself if you want me to." "You're gonna be okay." "We're gonna take care of you." "Where's the driver?" "Look, just tell me what you want, and I'll give you what you need." "I can't tell you what I have to do." "Get in the car." "I've done terrible things, because I had to." "I'm not a good person." "You should know that by now." "I don't expect you to understand me." "Because you're weak, just like him." "Where is he?" "It's Charlie." "It's the same guy I told you about." "He came back, and I thought that he was gonna kill me, but he didn't." "I wasn't supposed to be there, but I was waiting for him, and I saw his car wreck on the road, and I got there just in time to see him get dragged out." "I should have done something, I should have stopped him, but I couldn't." "I ran." "The cops came and I got away." "But he died, and now he's in my head." "And he won't let me go, and I don't want to feel like this anymore." "I don't want to feel like this anymore." "You understand?" "I don't want to feel like this anymore." "Don't worry, you'll be okay." "I'm not worried about me." "I'm worried about you." "When the police are done with you, you'll need someone to take care of you, a friend, or a family." "It's important." "It's important to have someone." "I don't have anyone." "Will you take care of me?" "Of course." "Of course I will." "What's your name?" "Jennifer." "Jennifer?" "You'll be all right, Jennifer." "You'll be all right." "Charlie, I don't" "Charlie, I don't want to be alone again, okay?" "I know." "But you won't be." "You'll be with me." "That's right, okay?" "We're gonna be okay." "Can I help you with something?" "I'm looking for someone." "What's the name?" "Hollis Percy." "Hollis Percy, hmm." "There's no one here by that name." "Well, that's impossible because he died here a few hours ago, in this hospital."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:30
