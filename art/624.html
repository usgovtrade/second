eliminate duplicate data in a Windows network, and we want to apply the 
technology to the entire company.  We would like to have a session at 
Windows 2000 Migration Week to show people the value and use of the 
technology and provide recommendations on its use.  

Please let me know if you would be available for a session of approximately 
1 hour 30 minutes during the Monday morning general session (September 24, 
2000).  If you are available, I will contact the moderator to schedule.

Please let me know.  Thank you.

As I discussed in our telephone conversation, I have tried to run as 
different, specific searches in Google with different keywords to see if I 
can find some published articles or otherwise a resource that we could point 
to from a messaging perspective.  Thus far, I have found articles on 
duplicates and deleted data.  These are as follows: 
OBSOLETE FILES, ERASE OBSOLETE FILES, & DRIVING DEEPLY INTO OLE'S BOOK 
(http://www.searchstrings.com/web/search1?&Key=windows+delete+old+files&Submit=+Go&Go.x=0&Go.y=0&Search=All)

I have also found another site that talks about how to delete duplicates in 
the system, but the steps seem drastic and I am afraid that it is really 
suggesting that you should consider a new machine (http://www.microsoft.com/win2000/
techinfo/duptech1.mspx?catid=10&from=1)

Many Thanks,

Thanks for the response Randal.  Here's my situation: 

User is on PC 
Goes to L drive 
Clicks on public folder 
PC tells him he already has a public folder by that name. He clicks on 
"proceed anyway" 
Browser shows the user's default public folder (usually his in "O:\" 
directory) 
Clicks on a subfolder under that user's default folder 
Exchange shows him his default folder, plus the newly created public folder 
(we created this second folder on the desktop) 
PC user deletes the newly created folder. (can't tell if he is directed to 
the Recycle Bin or not). This causes the exchange public folder to move to 
the desktop. 
The next time the user goes into O:\, he sees his exchange public folder has 
moved to the desktop and his PC has deleted the original folder! 

For example, the user has the following public folders on his O:\ drive: 
Inbox, Calendar, Contacts, and then under Contacts we have Company, 
Contacts (Houston), and Contacts (Remote) folders. When the user goes to 
L:\, he sees the O:\Contacts\Calendar, O:\Contacts\Company, O:\Contacts\
Remote folders. However, when the user then goes to the desktop (or another 
drive) and tries to create another public folder under O:\ (like O:\Contacts 
new folder) and tries to access the server to exchange mail, he will not be 
able to create it. The user sees a message on the screen: "There is another 
folder with the name "Contacts" under the following location: 
O:\Exchange Server\Public Folders 
Please click on "proceed anyways" and delete the new folder "Contacts new 
folder" on the desktop</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:49
