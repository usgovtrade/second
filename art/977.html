thinking about this!" I yelled.
"I'm serious." He replied.

What was I going to do?  I just can't believe he is considering having sex
with her.  I wonder how long it would be before they would be having a baby?
How could he actually be that awful?  I've had my head under water long
enough to know that he's never, ever been faithful to me and now he's going
to let himself be unfaithful.  I don't understand people like him.  I just 
hope he doesn't wake up one day and realize that he is married and then he 
will see what I have to deal with!

I need to talk to him about this. I need to be firm and set some rules down 
with him before he decides to have sex with her. I guess I will call him and
ask him over to the house. I know he will respect me more when I have a
private discussion with him. I think he still loves me and I think he wants
to respect me. He is just having a hard time respecting my morals.

I hate the fact that he is sleeping with her and lying to her. I want him to
know that I know about the two of them. I am just going to make sure he knows
that it will not be tolerated and that he is no longer a philanderer in my
household. I am just so sick and tired of him lying to me and I really
believe he still loves me. He knows I will never bring myself to do it but 
still he lies to her and then tries to act like a hero to his mistress.

I really hope he doesn't have sex with her. That would just be wrong.

I wish I could be with that guy because he gets more ass than all of my
friends put together.

To be quite honest, I didn't know we had so much stuff here. I guess we
never go to the attic or unpack our suitcases, so we just put everything
anywhere we want. It is pretty impressive, right? And that bed is huge. Wow!
When you are used to a king size bed at home, this will definitely seem like
an island in the middle of the ocean. In my opinion, this is going to be the
first place I will spend a good night sleep since we moved in here. I can
smell a bath now. That is what I am going to do. I will bathe and then go
sleep in that bed. I will use that bathroom of course.

I don't know about you but when I want to take a bath, I want to take a
bath. The thought of having to take a shower to go into a bath is too much of
a hassle for me. I want to just sit on the edge of that bed and enjoy every
second of it. It is just too bad that we only have to stay here for a week.

I am just a lazy bum at the end of the day. I didn't want to come out here
to go out, but I really don't have a choice. Now I am here, I have to act
like I am happy. I have to smile at everything that is going on around me. 
I am so sick and tired of doing this in front of people, but it is a big part
of my job. 

So, let's just act like we're happy around each other, ok? 
It's not as if it really matters if you're not happy because I
will still be here no matter what, and I will never find anyone to replace
you. We can pretend to be happy all we want, but I think that I can see your
true personality shine through at times.

I am tired of being here. I really am. This is like a week of hell, but 
I'm going to be strong. I am an actress. I can fake it and even if I am
going to hell in a hand basket, I will still be a professional. 
Besides, if my looks go, I'll just play a ghost and no one will have to see
me.

We should go to the club. I know some of the guys in the club. 
It is always fun to go there. I am not a party kind of girl. I go to the
club with no intention of drinking. There are always people trying to talk to
me and I just ignore them. I just want to go to the bar, get my drink, pay
for it, and go home. I don't really talk to people there, but I have gotten
pretty good at flirting with the bartenders. I always get so nervous when I
go to the bar. 
I should be going in a few minutes. I am just trying to finish my hair and 
get dressed, so if you are going to be late for the club, I will understand. 

I don't understand men. Why would you get married when you can't stay
faithful? I mean I have seen women cheat on their husbands and they act like
they are doing them some favor by letting them have sex with them. I guess
it is just because they don't have a good job that a guy would want to have
sex with them. Now, I have to be careful what I say because I don't know who
he is talking to right now.

I shouldn't be saying this because it is none of my business, but I don't
know why he married her. I mean he looks like he is still attractive. She is
such a bitch. I wouldn't take her if she paid me. I bet she is sleeping
around on him. I just feel sorry for her. 
I think I will take a quick shower before we go. I will be ready to leave in
5 minutes.

Tiffany's Phone

Hey, it's me. Did you think about what I said? I don't know what came over
me to call you like that. I guess I am going through the change. Anyways, I
had a really bad day at work and I can't focus on anything right now. I think
I am just going to have to go to bed early. I really hope you didn't have
anything important to do because I don't know how much more of this I can
take. I love you.

Tiffany's Phone

Hey, it's me. I am just calling to tell you that I love you. I know you 
don't want to hear that from me but I am sorry I couldn't say it before. I
know I need to work on my attitude and I will get it together as soon as
possible. I don't know what is wrong with me lately. I know I am not acting 
my best, but you just make me crazy sometimes. 

I was going to be in the city for a wedding last night and I wanted to get 
there early to spend some time with you. I guess I should have waited, but I
got pretty close and I didn't want to have a long drive there and then back 
home. I don't know if I will be able to see you tonight. I will try my best,
but I can't promise anything. 

I love you.

Tiffany's Phone

I know I said that I wasn't going to call you again, but this is an
emergency. I hope you don't think I am being stupid to call. I don't want to
make you feel uncomfortable by calling, but I just needed to let you know 
that I love you and I am going to do everything I can to win you back. 

I guess I need to just put all of this in writing. I don't know how long it
will take me to get there, but I am sure I will be there by Thursday
night. I want to do everything in my power to win you back. I just know it
will work out if I do everything the right way. 

Please don't get angry with me for calling, and please understand me 
completely. I love you with all of my heart. You mean everything to me. I am
hoping that you feel the same way about me. I really need you in my life. I 
can't do this without you. I am begging you to give me another chance. 
Tiffany, I can't live without you. I know that I can make you happy. 

Please just give me another chance. I am going to do everything I can to win
your heart back. I love you. I will see you Thursday night. 
I can't wait to hold you in my arms.

I hope that you feel the same way about me that I do about you. I know I
have said a lot of negative stuff about you, but I am truly a passionate
person and I want you to know the truth about me. I am begging you to give
me another chance. I need to get out of this funk that I am in</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:16
