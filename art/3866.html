Thank you for making these unique flower arrangements for our granddaughter’s bridal party luncheon! My flowers were a huge hit. The tables were filled with the most beautiful centerpieces and the table settings were all lovely. We got nothing but compliments from our bridesmaids and flower arrangements. Thank you again for everything!

Hi Diann,

My family was very impressed with your service. You are so sweet to work with! You came out a couple of weeks ago and helped me pick out the perfect flowers. I also had to re-arrange my patio furniture. Now it looks fabulous!

Our backyard has never looked better.

I am pleased to know that there is someone as enthusiastic, dedicated and committed as you are to your clients.

Thank you so much. We really appreciate the great work you did. It was a pleasure working with you!

Take care,

Mari O. – Laguna Niguel, CA

I wanted to thank you for the beautiful ceremony backdrop that you created for my wedding. I was amazed at the way the flowers bloomed in water! I didn’t see that in all the bridal magazines I’ve read. The pictures of your arrangements looked beautiful! I loved the overall look of the centerpieces you created. Thank you for keeping up with my design choices and taking my requests into consideration as well.

Thank you again so much for all of your time and effort!

Warm Regards,

I just wanted to let you know that the cake was fantastic! The buttercream frosting tasted amazing! It tasted exactly like a carrot cake. People were asking me what my cupcakes tasted like. So sweet!

Thanks so much for all of your help.
