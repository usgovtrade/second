Though many of us have already fallen in love with the O.G. beauty (and her Oscar-winning haircut), the decision to put a dark-skinned woman on the official, international face of the brand is both inspiring and a little perplexing.

As the beauty industry has come to expect, the new ad campaigns will feature Nyong’o in both her natural hair and her lightened strands. In the ad above, she is rocking darker locks but what about her many naturalist fans?

The problem? This isn’t “natural hair” or even lightening. It’s a wig. The question is: Why?

In an interview with L’Uomo Vogue, Lupita explained that she’s had curly hair since she was a child, but that it eventually became wavy. When it did, she said she did a video shoot for American magazine W and noticed that a majority of the models, as well as many of the celebrity images, featured “straight hair.”

I remember wondering, why don’t we see that on the cover of magazines? That [straight hair] isn’t representative of everyone… I was so intrigued and interested by this, that’s when I started pulling strands out to see what [my own hair] looked like.

In the past, wigs have been the norm. But in 2014, our society has become more comfortable with our own hair (even those with natural hair) and brands are finally catching on. We can now shop for real hair wigs on the runway as well as wear them during special occasions like graduation, weddings and awards shows.

And this is one of the reasons why I think the Lancôme ad campaign is important.

Even though the trend is being embraced slowly, slowly, it’s better to start now than risking alienating the naturalistas of the world. Who doesn’t want to follow the beautiful blonde? She’s lovely, she’s humble, she’s a wonderful actress, and she happens to be from America’s next-big-thing: natural hair.
