Kirito: O, sry, i am not from japan. this is a fighting style that im practicing. 
it is mostly used in boxing and some martial arts. if i can do it, i will take the kendou or nijinsha school test but im not going to a japanese school.

Yuki: Wow, that looks quite cool. but its looks like some kind of dance, right? 
it reminds me of... the flamenco that people were dancing yesterday.

Kirito: Uhh, can you explain what you are talking about? this was the first time i saw the flamenco. 
i dont really know. it looks like a dance, but its not right, is it?

Yuki: Well... 
im just watching them now. some people are dancing around

Kirito: You mean, people just start dancing like that in some place? 
it looks so weird!

Yuki: Yes. and usually its for fun, though, not like fighting or something.
but some people are so good that they can dance and fight at the same time,
but its hard to learn how to do that. 
it looks so fun to be dancing that hard and fighting and fighting and fighting,
like they are doing. its really hard to explain. you have to go see it yourself.

(t/n: 'they are doing' == 'yuki is dancing like that')

Kirito: ... Yup. i will see it with you. 
what is the place called? 
i was thinking about maybe going to a flamenco performance tonight. 
so i was thinking that maybe i can go there and watch you dance,
but i dont think there is any place like that in this city.

Yuki: 
oh, i can go with you. there is a place where im dancing 
at the end of the day. maybe you can see.

Kirito: Ah! cool!

Kirito: i am guessing it is close by?

Yuki: yes it is. 
it is just near here. the first one i saw was today.

Kirito: It sounds fun. i think i can see the first one. but its gonna be near here,
so we might be coming back here late at night. that s weird. 
i think its almost as bad as if i was going to a restaurant that stays open really late!

Yuki: It is okay, its not that late

Kirito: i see. (t/n: at the end of the chapter)

Yuki: Are you ready to go? 
it s raining... 
it s been raining for the whole day, but now its clearing up.

Kirito: Oh. so you are not coming?

Yuki: Oh, no, i can come, i just dont want to.

Kirito: Are you scared of the rain?

Yuki: No, i just want to be here by myself.

Kirito: You can come if you want to. 
i will wait here for you.

Yuki: What are you doing? 
you cannt go anywhere in the rain. it s dangerous. 
just wait in the house.

Kirito: What? 
in the house? 
why do we have to go to your house?

Yuki: For the rain, just stay inside until it is over, okay?

Kirito: Just, just stay in the house? i can just sit outside. 
you know, there is no harm in it. 
or maybe im wrong. 
its not like im going to sleep or something.

Yuki: i dont want you to come with me, ok?

Kirito: No. it s not that bad. 
i am not a kid or something, you know? 
...you dont trust me? 
i dont mean to intrude or anything like that.

Yuki: No, its not that! just... if you want to come, i am not telling you not to. 
its just that i cant stand rain. 
you never know, though, maybe the rain is good for my hair.

Kirito: Do you think so? 
maybe it is. i dont know. 
i have always wondered why people actually like it when they wear dresses. 
most people, i think, go out in shorts like this.

Yuki: no, no. im saying that for some girls, 
the rain will make their hair curl up and be wavy. 
it s also something that suits some guys. 
it doesnt suit me, though.

Kirito: Oh. i see. 
maybe we should go inside.

Yuki: Yes, we should go inside. 
please wait here for me.

Kirito: (t/n: 'please wait here for me')

Yuki: Ah, sorry, i think we should just go in now.

Kirito: Oh. 
okay.

(t/n: 'Kirito' sounds cool because of the way the 'yo' is read. it's not a name you hear often.)

___________________

yuki: i dont want you to get wet!

kirito: just a minute, i ll just get inside.

yuki: no, wait! come here, a minute, quickly.

kirito: im coming. 
i dont know why you are so surprised. 
maybe this isn ersed.

yuki: i didnt say anything.

kirito: you said it! you said that it is something that suits some guys. 
just to avoid the rain, right?

yuki: yes. 
i am sorry if i sound upset, but there is a place near here that ive never been to.

kirito: ah! so youre not just going to go in there anyway?

yuki: no, i wont go in, but ive never been there, so ive been thinking about going.

kirito: ah, yes.

yuki: if you are going to go, would you take me with you?

kirito: are you sure? 
your house isnt that far. 
if we take a taxi, it takes about five minutes.

yuki: no, i mean, i can go, but i think its better if you go with me. 
i might be bored by myself. 
we might get to talking to each other and stuff and then we are going to be late.

kirito: ah, you think so? 
i dont mind taking you. 
i think ive seen it. i mean, ive been inside with other people before.

yuki: ive never been there with anyone, only by myself. 
i think you should help me get in there. i dont want to go alone.

kirito: i see. 
so its not that you wont go by yourself?

yuki: no, not at all. i will be fine, but i dont want to go there alone.

kirito: i see. 
okay then. 
hey, are you still okay with that?

yuki: i think that ive got it all, dont i? 
i can do it by myself. 
please, just go now. i ll come back later.

kirito: i ll wait. 
you can just wait a little bit more. 
i ll come along with you, just for a little.

yuki: i need to go. 
you ll get soaked, so i ll wait outside.

kirito: okay. 
if you say so. 
i ll go get changed, then.

yuki: just go inside now. 
i will be waiting for you at the bottom.

kirito: ok. 
go ahead and go inside. 
if you want, we can go together.

yuki: okay, let s go.

kirito: im going in. 
i will see you in a little while.

(t/n: in the beginning of the manga, kirito is scared of a few ersed things. maybe he is referring to those.)

yuki: hey! come here! 
hey, take off your shirt.

kirito: you want me to change in front of you? 
sure i will. 
in the end, i will be wearing a t-shirt too.

yuki: no, right now.

kirito: ok. 
this is a little embarrassing, isn ight? 
hey, have you ever done this before?

yuki: no. 
do you think i am trying to be</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:09
