Instead 
of talking about our problems, everybody's problems, all the 
topics, and then, we just kept talking about us. We were supposed 
to talk about people's problems, and we just talked about us. So 
they asked us some questions, asked us to write some letters to 
friends that are dead. I got my letter done, and then we had to 
do some work at night. So we took the night off. The day after, 
we did some more work, and then we rested for a day, and then we 
took our work to the night. And then in three days, it was our 
time for the evaluation. After three days of hard work, we had to 
work in the night until the next night, and then the next night, 
and then, it was our turn again. I still remember the four words 
that I always had to tell in front of the committee: "My friends 
and I are very busy with our work," "we don't have time for 
play," "we're very hungry and thirsty," and my friend wrote for me, 
"I'm so tired and sleepy I don't know if I'm going to sleep or 
not." It took me an entire year for this trip. We did a very long 
time in China. As you know, I was teaching people how to sing, 
how to use computers. As my career is coming to a close, I got 
to learn more about computers and more about the way to work. I 
got a diploma, and it said in English, Chinese, and Spanish. It's 
going to be published all over China. And then they asked me, 
"when are you going to have a big concert?" I said, "What concert?" 
And they asked me, "Are you going to travel back to your home 
country?" And I said, "I'm not going back to my home country." 
I said, "I'm going to make a new home for all of us." So we're 
going to get married, and then we're going to travel to Central 
America. But we're not going to call it a family reunion anymore. 
We are going to call it a celebration of freedom. A big party to 
be free. And we're going to have concerts, singing, and dancing, 
and everybody is going to be singing and dancing together. So I 
still feel the need of people knowing that there is a big family 
in China, and I want to tell them the names of our family and 
call them by their first names. We'll call them by their first 
names. But China, my biggest problem is that you don't have a 
democratic voting system. You're not ready for democracy. You're 
very rich. But when you're very rich, you don't have a voice in 
the market. You don't have a voice in politics. So we want to 
start a movement to try and get China to adopt a democratic voting 
system. And also, you should have a democratic environment. If 
you're very rich, your environment should be to work for people, 
and it should be to work for all of the country's people. Not to 
enrich one family, the Zhang family. Not to help some corrupt 
politicians get more money. But you help all the people, and to 
make sure that everybody has a living wage. And the environment 
should be to have a democratic voting system. And it should be 
to help the poorest people to have better opportunities. And it 
should be to help the environment so the world can live in peace. 
The world should be able to live in peace. This is our biggest 
problem. It should be more to be peace, not more to be guns. This 
is China, and they have to give us guns, because they're very, 
very, very, very rich. They have enough guns for everybody. 
I'm already planning to be rich. If I can be successful, I'm 
going to be very rich. And I'm going to be very poor. That's how 
I feel now. And I'm just trying to raise money, because I have 
this big family that needs food, and clothes, and education. And 
I'm trying to raise the money to send the food and the clothes, 
and the education. And I'm going to pay them for my life for the 
entire world to know my freedom. 
ROBERT SCHNEIDER: Well, it's very amazing, to hear you speak 
about this. Just as I told you, I think I got my first exposure 
to the work of Professor Wu when I was a high school student 
many years ago. I found myself in a world where I was having 
difficulties, and one of the problems that I had was that I just 
didn't have any family. I had, fortunately, grown up in a pretty 
happy family. And I was in pretty good shape in high school. 
Some friends of mine from the class of 1977, which is a class that 
I graduated from my high school, were just like my best friends. 
It was just a class of twelve or thirteen of us that really 
liked each other a lot, and so we were able to stay in touch. And 
that just, as you were talking about, it just wasn't so much my 
problem as it was a problem of not having that support system 
that's so important when you're going into college, or whatever. 
So I just had to face some situations on my own, which, to me, 
is much more frightening than any difficulty I would have had if 
I'd had some family around. I mean, it was a pretty scary 
situation. 
But because of those class of '77, I really don't have any 
difficulty in talking to you now. But I do know that what you're 
talking about, that's really very important. It is the family, 
even if it's only one. It's the family that needs to be there for 
you. It's the family that sees you when you're not there. And 
it's the family that encourages you when you don't feel like 
doing what you're supposed to do. And you were so fortunate in</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:05
