The report will make recommendations for the next steps forward and establish a framework for gun safety and accountability.

“The NRA will offer to discuss any matter with any relevant state entity of an honest, respectful, and good-faith nature,” the NRA statement says. “But as the legislative debate progresses and rhetoric becomes more incendiary, NRA will defend the rights of hunters, gun owners, responsible dealers and sportsmen. The freedom to own a gun is a fundamental liberty.”

Rep. Jim Moran (D-VA), a member of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, offered his assessment of the debate from a far different perspective.

“If you think that the NRA has our best interests at heart and will fight for those interests in Congress, then I suggest that you not bother listening to their public comments this morning,” Moran told members of the press.

“They are against anything that makes life safer for victims of gun violence or for their loved ones.”
