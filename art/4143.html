Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) has been reported to inhibit the initiation and progression of cancers, but not all investigators have been able to confirm this. The current study was undertaken to investigate the expression and clinical significance of TFPI-2 in ovarian cancer. Our results show that TFPI-2 is expressed in ovarian cancer tissues, but not in normal ovarian tissues. The expression level of TFPI-2 is correlated with lymph node metastasis, degree of differentiation, stage of tumor and the response to chemotherapy, but not with age, FIGO stage and tumor size. Patients with high TFPI-2 expression had poorer survival, but multivariate analysis did not demonstrate a significant relationship between TFPI-2 expression and patient survival. TFPI-2 expression has the potential to be a useful biological indicator of tumor progression in patients with ovarian cancer. However, it may not be an independent prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:25
