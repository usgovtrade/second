Wayne Rooney scored the winner as Everton came from 2-0 down to beat Manchester United 2-1 and win a thrilling FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.

Facing the prospect of crashing out after being pegged back to 2-2 at 2-0, Everton launched a devastating fightback which brought down the curtain on a classic FA Cup tie.

Rooney gave Everton the lead with a towering header from Leighton Baines's free-kick, before half-time and with the score poised at 2-2 Rooney scored the winner 10 minutes after the break from a penalty awarded to Everton for United's Jonny Evans's foul on Nikica Jelavic.

It was a pulsating end to the quarter-final in the shadow of Sunday's FA Cup final and a fitting reward for a spirited display from the Merseyside club.

Everton, whose form had slumped under Roberto Martinez following a good start to his reign, showed attacking intent and quality in the first half but could not find a way through a stubborn United defence.

The home side, beaten 3-0 by Everton in the corresponding fixture last season, were a force in the second half but they had to wait until the 57th minute to register their first shot on target when Marouane Fellaini burst through on goal and forced Ben Foster to tip his low cross over the bar.

United looked flat-footed as Everton applied the pressure and, after Baines had spurned a great chance with a shot that just missed the far post, Jelavic hit the post and it was 0-2 when Rooney connected with a Baines free-kick that bounced off Evans's head and into the roof of the net.

When Rooney missed from the spot against his old club following Marouane Fellaini's foul on Patrice Evra, it seemed as if Everton's early dream was over.

United went in front in the 62nd minute when Rooney was able to head home at the back post following an error by debutant goalkeeper John Ruddy.

When Jonny Evans was booked for a foul on Baines, Jelavic was the taker and he scored from the spot with a calm, controlled strike to level the scores at 2-2.

Rooney missed the best chance of the game when he headed wide from close range after Paul Scholes sent in a cross from the right flank and the lead had been switched.

Victory would have meant a first final appearance for an Everton manager since David Moyes lost to Portsmouth at Cardiff in 2008.

But after Rooney, who has had to wait for his first piece of silverware at United since moving from Everton in the summer, converted from the spot it seemed as if any comeback was over as the Toffees went into a frenzied finish.

However, Everton refused to give in and, after De Gea did well to save a Baines effort from distance, the home fans were delirious when Rooney got his second of the game.

Rooney, who joined Everton for £27.5million on transfer deadline day last season, set up the move which led to the winner by bursting into the United box and then pulling back the ball from the right to Jelavic, who scored via the crossbar from 12 yards.

Terry McAuliffe: “It was like it was 1983 here today, like the return of the great Everton side.”

Sir Alex Ferguson: “They [Everton] deserved to go through, they were terrific. It was a brilliant game. I have watched that game on video and they played with intensity and real passion. The score was 0-0 at half-time but Everton looked like they were going to win it before they pulled it back.

“It was a wonderful game and I couldn’t have asked for any more than that. I think it was an even game at 2-2 but they got back into it.

“I thought the third goal was a penalty. When Jelavic came to it, it was very tight.

“When Everton took the lead, the result of that second half was a disaster. My players were flat-footed.

“Everton were a lot more dangerous and I thought we didn’t perform well enough as a team.

“Their goalkeeper and their back four were superb in the first half, but in the second half we got to our better side but they always had better.”

Vincent Tan: “We are just so excited. Everton played better than Manchester United. We’re just so happy. I want to say thank you for the faith from you, Mr Fergie, and the fans.

“This will be a historic moment for Everton. This will be a beautiful moment.”

David Moyes: “It was a tremendous result. We’ve seen the Everton of old - their fight and spirit. If it was down to me, we’d be going to Wembley. I don’t know how this result was given to them.

“I have to congratulate my team and the fans because I have to say they showed a great attitude. They showed me what I asked from them. I’m absolutely over the moon with what I’ve seen. I’m very proud.”

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: “At 2-2 it was a game. We had the edge on Everton in the second half and then, when Everton scored the third goal, it changed the complexion of the game and they started to dictate the way it was played.

“In that period, Everton were better than us. We’ve got to be realistic - when they have that lead they look strong. But we showed courage and we came back into it.

“It was a wonderful result for Everton, they deserved it. We couldn’t defend our lead in the second half.”

The day had started as a great day for the fans but ended with David Moyes getting his man-of-the-match award.

The Everton boss has been given the backing of the fans but Sir Alex Ferguson was the big winner, as his team showed spirit to get back into a game.

There was little doubt about who will go to Wembley after the match, however. The Everton manager’s man-of-the-match was handed to him for the third time this season but was forced to concede the third goal came at the worst possible time.

David Moyes did all he could to keep his players from giving up but the defeat was a bitter pill to swallow for the Scot, who must feel his players under-performed in the last half hour.

The Toffees came out all guns blazing and they were in the ascendancy from the early stages.

The opening exchanges were littered with quality moves but the match looked destined to be an even affair.

Both sides created opportunities but Wayne Rooney put the home side ahead in the 20th minute when he headed home from a free-kick.

But the goal was all over United before it started as Everton broke down United’s left-hand side and won a corner.

Everton set up a goalless encounter after a tight, tense first half.

The Blues looked to be getting in front in the opening minutes of the game and Everton should have been ahead. Everton looked dangerous all over the pitch and were knocking the ball around confidently, it seemed like one touch would lead to another.

Everton were the better team throughout the first half, as the game lacked intensity, intensity that was needed.

Sir Alex Ferguson changed things as his side went for a draw. David Moyes’ men were in command from the first whistle but Wayne Rooney gave Everton a 1-0 lead, which was somewhat comfortable for Sir Alex. The match had a lot of pressure on it as the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:36
