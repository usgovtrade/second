>You've already got a job...

Yeah, I know, I do have a few things going for me, including getting a 
promotion, but that kind of got buried in the stress of not being sure of 
what was going on.

Anyway, all is well, we have a great place, I have a really supportive 
family and friends, good job, all that stuff.  I really have to work on not 
letting it all get to me, but the truth is that I need to be busy, I need 
something to look forward to, and my time away from work has been a total 
loss so far.  If I have free time I lay in bed and try to go to sleep.  What 
the hell is that?

OK, I'm done.  I just needed to get that off my chest. No excuses, I am 
done.

So, are you really going to be in town this weekend? I was hoping we could 
get together. Did you not like the gift I sent? 
Let me know,

E

No, nothing particularly exciting. Just had a lot on my mind and it was
difficult to focus. It's better now, things are good. No more excuses. I
still have a lot to do, though.

So Monica, were you planning on a trip to Belize soon?

Hey Eb,
Just wanted to say that I think you are a great guy and that you don't have
to explain yourself to me. I was at the Houstonian last Saturday night
having dinner with a few friends. A guy seated next to me was staring at
me
the entire time. He was really creepy.? He must have been wondering
what's
wrong with me because I never strike up a conversation with a strange man
unless I have been drinking heavily.? I have a feeling I've never come off
as being very outgoing, so I thought about it for a moment and decided to
change my attitude.? I began to say, "hello" to him and ask him how he was
doing and when I would see him again.? I looked at you across the table
and
said to myself, "he's hot too", and I was out of there.? I don't know,
this
is the first time I let my guard down with any man since Dad died.? Sorry
to
bother you with my problems.

Monica

No worries, Monica.
It's very cool that you decided to come out of your shell a bit.? I was
really impressed with your new personality.? Sorry to hear things with
your Dad have not been so easy lately.? My thoughts are with you.? I'm
sure you would like to be surrounded by people to get some good old
fashioned Belizean "bunster-bump-bump" action.? It's a shame that my
trip
isn't until after that.? Anyway, you have fun in Houston.? Be sure to get
your name on the "I Dated a Married Man" Wall.

I am doing ok.? I just got out of the hospital the other day after a
minor
surgeries.? I'm not sure I will go back to the way I was before, but I
don't
want to start my life on this depressing note.? I miss Dad and hope to
get
over it.? The doctor seems to think that everything is in the past, but I
still find it hard to accept.? 

?? How about you?

Monica

Monica,

How are you doing? I bet you are happy that you got a little action for
your new boyfriend. Hope everything is going good for you.

Well, when you were in the hospital, I asked about Dad and the nurse
mentioned it was hard for him to say goodbye, but she did not explain
what she meant.? I can't wait to visit Belize, sounds like a lot of fun.?

I hope that you have a Happy Valentine's Day.? Are you dating anyone? How
is Dad? Sorry to hear about everything, hope it gets better for you.? Do
you think of me and Dad often?

Dad, I can't believe you are not doing well.?  I don't know why you have
been so sick since I moved out of the house.? You look great though.

Anyway, I hope you are feeling better, if not you can call mom and she can
talk to you.  Talk to you soon.

Eddy

See you when I am in town.
