"I am really sorry about the other night." "It's just because this is our first..." "Game seven." "I mean, we're both going for our first rings." "If you play like that again, you're gonna get yours." "Well, I think I will get it." "I think I should." "What do you mean?" "Is it true that in the Major Leagues that the umpires sit around naked, soaking wet?" "I heard it's true." "Why are they doing that?" "I have no idea." "It's something about a pine tar derivative that dries out the orifices." "Did you play in the Majors?" "No, I did not." "I had an uncle that did." "He was a pitcher for the Red Sox, and, uh, apparently, one time he walked in the umpires' locker room." "And he came across one of the umpires, naked." "Apparently, the umpire had showered, gotten out, and he was just drying off, and..." "He was completely naked?" "Well, apparently, he was." "I gotta tell you, it just goes to show you that baseball is not all about the money." "So, that's something new for me, all right?" "Okay." "Hey, baby, don't you worry" "I'm gonna make it all right" "Hey, hey, baby, don't you worry" "I'm gonna make it all right" "Hey, hey, baby, don't you worry" "I'm gonna make it all right" "How you doing?" "I'm doing good." "How are you?" "Well, this is something we can build upon." "You know, you and I can make this thing go a long way." "I'm not gonna come in there and pull any surprises on you." "I'd never do that." "I'd never do that." "All right." "Good to hear." "So, we've kind of come full circle, haven't we?" "I was very fortunate to watch you when you were younger." "And now you're gonna watch me mature and become the man that I always knew I was gonna become." "Well, hey, I've got a lot better stories than this one." "Yeah, you do, huh?" "Yeah." "Good." "All right." "Good night, sir." "Good night, Todd." "You're still a better cook than you think you are." "I love you, mom." "I love you, too, honey." "Are you going to sleep?" "No." "I'm gonna go watch some TV." "Okay." "I'll be in in a little while." "Okay." "Good night, baby." "Night." "And that's the game!" "The Boston Red Sox are World Series champions." "Big celebration at the Boathouse, starting soon." "Hey, can I steal a beer?" "Thanks." "I'd like to offer the following toast." "Well, a toast would imply that we won the game, and I thought that was a pretty safe bet at the beginning of the game." "My mother once told me a story about a great hero, and that's why today's so damn special, because on this day, we're not only celebrating that we're all alive and kicking, but we're also celebrating every mother" "and father and son and daughter, because whether they knew it or not, they were all just like Todd from Baltimore." "This city was built on struggle." "And here's to struggle being over, and the best of us not only surviving, but thriving!" "Here's to you!" "But I wanted to mention a few of the people I think we ought to thank here." "I was lucky enough to have played baseball at the University of Arizona, and I had my scholarships and all the money I could use, but there was one man who really helped me out." "And that man's name was Harry Volberding, and he is a very special man." "To Harry." "Congratulations, honey." "Thanks." "And, lastly, we gotta thank all of you." "You know, when we won that first game, there was so many people out there cheering us on," "I..." "I couldn't hear myself think for all the noise." "But I know I couldn't have done it without all of you, so..." "So thank you very much." "Hey, what are you doing?" "You're not allowed down here!" "What?" "No, I wasn't doing anything." "I just came down here to have a good time like everybody else." "Yeah, well, you've got to go home, kid." "That's it." "Come on." "Go on." "No, no, no." "I'm gonna stay." "You can't go home." "Come on, go back to your party." "Come on, go back to your party." "Hey." "It's not my party." "I didn't throw it." "Let him stay." "I can't." "I didn't throw the party." "I just crashed it." "He was gonna go." "I told him he could stay." "I think we should go celebrate." "Come on." "Let's go." "Come on." "I think I got one last toast in me." "You wanna hear it?" "Sure." "Okay." "To you guys." "To all of you who have been down here from the beginning with us, from the Minor Leagues, you know?" "You've been living with the dream long before we got here." "And to all of us, who have been down here with you, from the Minor Leagues to the Majors." "Because, hell, this is the best team I've ever seen." "We won it all." "Let's go, go, go!" "He's going, boys!" "He's going!" "Hey." "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa." "What are you doing?" "You said go." "You said that he was leaving." "Oh." "But he was never leaving." "He was gonna go, then I told him he could stay." "Well, now he's gonna stay." "No, I mean..." "I don't think he's gonna be able to play anymore." "Do you?" "Yes, I do." "I know it's not ideal, but it's all we got right now." "I'm going to head back to the hotel and get some sleep." "All right." "Wake me when you get back." "Okay." "What the hell happened to him?" "What do you mean what happened to him?" "Hey!" "What happened?" "We had a big night." "Huh?" "I got laid!" "I'm in." "Let's go to the bar." "Hey!" "Hey, that's not funny." "Hey!" "You're mean!" "This is so awesome." "Oh!" "Now that was a team victory." "Oh." "Hey, you just lost your membership card to the Majors, mister." "You lost your card, pal." "Yeah." "How do you like them apples?" "How do you like them apples?" "Oh, you wanna go?" "You wanna go?" "All right, we'll go." "We'll go." "Do you like it rough?" "I know what I'm doing." "I know what I'm doing." "What are you doing?" "All right." "What are you doing?" "He ain't going nowhere." "I know exactly what I'm doing." "You don't do that to me, you prick!" "Oh, you don't do that to me!" "Get him!" "Stop!" "Stop!" "That's enough!" "That's enough!" "Stop it!" "That's enough!" "Hey, hey, hey, hey!" "You all right?" "Leave me alone." "Hey, take care of the couch." "It's a mess." "We just won the World Series." "Hey, we won, we won!" "We won." "We won, we won, we won!" "Holy shit." "The Red Sox are going to the World Series." "All right, all right." "The reds are going to the Series." "I need a drink." "I know I need a drink." "Oh, shit." "God damn it." "Well, hey, look, we won!" "Hey, Tommy!" "It's the Yankees!" "It's the Yankees!" "Hey, fellas!" "It's Buckner!" "Buckner!" "Buckner!" "Hey, Buckner, you dumb shit!" "Hey, Todd, I need you to do me a favor." "I need you to promise me to keep your mouth shut until this whole thing blows over, okay?" "No." "Yes." "No." "Why?" "Because I'm gonna tell everybody that you guys bet the game." "It's not true." "Well, that's not gonna be true until you say it, so I need you to keep your mouth shut, okay?" "No, it's not true." "I got enough shit to deal with." "You're lying right now." "I'm not lying right now." "I'm not lying right now." "You gotta believe me." "It's true, Tommy."
