upgrade, all of your current team information should

might have created, so feel free to make yourself at

The purpose of this message is to update you on the 
status of your Business Unit's membership in Enron 
Corp.  This type of e-mail has been sent to you since 
November, before we changed our administration systems 
in December.  At that time, we announced that all Enron 
companies would receive a new login id and password for 
the Enron Corp. Membership Extranet (see original 
message below).  When logging in, the name of your 
company would have been part of your password.  Most 
users found this to be too cumbersome and only one 
password was entered each time. As a result, most 
people stopped using the Extranet.

Since our new system was installed, we have discovered 
that not everyone received a login ID and password in 
the mail. Also, a few people have had their Extranet 
IDs expire. If you have recently logged in to the 
Enron Corp. site using your old ID/password, please 
change it by going to the Members section of the 
Extranet (<http://ecthou-webcl1.corp.enron.com/extranet/>) 
and choosing "Forgot Username or Password?" Click the 
'Forgot Username or Password?' link and the system 
should bring up a page where you'll enter your User ID 
and password.

If you have forgotten both your User ID and 
Password, please call the ISC Customer Care Center at 
713-345-4727 and select option 2.


As always, if you have questions about your login or 
password, please call the ISC Customer Care Center at 
713-345-4727. Thank you for choosing to be a part of 
Enron Corp.

Subject:  Update your records -- new login IDs and passwords

As we discussed, your new login IDs and passwords are effective 
immediately.  If you were a user outside of the Houston area, your 
user ID and password are now your Houston login ID and password. 
You do not need to call anyone to effect this change. 

Should you have any questions or experience any problems, please 
feel free to contact the ISC Call Center at 713-345-4727. 

Thank you for your participation in the Enron/Dynegy Competition. 

We look forward to the opportunity to work with you. 

Sincerely, 

Ken Lay, Chairman & CEO

P.S. Please send me your phone number and location for reference.
