"My leg fell off." "It fell off?" "But you're dancing." "I was dancing and it fell off." "If they find it in the middle of the square, they'll throw it away, won't they?" "You'll never believe this, but when I was dancing," "I wanted to call you." "But something was stopping me." "I have no experience with this sort of thing, and it's your job." "But if you see me tomorrow, tell me what I should do." "So we left?" "Are you happy?" "With what we did." "Yes, why not?" "I can't explain." "I can." "Because I wasn't at the top of my form today." "A few of those songs were for you." "And all the rest were for me." "So you were thinking of me?" "At the beginning and at the end." "How about in the middle?" "It didn't occur to me to look." "But I am thinking of you." "Do you know what time it is?" "I don't care." "It doesn't matter." "There's always time for what is important." "For us." "To love one another." "Loving... is important." "For me, the rest is just small talk." "I'm going to sleep." "Me too." "Can you hear it?" "What?" "My heartbeat." "Do you know the sound?" "Yes." "When you close your eyes and listen hard, it's there." "It's like something living, wanting to live." "Listen." "Can you hear it?" "Yes." "What?" "Like something living." "Listen." "Stop." "Can you hear it?" "Yes." "Loving is important." "Stop." "Now you're not listening to me." "Yes, I am." "I want to go back with him." "There is no "him" anymore." "Do you understand?" "Yes." "I'm going." "Do you love me?" "I don't know." "Maybe." "Go to sleep." "Where is the princess?" "We were worried about her." "She couldn't wait." "She's dancing." "Too early." "We've got the money." "The show is now over." "And with a bravo, I close this beautiful show." "Don't you recognize me?" "You never see anybody." "And I don't care what happened." "What do you want?" "Did you recognize me?" "They said I could see you." "They said it was your birthday." "Happy birthday." "How is it going?" "Fine." "And you?" "Is everything all right?" "Not really." "There's no show today, and they say I owe them some money." "What do you think about it?" "There's no show and they say I owe them some money." "What do you think about that?" "As if you were mine." "A present for your birthday." "There's no present." "It's me, your father." "I love you." "I love you." "Let's go." "Let me." "I'll take you." "Wait." "Where are we going?" "You'll see." "I can't leave yet." "You're staying?" "I'm coming back." "You didn't think I was coming back." "Did you want to see me again?" "Now?" "It's all over, I suppose." "I was waiting for you." "I thought you would be coming back." "And if I hadn't found you again, it would've been for you to come find me." "The day you left the house, you asked me, "Did I love you?"" "Now you know." "I will always love you." "The princess has a surprise for you." "Surprise?" "Follow me." "Where is he?" "Are you still angry at him?" "I'm sure he's sorry." "It doesn't matter anymore." "The important thing now is that he should be here for your birthday." "You shouldn't be here either." "What if someone saw you?" "And you know he's not going to come." "The important thing is that I'm here." "Then let's go somewhere else." "You can't see him." "Is he with you?" "I'm sure he is." "Stay there." "Don't make a noise." "Now?" "Go back inside." "Go." "Go back inside." "Go back inside." "I never saw him again." "I never knew why." "I was looking for him, but then he disappeared." "And he has never returned since." "Happy birthday." "What is it?" "I'll leave." "Wait." "If you can see me now, you've forgotten your past." "And for me, you don't exist." "But you can never forget me." "Is it true?" "I'm sorry, but my time here is over." "I leave you my memories, something to remember me by." "May I have the honor of accompanying you to the gate?" "I have no one else to thank for this present." "Leave it, leave it, do it for me, please." "I don't know you, but I know myself." "I know I'm going to love you." "I love you." "I love you." "I love you." "I love you." "I love you." "I love you." "What are you doing?" "A gift to your sister." "You have to help me." "Help you?" "How?" "There's only one way." "What way?" "To escape." "Tell me what happened." "Where are you now?" "In the cellar." "In a pit." "But I don't know." "I'm..." "I'm exhausted." "Did you talk with the boys?" "Do you want us to come?" "You can't leave." "Why not?" "Not yet." "You know them." "You have to stay." "You don't understand." "They could find you." "Are you going to stay?" "You must stay." "I want to stay." "I have to." "My child, I have one favor to ask." "Don't hurt them." "We'll try to avoid it." "Please, give them back their teddy bears." "It's not that bad." "I can't bear to see it." "I've got to go." "Don't do it." "Stay." "I have to go." "Do it for me." "Don't look." "My dear sister." "Do you want this?" "My parents are here." "Don't say anything." "Don't say anything." "Hello." "Hello." "The door." "Wait." "I don't like the window." "Why not?" "You should shut it." "What are you doing?" "Nothing." "Why?" "I have a headache." "Open your eyes." "Do it for me." "Why?" "For your parents." "Don't close them." "What are you doing?" "They say it helps." "Let me." "I don't have the courage to hurt them." "So you're still going to do it?" "When you're ready." "And you?" "Will you leave them all alone?" "We'll be back soon." "I'd like to stay here for a while, if you don't mind." "Of course not." "I'd like to stay, too." "I have nothing to keep me here anymore." "Wait." "Let's give her some time." "They must find out sooner or later." "I don't think she'll stay." "Why?" "She doesn't love me." "But you said..." "I know." "But love can be found anew." "You know about that." "I don't know what I know anymore." "This was the way I found back to you." "It's not a coincidence." "I can't leave them now." "I could leave them anytime, because there's always a chance they won't find me." "But I don't know where I would go." "And that's the problem." "It's all the same." "I'll stay until she comes back." "But you..." "If you want to leave..." "Why?" "Is there a reason?" "If you feel you must, don't worry about us." "The money is in the account, in an account you name." "Don't expect us to ever return." "Good evening." "Good evening." "Good evening." "Good evening." "What's this about?" "I'm taking him." "He has the flu." "I'm worried about him." "Please give him to me." "If you say so." "You have no right." "What am I supposed to do with him?" "I don't know." "What am I supposed to do with him?" "What am I supposed to do with him?" "The princess will take him." "The princess?" "Where?" "Can I come with you?" "With pleasure." "I'll help you." "What am I doing?" "We can talk." "Where are you taking me?" "I don't know." "What am I doing here?" "Stop asking so many questions." "I'm hungry." "</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:08
