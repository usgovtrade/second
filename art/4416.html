More particularly, the present invention relates to systems, methods and devices for managing fluid delivery systems having a fluid source and a controller to manage the fluid delivery system.
Medical treatments often involve infusing fluids into a patient. One common example is the administration of medical fluid to control bed wetting, often in the form of an antisepsis treatment. Such a treatment is often performed by introducing a catheter to the bladder of a patient to allow an external fluid supply source to be coupled to the patient via the catheter and bladder. For example, to bathe or wash an indwelling catheter used during hemodialysis, medical fluids are continuously introduced to a catheter, while the catheter is inserted in the patient""s vein so that the medical fluid overflows into the patient""s vein from the catheter.
An exemplary system for the administration of medical fluids is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,666,437. This patent discloses an apparatus that includes a bladder that is fitted onto a catheter and connected to a supply of fluid under pressure. The bladder is inflatable with the fluid from the supply to maintain the catheter in a fixed disposition in the patient""s body. The bladder may include a self-sealing perforated elastomeric endcap that prevents escape of fluid from the bladder. The endcap can also be removed to increase the capacity of the bladder. Another bladder-type urine collector is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,500. A self-adjusting catheter clamp is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,272,733. The apparatus includes a urine drainage bag having an opening sealed by a slit septum. Urine passes through the septum into a drainage bag. A catheter having a valve thereon is attached to the bag, and when the septum is ruptured, urine in the bag drains into the catheter via the valve.
There is a continuing need for medical devices and methods to safely deliver fluids to patients. There is also a continuing need for medical devices and methods that allow for the infusion of medical fluids.
There also exists a need for a mechanism that allows for the use of a conventional infusion pump to infuse medical fluids at a low delivery rate.
There also exists a need for improved systems and methods of delivering drugs, pharmaceuticals, or other fluids to achieve more controlled and uniform concentrations.
The present invention solves the needs set forth above. In addition, the present invention provides other advantages over the prior art. The present invention provides a disposable fluid delivery system that allows the use of an internal tubing or fluid path in combination with a fluid flow source to deliver medical fluids to a patient. The system also allows the efficient delivery of medications, such as drugs, pharmaceuticals, and vaccines.
In one embodiment of the present invention, a system includes an infusion pump adapted to supply a fluid to an infuse site at a predetermined rate and a delivery device in fluid communication with the infusion pump. The delivery device is adapted to deliver a fluid from the infusion pump to the patient at a rate that is variable from zero to the predetermined rate. In an exemplary embodiment, the delivery device includes a medical fluid bladder which may have a variable capacity, a delivery port coupled to the bladder, and an elastomeric septum coupled to the bladder and covering the delivery port. When a fluid is supplied from the infusion pump to the bladder through an internal flow path of the bladder, the bladder can expand to allow a maximum fill of the fluid. The fluid in the bladder can then be delivered through the delivery port as the fluid expands in the bladder through the elastomeric septum. If fluid is not supplied by the infusion pump to the bladder, fluid that may remain in the bladder will exit through the septum back into the infusion pump, thereby preventing fluid from being wasted by leaving a portion of the fluid in the bladder when the bladder is not filled with fluid. The variable capacity of the bladder allows the user to control how much of the fluid will be delivered to the patient, thereby reducing waste of the fluid.
The present invention also provides other advantages over the prior art. For example, the present invention allows for the variable rate fluid delivery using an infusion pump. In addition, the present invention also allows for a simple mechanism for introducing additives or medications to the medical fluid as it is being delivered to a patient.
These and other advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, drawings, and claims.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:18
