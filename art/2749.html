Our top recommendation is the Disney Babies Night Light, designed specifically for Disney lovers. This product is not only the cutest, safest, most cost-effective, and longest lasting but it’s also an incredibly useful item for young kids. We received the Disney Babies night light to test out and were blown away by the quality, the price, the safety features and ease of use. The only thing that is better than a Disney Babies night light is Disney Babies BEDA light.

We recently created a guide to everything you need in your child’s room, which will be sure to help any parent get started on their child’s room transformation. The guide offers advice and resources for kids’ room decor, bedding, decor, wall decor and more, from the smallest newborn to pre-teen girls and boys.

We’ve just returned from our biggest Disney trip yet with our oldest son. While planning this trip, we decided to focus this latest trip around the Walt Disney World® Resort.

The Walt Disney World® Resort has so much to offer! You can choose to spend a weekend at one of the Disney Theme Parks (there are four!) and then stay at the resort for a relaxing retreat. You can also go during school breaks or the week leading up to Spring Break and have the most fun possible. Below are a few reasons why we are obsessed with the Walt Disney World® Resort.

Magic Kingdom Park – Your kids will love the rides (and we mean ALL of the rides). Each of the four theme parks has their own unique set of unique rides (and their own unique, original theme). Our favorite is the Mine Train Thru Nature’s Wonderland.

Epcot Center – Your kids will love Epcot Center. With Epcot Center being in the middle of the Walt Disney World® Resort, you can experience the entire world in one park. We love seeing all the countries that Walt Disney envisioned while he was working on Walt Disney World®. If you stay on-property at a Disney-owned resort, you can use the Disney Transportation System to get around Epcot Center and other attractions in the Disney-owned resorts.

Mulan – Your kids will love Mulan. This is one of Disney’s oldest classics and is a movie that every child should have to watch at least once. Also, we cannot tell you enough that you should make it a point to eat at the Garden Grill while staying at a Disney resort. We usually get a Disney platter, but you can get the same thing for yourself. You’re not really a Disney Platter person without it.

Animal Kingdom Park – You and your children will find magic in the Animal Kingdom Park. There are no characters, no princesses and no lines – just so much fun for your kids! The animals are close enough to touch but still quite far away, making it perfect for adults and kids to experience. Our favorite ride is Kali River Rapids, an awesome whitewater adventure that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

Pools – If you’re looking for fun and entertainment outside of the parks, the pool at your Disney-owned resort is the perfect way to find both. Your kids can splash, splash, splash with friends and learn how to play water games like Marco’s Polo or King of the Mountain. It’s not even about the pool, but the atmosphere that your kids get from the resort’s pool. The Walt Disney World® Resort is magical at any time of the year, but pool time is extra magical!

Dining – The Walt Disney World® Resort has five distinct types of dining, and you and your family will get to experience them all. You’ll find an Italian restaurant at your Walt Disney World® Resort, but they’re all Disney’s Italian restaurants are top of the line! The Grand Floridian Resort’s Todd English’s – Prego Italian Restaurant offers incredible Italian cuisine in a lovely indoor/outdoor dining room. The Polynesian Resort’s ‘Ohana is another amazing dining experience that you and your family will not want to miss out on. If you’re a gourmet foodie, try the exquisite dining at the ‘Ohana because it’s a gourmet dining experience at its finest.

Shopping – The Walt Disney World® Resort also has shopping that you and your kids can enjoy. There are three options: The Disney-owned resort, Downtown Disney® and the new West Side.

The Disney-owned resorts offer incredible shopping experiences. The Marketplace at the Polynesian Village Resort, for example, is filled with Disney themed gifts, collectibles and souvenirs that you and your family will want to pick up as a memento of your trip. Westside and Downtown Disney also offer shoppers their own unique offerings as well, making it easier to shop around and find items that you and your family will love.

Restaurants – With a variety of dining options to choose from, you will be able to eat in a different restaurant every night of your trip. With restaurants throughout the Walt Disney World® Resort, you have the choice of where to dine and which location you and your family will want to eat at the most. You’re never going to see these restaurants again, so take a trip back to the restaurants you and your family enjoyed the most.

Pools – When staying on-property, there are pools at each of the four theme parks, which allows you and your family to try more of them and try something different every day.

The Disney World® Resort is a great place to vacation. It is the happiest place on Earth for most people, and what could be better than spending your vacation at one of the happiest places on Earth? Your kids will love the rides, pools, shopping, restaurants, magic and atmosphere of the Walt Disney World® Resort. Disney is one of the best ways to spend time with your kids during the school break.

Here are some things you should consider if you are considering staying on property at a Disney resort.

Hotels – As we mentioned, there are four theme parks that are all connected to each other. You will want to stay on-property at one of the Disney-owned resorts (these resorts are within walking distance to the parks). The other option is to stay off-property at one of the six Walt Disney World® Resorts (Disney’s Art of Animation is the exception – it is an on-property resort but is not directly connected to the Disney-owned resorts). Either way, Disney has a plethora of accommodations to choose from.

Park – Disney World® Resort is a magical place with four theme parks – Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center, Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. Your child will love the rides and characters that can be found throughout the theme parks.

Water Parks – There are also water parks that are connected to the theme parks (including Epcot Center and Disney’s Hollywood Studios), so you and your kids can spend some time at the water parks while you’re in the theme parks.

Dining – Epcot Center is home to the fantastic IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth. This fireworks show is one of the best in Disney and also a great family activity! The best part? You will not wait in a long line to watch the show (in our opinion, at least).

Shopping – This is a place where every kid wants to go to the Disney World® Resort. This is the place to go and find all kinds of unique and original items that you would not find anywhere else. There are a number of shopping opportunities within the resort, as well as outside of the resort. Whether it’s shopping for a Disney birthday or just shopping for your family (and possibly yourself), there is something for every member of your family to enjoy!

In the Orlando area, there are two great spots to go and just chill: downtown Disney (which is a great place to stay after you’re done with your trip) and the waterpark resorts.

There are a lot of different options for you to choose from when it comes to staying on-property at the Walt Disney World® Resort. If you are looking for somewhere to stay, you might want to start by deciding whether you want to stay on-property (with a hotel at a Disney-owned resort or an off-property hotel) or whether you want to stay off-property (with a hotel at a non-Disney owned resort).

A quick google search for “best kid’s toy” will provide you with a list of the top products in each category. So let’s take a quick look at the top kid’s toy of 2014.

If you’ve ever looked into buying a doll for your child, the options can be pretty overwhelming. If you think about it, there are not very many dolls that are just for</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:59
