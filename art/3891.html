“He’s got a huge presence in the ring, a huge presence outside the ring and he’s still got the same swagger. He’s going to be exciting to watch.”

Cazares, who turns 36 this month, has plenty of incentive for a fight against Rodriguez.

He came out of nowhere in 2006 to win the Ring junior featherweight title with a decision over then-welterweight titlist Fernando Vargas in what became one of the great upsets of modern time.

Cazares lost the title in his first defense, but has never looked back.

The 34-year-old Rodriguez has been inactive since his second loss to then-bantamweight titlist Jorge Arce on Aug. 23, 2009.

However, Rodriguez has been working on his skills, as well as sharpening up his game plan and is confident of his chances in the rematch with Cazares.

“It’s going to be a very good fight,” Rodriguez said. “We were there the first time, we fought a war the second time and now we’re back in the ring again.

“I don’t like to call myself the best because I can be beaten at any given moment, but I do believe I’m the best 154-pounder.”

“I was out of the ring for a long time, but not a long time in my mind. I knew that as soon as I got back I was going to fight again.”

In the meantime, Rodriguez has been training with his younger brother, former featherweight titlist Juan Manuel.

And the elder Rodriguez said he has kept busy on the road, but he said he’s ready to make a big splash in the welterweight division.

“I’ve been training and working hard at my preparation and staying in shape and everything,” Rodriguez said. “But I just got back from Australia and I’m training a little bit more there, so I think that’s going to take the edge off and keep me in good shape.

“I have one more fight to go for the WBO, one more fight to become a four-division world champion. This is going to take some pressure off. I’ve been working a lot on the mental part of my fighting, and I think this is going to be the last of the three fights. If I get by Cazares, I’m going to get into that title chase.”

Should he make it to welterweight, Rodriguez said he wants to fight for a world title in his new division.

If not, then he wants to face some of his old foes in a sort of farewell tour in Mexico.

“If not, I’m going to go over to Mexico,” Rodriguez said. “I’ve got a lot of money with the PPV numbers (they did over there). That would be a nice way to go out. I don’t know what I’m going to do if I don’t get that title, but it’s not good to be undefeated forever.”

In the meantime, Cazares will be back in action, this time against Chidi Njokuani in the main event of a Tecate card at the StubHub Center on May 10.

But, Cazares is far from done.

He has his sights set on bigger fights, and if Rodriguez doesn’t work out he’ll soon find his way back to the ring.

“No matter who he fights or what he says, or what he does,” Cazares said, “I’m a better fighter. He’s a very good fighter, but I still think I’m a better fighter. So we’ll see what happens.”

He has made some big improvements. He had his issues with Juan Manuel but he has a good work ethic. He is also trying to do more with his stand up and he might surprise with a better stand up game in the future…</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:38
