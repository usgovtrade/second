going to do something like that." 

"Mom, if that comes out of your mouth you have definitely lost the 
father-daughter privilege to say anything to me." Tiff replied, then 
added "Maybe I should reconsider my life choices, but I don't think 
there is much I can do about it now. By the time the results come in I 
won't be speaking to you, I can guarantee you that. So, how long have 
you been a spy?" 
"I am not a spy, I am a reporter. Anyway, I thought you would want to 
know about this. I heard it from Rick, he told me he got it from a 
source." Trudy informed. "I am glad to hear he is still alive, so he is 
fighting the government that is trying to kill us. That's so cool. You 
want to know something more funny?" Tiff asked. "What?" Tiff replied. 
"I saw the first lady speaking to John today. He looked really scared. I 
think you might have had an effect on him." Trudy said as she rolled 
her eyes.  
"Oh, mom, don't be silly, I am just a secretary. He doesn't really know 
me and has never even been to my home. So how can you be so sure?" Tiff 
asked, trying to get back on the subject. "I have my sources." Trudy 
stated. "That's not a good sign. What if she is making him have strange 
feelings."  
"You don't know what you are talking about. I was your age once and 
remember how it felt and what your body went through when you were 
having strange feelings. Trust me, I am all for John choosing who he 
wants to be with, I just don't think he is ready for anything like that 
right now. He needs time to settle down from this business with the 
government." Trudy stated. "Why is he so important to me anyway? I don't 
know him. I mean I have been in his office on a few occasions, but I 
don't even know his name. He didn't even introduce himself when I met 
him for the first time. Are you sure you have the right information?" 
Tiff replied. "As a matter of fact, I saw him speaking to your dad the 
other day. Remember, he is your dad. I don't understand it either, but 
Tiff, you have seen me and your dad talking on numerous occasions, so 
you know that it is true." Trudy explained. "Whatever," Tiff said as she 
got up to head to her room. "I don't want to argue with you, it is not 
going to help anything. Plus, I am beat, so I am going to go sleep. If 
you want to keep your job around here, you better get some rest, too." 
Trudy replied and then left Tiff in her room. As she sat down on her 
bed, she began to cry. "Mom is going to fire me, then I will never get 
another job, I will lose my apartment, and then where will I go?" Tiff 
asked herself as she sobbed. "I wonder if John likes me. He is very nice 
and a perfect gentleman. I wonder if I do to him what he has done to me. 
I am not sure what he has done to me, but his eyes are magical and I 
loved the touch of his hands. I wonder if it will be like when I met 
Tucker. I wonder if Tucker is like John? I don't have anybody anymore 
and I am stuck in this room. I wonder if this is how Tiffany feels, too?" 
Tiff asked herself as she realized where her thoughts were going. It was 
silly to think that John could ever be like Tucker. Well, if he was, 
maybe I can change him. But if he is not, this will be one time I never 
get to try it out. I have got to get out of here.
