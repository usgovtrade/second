He also performed in London as well as with the Keith Trio, who were to be heard at the Catskills for twenty-seven seasons.

While in the army he sang in the army’s official theatre company and was a member of the military chorus. He was also a performer at Camp Kilmer for five years.

Theatre engagements 
Between 1930 and 1947 he was a member of the New York Repertory Company, starring in “The Women” “Ruddigore” and “The King’s Fool” among other plays. He also performed in “The New Moon”, in “The King’s Fool” and “Mr. and Mrs. North”, all at the Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. He starred in “Petrouchka” at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1936.

“Punch and Judy” was the last of his shows in which he was to be seen, opening at the Lyric Theatre in the Bronx on October 3, 1951. “In a little over a year the show has taken shape, grown a little and found itself – with a very little help from me. I have come to know it well, but have had little to do with it.” These words were his final to the audience.

The show's star, Joseph Calleia, died shortly before the show was to open, as did the composer, Fred L. Tuten, who had written the music and lyrics to the show.

As an actor Mr. Calleia had roles in many Broadway musicals, including “The Firefly,” “Ziegfeld Follies” and “High Button Shoes.”

Later life 
After the show opened on Broadway, Charles J. Harper, the music director for the Broadway show, got a job with another musical company and left. Calleia also suffered financial hardship. “One way or another it appears that I shall have to go on for awhile with the only remaining cast member in the show, which has no producer nor director as yet.” By early 1951 Calleia was back playing Punch at the Little Theater, East 26th Street, New York. The show ran for another two seasons, with Paul Chaverin as the show’s star.

Calleia returned to the Lyric Theatre on October 4, 1951 where he starred in “Punch and Judy” for its final shows. He did appear with the shows’ new producer at a benefit for the Actors Fund, which was held at the Lyric Theatre on September 25, 1952.

Calleia died on July 29, 1955 in his home in Mount Kisco, New York. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Muffy, and their two daughters, Martha and Rosemary.
