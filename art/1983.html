A Note from the Author

Included in the collection are a number of previously published holiday stories that all feature the Thayers, Nancy's daughters Kate, Jane, and Meg, and their little dog Missy (in three previous books and in another in progress).

The stories here are intended to take you back to a certain time and place—a time and place when the Christmas season is in full swing, before the arrival of the new baby, and when the girls have yet to enter their senior years and must learn to negotiate the world of adulthood.

For anyone who has ever been a child in a family with a parent who is a writer, who has a sibling or cousins or friends who are writers, this collection has something to offer you. Because there are siblings, sisters, cousins, and friends who have or are becoming writers. And they face the same challenges as you. So let the stories in this book become just as familiar as the stories you told your siblings, your cousins, and your friends. Because sometimes we just need to hear the same old stories in a new way, and this collection will offer you just that.

A Little Bit of Home

It was a cool, gray evening in autumn, but the air held the promise of winter to come. Meg, standing outside the door to her family's large Victorian house, hugged herself as if she could keep herself warm simply by that gesture. Inside, the living room was bright with lights and buzzing with activity. There was no place she'd rather be than home with her family, but it was late, and she felt a vague sense of unease about being out after dark. It would be so much better to be tucked in bed in her old room with the stuffed animals and the special storybook she liked to read every night before sleep. Or lying on the couch, with Missy cuddled close, reading Nancy Drew mysteries.

Meg sighed as she thought of what awaited her in the house: cookies, coffee, talking, and lots of help with homework. Her mother would be in the kitchen, making sure she had everything she needed. When her father returned from work, they'd eat supper together, while her grandmother watched TV in the den. Meg wanted to hug all the generations of her family, but in the end she'd be left alone.

Maybe that was what she missed—to know there were people waiting for her, who knew how to treat her special. Maybe that's why she loved being around her little brother and sister. Even if Meg was usually the one giving the hugs, and the one doing the sharing.

Meg was looking down at the sidewalk when her father called from the car. "Meg?" he called again. "You comin' or not?"

She shook herself and turned, heading toward the car where the chilly November air felt almost arctic. The car door opened as she approached. "Sorry I took so long, Dad. I was . . ."

But what? She'd been sitting on the curb, hugging herself and feeling sorry for herself. The truth was, she'd been standing at the corner for a couple of minutes, just waiting for him to call out, hoping he'd be able to wait for her. But he hadn't, so here she was.

"You were what?" her father asked.

Meg's smile spread. "I was just thinking. That's all."

He nodded, not convinced that was all she'd been doing, but clearly not about to argue. He just looked at her with that loving, knowing gaze, and smiled back. Then his eyes moved beyond her to someone he knew was waiting in the shadows.

"We're late," he said. "You can join</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:48
