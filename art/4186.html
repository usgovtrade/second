Innovations in service strategy and application development are having a significant impact on the way businesses are running. Modernized application development, mobile delivery and orchestration, the Internet of Things and analytics and real-time service monitoring are all part of our new digital age. A recent research report found that a single, complex and interconnected application in this cloud native era generates up to an astonishing 11 terabytes of data per month, and the growth of data being generated by businesses every year now surpasses global, regional, and industry specific growth of GDP by all of the industries in the IT sector.

Our vision is simple, but we need your help to make it happen.

Learn how your organization can use the same technologies, in the same place, to reach your customers wherever they are at that moment. The Cloud Expo can be utilized as a platform to bridge and unite various stakeholders in IT.

Cloud Expo will also host the first-ever SaaS, PaaS, and MPS (marketing process services) Providers Expo. SaaS providers need to be represented to grow their platform to reach new customers. This year we are attracting SaaS providers to present and learn how to grow their businesses with our customers. This provides a tremendous opportunity for SaaS providers, as they present to the largest database of IT decision makers in the country!

In addition to the agenda, we have expanded our event into a community driven conference. We will continue to have world class, focused educational content delivered by industry leading speakers. At the end of the day, the goal of all of our work is to enable and empower more people in our industry to take control of their career and future. Cloud Expo Silicon Valley will continue to do just that. The SaaS cloud market is at an inflection point. Companies need to transform their business models to address opportunities, changing demands and trends in the market. Success in the SaaS market, as well as their overall business depends on organizations’ ability to implement changes to grow revenue and reduce costs.
