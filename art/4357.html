"You tell everyone your whole life story." "Let me see if I can put this in terms you'll understand." "I'm a person, Matt." "I have a heart and a soul." "And you, you are a rock." "People try to move you." "They can't." "You're like a boulder." "People walk around you." "They think you're empty." "You are empty." "Come on, get up!" "Why did you fall off the bike?" "You should've seen the state of your bike, Nick." "It's a piece of crap." "I'm gonna go eat some sugar." "Sounds about right." "It's not fair, Nick." "I mean, how come Dad gets to go to the bathroom whenever he wants?" "He just has to tell you, that's all." "You can't go until you go." "You can't go until you go." "You can't repeat everything I say." "Dad's boss is such a dick." "What did you say, Nick?" "I said..." "What did you say?" "I said Dad's boss is such a dick." "Okay, Nick." "No sugar." "What did you say, Nick?" "Aren't you gonna do something?" "Nick, the bathroom is not a toy." "Please take a bath." "Jesus Christ, Nick." "What did you say?" "I said, the bag." "Give me that bag!" "That's my bag." "Sorry." "Sorry doesn't mean anything." "I said, give me that bag!" "You're not my dad." "You can't tell me what to do." "I'm gonna go to the bathroom." "All right." "Okay." "Good and loud." "You remember that deal we made?" "Yes, Mom." "You remember that deal we made?" "And you haven't done anything to hurt anyone, have you?" "No." "That's right." "Good."

"They're crap." "No, no, you got Dad in trouble." "Mom and Dad are getting divorced." "What do you care?" "What do I care?" "Mom and Dad are getting divorced." "What do you care?" "Because we're sisters." "We're supposed to look out for each other, and you didn't even bother to ask me how I felt." "You had to find out on your own." "And you know what?" "It kind of sucks." "Right." "I don't care how you feel." "You don't care about anyone but yourself." "You don't care about anyone but yourself." "Do you know what it's like to go through life with no one to take care of you?" "Everyone taking you for granted." "Do you?" "Do you?" "I'm sorry about what I said about the credit card."

"You're not my mommy!" "Mom!" "Let go." "Please let go." "It's okay, it's okay." "Mom!" "Mom!" "You have to get out of here." "You have to get out of here." "I can't do it anymore." "I don't care what you did, okay?" "It doesn't matter what happened." "All that matters is you're my little girl, and I love you so much." "Okay?" "Please, please get out of here." "Go get dressed."
