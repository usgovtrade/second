I always like to look around me and see what I can improve, whether it’s technology, a product or myself, and I feel that we are very much doing that. The name comes from a couple of different things. It’s from the fact that I love video games and my passion is to make them. I always want to try and push technology even further and think that technology can help give people the opportunity for a better experience. And then at the same time, we are also trying to play with language and also not really caring about what everybody thinks. It’s more of a reaction to my personal surroundings, because it’s almost always positive feedback.

That’s the reason why we go with that name. The company exists in New York, the East Coast. We are not even on the West Coast yet, but we are starting to get some traction and buzz around the tech scene here in New York. That’s what we are trying to make sure that this name represents. It’s not just a cute name, it’s a name that will stick with people. It’s a name that will put a little bit more confidence in what we’re doing.

I’m a lifelong New Yorker who came to California for undergrad. This has always been my home. I’ve lived here all my life, and just for me, it is my world. That being said, I do try to travel as much as possible, whether it’s throughout Europe or Asia, because I just love culture, history, music and food.

“One Bad Wolf” is very similar to startups that are based in LA and the idea of Silicon Beach and startups in that area. But you’re based in New York?

It’s all relative. Everyone has their world and their views. I personally haven’t met anyone that has been offended by the name or the name “Bad Wolf” or anything like that. There might be some people that I know personally that I don’t think are aware of the name.

No, not to my knowledge. But it doesn’t bother me if people don’t like the name. We are just trying to make a positive name for ourselves and that’s why we didn’t really pay much attention to what the general public is calling us. It’s just a matter of respect for myself, and respect for what we’re doing.

It’s a reflection of the company and what we want to be known for and the fact that it is a different style of communication. We want to be more of a creative company than a creative agency. And to me, that’s what we want to be known for.

We have a lot of plans, and we definitely have plans that are very different from anything you have seen here. If you look at what a lot of traditional agencies have been doing, especially in the past ten years, there are only so many things that I can think of that are original. It’s either something about a funny name or what you’re wearing or something. You get tired of those things. And that is why I think we have our own perspective of how we want to approach things.

Just from what I’ve seen, I think it’s definitely a good perspective. At the end of the day, every company has its own unique way of doing things.

Yeah. We want to just try to do new stuff. I don’t want to say every agency is not creative or thinking in new ways, but I feel like we need to take risks and try to push ourselves as far as we can and maybe take some risks. Because I don’t want to spend all my life being an accountant. It’s not for me. And that’s just me.

But in general, with me, I’ve been a part of most of the advertising and brand-building campaigns. I was a music director at a music video company in New York, so I did that for a couple of years. And after that, I started doing my own thing. I was doing freelance PR, helping out different brands and stuff like that. And then I started working with these different startups and different companies.

Now I am working with TechCrunch. This past year has been full of different things and so many different types of meetings and experiences that have come along with that. I started getting into the music industry more in the past year, as well. Now I’m working with some artists and the marketing and PR for different artists. I’m really just kind of all over the map, which is how I like to be. I like to experience things, because I feel like as a human, I learn so much from experience and so much from other people.

Do you think that you can bring any of that experience to the tech world?

Oh, for sure. I think just being from New York and being a lifelong New Yorker really brings things to the table. I mean, my whole life, everything was made here in New York. I was born and raised here. I went to school here. I travel around the city and eat in every different restaurant that I can. It just gives you a whole different type of perspective that most other people don’t have. And that’s something that’s hard to find these days in a lot of people’s heads.

And a lot of the time, it’s that we are very closed-off to ideas and how we see things, because we see things through the lens of what we have experienced and what we are familiar with. But with the new generation of the internet, the younger generation, they just come from an entirely different culture and a completely different perspective. And they don’t really know how to see things in a whole new light, and this is something that’s happening to all businesses. This is the age of millennials and the generation Y, and they are just coming in and changing everything.

We are in a very unique position. We have a lot of resources that we can use to get things done quickly and efficiently, but we are also focused on the right things. We are focusing on people, our brand, our name. It’s all about really trying to do different things. We are trying to do something for the next generation.

A lot of advertising agencies try to be “cool,” or get a little edgy and crazy. But the reason they do it is because they want to get bigger accounts, bigger clients and things like that. But we’re not really focusing on that. We are focusing on taking care of people that are our clients, people that we work with and are involved with our company.

I think a lot of business comes down to how you brand yourself and what people get from you, and we are just trying to put everything into that, making sure that we don’t go overboard with the amount of fun we have, because it could lose its meaning. We just want to be authentic and have fun with it all. We are not going to be one of those creative agencies, and we are not going to take everything so seriously. It’s going to come across as very laid-back, and we’re definitely trying to create something that’s going to last for a long time.

What does the Bad Wolf mean in your mind? Is it symbolic of something? What are your thoughts behind it?

Not really. I think it’s just one of those catchy words that we can apply to this. The concept is always just about finding creative ideas and bringing them all together in a unified environment. Just like how we say, “The more, the merrier,” that’s the way we try to bring everything together. I think it’s a lot more about taking risks and having fun and being creative.

I have an open mind, and I really try not to think of negatives at all, because I think that’s another negative influence that makes us go overboard. If you start thinking too much about things and overanalyzing things, it’s going to be harder. I think it’s important to have fun and try to put it in simple terms, and have fun with it.

How long have you been involved in the advertising world?

It’s been since my sophomore year of college. I started as an advertising major, and that’s the same thing I want to do now. I just started working as a freelance publicist and as a creative director for a music video company. That’s where I first met Paul. And that’s where my interest in doing music PR and digital things really came from. It was very collaborative work, creating videos and working with artists. That’s how I met Paul. That’s when we really started working together, with him working with the artists I was working with, and I ended up doing music PR for a lot of artists as well. That was an interesting twist of how things worked out.

It was a little bit of a different experience, and it’s definitely been an interesting journey.

What do you like about the industry? Do you think there is any reason you might change paths later on?

I love the fact that it’s changing constantly. One of the reasons that I like it is because of the constant innovation. At least when I was a creative director, every day I was finding new opportunities, new ways to do things, and I just love that.
