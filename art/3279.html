"I think the word gamer is so vague, to call yourself a gamer you need to have an opinion about what you're playing, I have seen a lot of people call themselves gamers and they really don't know what the term really means and some of them even do that in public to show how cool they are."

“I think if you have any true love for video games then you should get an original controller (for the game of your choice) and throw the old one away, because at some point or another you should have a new controller.”

“Don't feel pressured into having sex after a date; if you're having a nice time then go ahead, but it should be at the time that makes you both comfortable, not because you feel awkward.”

“Not all games have a purpose to kill, some games want you to save other creatures, there are games out there to have fun with friends, that don't make you pay for the game. Games aren't for children either.”

“When it comes to getting away from your game, you need to do something to clear your head, but don't overdo it with video games.”

“I used to play games like “Mortal Combat 4” and “Age of Empires” a lot of time because I didn't want to go to school because I got sick. One day, I woke up and I was playing for 2 or 3 hours straight, because I was playing those two games and didn't want to get out of my room.”

“I was playing the Nintendo Gamecube and it was my first time playing and I guess you can say that it was a little bit better than the Nintendo 64”

“Well, I've known about video games ever since I was a little kid and I was always playing video games, so naturally it came to me like a normal person, there is no other way I could be anything else, I'm a gamer.”

“This is a little thing to consider for some people, if you don't have the money to buy a Wii, then I would suggest getting a Play Station 2 or maybe even a Nintendo 64, they're the next best things. “

“There are many things that you can play and have fun doing. If you love playing or want to play them more than your parents, then they have a place where they can be played and a place to buy the things you need. If you are a parent, try it out and if you don't like it, it's pretty much safe to say it's not for you, if you're looking for something to play with, then it's much better.”

“No, you can't do that, don't you want to live forever and be able to live like you do now forever and ever?”

“When it comes to games, it's your choice whether you want to use the same one every day or not, if not, then you should pick your game and choose something different every day. Just like real life, you have choices to make everyday. ”

“If you look at it from a different perspective and you think about it, if the money that the companies made was to keep you from the possibility of ever wanting to do a thing, then it should be easy for them to refuse it, because the moment they refuse, you will never think about trying to get it again. Also, think about all of the time that people have wasted watching games instead of doing other things, games are a lot of fun but they are not as fun as what other people are doing. ”

“You can go out and play games, watch movies, or go to a library and you will see that there are things you can do that you could never do before. ”

“You have to take the time and enjoy playing that game. Make it a part of your life, play it as if it was going to be your last game, enjoy the fact that you're spending time with the people you're playing it with and don't take it for granted and don't waste the time it takes to play it. Get out there and have fun!”

“People have many different ways to spend their time and when you're a busy person, you don't always have time to sit and do nothing like watching a video game, because time is important to people. People should find something that they like doing and spend as much time with it as possible, whether it's video games or playing in the park or just sitting on the couch all day, if they have enough money to buy it, then let them, if they don't have enough money to buy it, then they should get money. People should not be limited to the little stuff that they can afford. ”

“You can buy it online. All you need is the number of the game and the code. After you pay for it, you will get it instantly. It doesn't really work that way if you don't get the right code. You can also try to look at a site that tells you codes of different games. If you're going to sell it for a lot, sell it at a reputable site that pays for stuff. People can easily get your game now and sell it online.”

“It's kind of confusing to me when people talk about their lives like that. I know people who have said they wanted to be in a video game, but they have worked hard, and spent all their money on the video game and even then, it hasn't come through. Now, they have to start all over again and they end up working really hard in a job that they hate so that they can get a new video game and enjoy their time.”

“I think if you want to go out and buy a new video game, then you should save your money and keep it, so you can buy whatever you want to, then you can enjoy it the whole time because it will be yours. I think the thing about it is you never know when the money that they take from your paycheck is going to end. It's good to save for the moments you don't want to worry about anymore. You can try asking your parents if they will help you out with it or maybe they would buy it for you so you can feel a little better about spending your money.”

“It all depends on what your heart says, if you want to go out and buy yourself one, then go ahead. Make sure that you are saving up and saving up enough so that</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:54
