<nairwolf> Hi, I'm trying to connect remotely from a Debian to a kvm-deployment on a Ubuntu Server, but it's not working. It seems that dhcp is not working, but I don't know why
<nairwolf> I tried to activate dhcp and ssh on the vm-manager from my main computer, then it ask me my ip. After that, I tried to run 'sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart' on the vm-manager but nothing has changed. And I can't connect remotely on a ssh connection
<sdeziel> nairwolf: did you try to check that your DHCP server is listening on the right port?
<nairwolf> sdeziel: Yes, I'm using a debian server, and the dhcp server is listening on udp and tcp
<nairwolf> I mean dhcp3-server listening
<nairwolf> But dhcp server is running
<sdeziel> nairwolf: do you have the server's network up and running?
<nairwolf> Yes, I can ping it
<nairwolf> I don't know why it is not working
<nairwolf> With Debian, I can access my vm with 'ssh me@vm'
<nairwolf> But with Ubuntu, I can't
<sdeziel> nairwolf: is DHCP activated in the "virtual" machine?
<nairwolf> I don't know, where should I check that ?
<sdeziel> nairwolf: with virtual machines, I usually use the console to check the settings of the VMs. Is that not working on your side too?
<nairwolf> the config says dhcp activated. When I ping the machine with the network interface, it's replying, so network must be working. But I don't know why it's not working
<sdeziel> nairwolf: could you try connecting to the guest using a host other than your local host (the one that runs the virtual manager)
<sdeziel> nairwolf: there must be some setting that disables this functionality but it's non obvious
<nairwolf> I'll try to do something else
<nairwolf> thanks for your help
<nairwolf> It is not working now
<nairwolf> I can't connect
<nairwolf> But it's strange, when I use the console of the server and I ping the network interface, it's working. But when I try to connect from the local host, it's not working
<nairwolf> The network interface is working
<sdeziel> nairwolf: is your VM configured to have a bridged connection?
<nairwolf> I don't know exactly what it means. But I'm pretty sure it's enabled
<sdeziel> nairwolf: in the IPAM configuration
<sdeziel> nairwolf: are you using a bridge to forward your guest's traffic from the host?
<nairwolf> The VM is vmWare, and the IPAM is 'dhcp'
<sdeziel> nairwolf: to confirm, can you pastebin the IPAM configuration?
<nairwolf> I'm not sure what is bridge, but I'm pretty sure the network is working from the console
<nairwolf> ipam = ip address management
<nairwolf> where is the config of that ?
<nairwolf> (I'm on a vm)
<nairwolf> ah, I found it, the /etc/ipa-adm/ipa-adm.conf
<sdeziel> nairwolf: for dhcp ipam: https://github.com/ipa-sysadmin/ipa/blob/master/docs/networks.rst#network-parameters
<nairwolf> This is my configuration, I don't see a bridge enabled, and my vm network is attached to the host
<nairwolf> Oh, I have a virtual network
<nairwolf>  /etc/ipa/default-network.cfg
<nairwolf> But I don't think it's what is doing this
<sdeziel> nairwolf: if you disable the "virtual_network" option, does it fix your issue?
<nairwolf> I'll try
<nairwolf> No, it doesn't fix my issue
<nairwolf> Ok, the virtual network is disabled, but I'm still not sure what I need to do to enable connection from a vm
<nairwolf> sdeziel: Do you have any idea ?
<sdeziel> nairwolf: bridge networking on VMware: https://askubuntu.com/questions/752064/how-to-configure-bridge-interface-in-vmware-workstation-13-with-kvm
<sdeziel> nairwolf: you probably already tried https://forum.ovh.com/showthread.php?122680-Openstack-3-on-Debian-9-5-18-04-VirtualBox-issue
<nairwolf> Yes, I did that
<nairwolf> I tried also : https://askubuntu.com/questions/1062/how-to-access-a-private-ubuntu-kvm-vm-from-outside
<nairwolf> But my ip address is not the VM ip address
<sdeziel> nairwolf: and this one too: https://serverfault.com/questions/641035/can-i-set-the-host-network-interface-to-any-address-when-using-bridged-mode
<nairwolf> sdeziel: Ok, I'll try. I really have no more idea, and I'm sick of this :/
<sdeziel> nairwolf: any luck?
<nairwolf> sdeziel: I'm at it for hours.
<sdeziel> nairwolf: have you tried creating a NAT network?
<sdeziel> that's a common workaround for networking with virtualization
<nairwolf> oh, I didn't know that
<sdeziel> nairwolf: create a new network with: ip link add link eth0 name eth0.10 type veth peer name eth0.1001
<nairwolf> I'm going to try that
<sdeziel> nairwolf: this way, the VM will have a eth0:1 virtual NIC that you can connect to using the public address of the host machine
<nairwolf> ok
<nairwolf> But I have another problem
<nairwolf> In fact, it is not really a server problem. I'm going to explain what I have to do
<nairwolf> I want to access a website hosted in a private network. So I have to be sure I'm connected to the internet to access it. I don't understand if it is possible or not. It seems that the server doesn't work without internet connection.
<sdeziel> nairwolf: the way I see it, you have 2 problems: how to make the host get the right IP address and how to get the host to access the VPN
<sdeziel> the first one should be solvable with the virtual bridge
<nairwolf> Ok, I think that we were wrong. The VM isn't running on the same interface that I can ping from the console
<nairwolf> I'm going to try to ping it from another host. Maybe that helps me understand if it is working or not
<sdeziel> nairwolf: you mentioned you have a gateway configured in the VM. Could you pastebin the output of netstat -rn ?
<nairwolf> sdeziel: You're right, I tried to ping from another host, and it's working
<nairwolf> But I still have the issue, I can't connect to my VM
<sdeziel> nairwolf: ok, I think I'm going to take a break now. Good luck with your issue and try to ask again in 30min or so
<nairwolf> sdeziel: OK

<ubottu> Launchpad bug 1798522 in python-json-patch (Ubuntu) "SRU python-json-patch in Ubuntu Bionic" [Medium,Triaged]
<marc__> Question:  This appears to be a bug with the ZFS on Ubuntu 19.10 -- The UFS (the default filesystem for Ubuntu 19.10) doesn't allow one of the user's own scripts to change the ZFS pool offline property.  However, with UFS I would not have zpool offline=yes on a ZFS filesystem.  What's going on?
<marc__> This is for using Ubuntu with ZFS on root and not using luks encryption.
<sarnold> marc__: please file a bug report; I think you should file it against 'zfs-linux' instead of 'zfs'
<marc__> okay -- will do
