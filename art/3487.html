"We're the good guys." "Right." "You two are just passing through, right?" "Are you gonna tell us what's going on?" "Okay, what are you talking about?" "Hey, everybody." "Everyone who has a weapon should get it out and show it to us!" "Whoa!" "These guys have already taken over the entire place." "We can't stop the show." "What do we do?" "You know what to do." "Whoa!" "Heads up!" "Heads up!" "Now, you two had better do something... or I'll have to take action, and you're right, I'm gonna get a little angry." "I'm gonna come at you in my cop voice." "So hear me." "That's better." "A little loud, a little angry, and very annoying." "You think that's what people should sound like?" "You told me once to smile more." "I like smiling!" "It opens up all kinds of opportunities." "Like this, for example." "You be a good little meat puppet... and smile at me now." "I don't think of you as a meat puppet." "Then what am I?" "A lamb?" " No, not a... not a lamb." " A chicken?" "No, a... an emotional." "It's not an emotional." "It's just a figure of speech." "Oh!" "What a bunch of nonsense!" "And for your information, you can do a lot more than just smile." "That's just the tip of the iceberg." "Why are you taking pictures of us?" "What do you want?" "That's the question you should be asking." "What do you want from us?" "I want you to stop bringing us food and drink and..." "And what?" "You'll forgive me if I don't take orders from you." "We're running out of control." "What are you doing here?" "This is our operation." "It's your operation." "No." "It's their operation." "Look." "We know them?" "Hey, buddy." "Huh?" "Where did they come from?" "They came out of the sky." "Out of the sky, huh?" "He knows something." "You can't trust him." "He's one of them!" "I know he's not." "We're gonna find out who he is." "Then you can shoot him." "Don't waste the bullets, I have plenty of backups." "I wanna get to the bottom of this thing." "Well, we can't do that with him walking around." "That's a smart dog." "That's a genius dog." "He's right." "We can't do this with him in here." "Now, wait a second." "Wait a second." "I was gonna say something." "I agree." "I want you out of here." "Me, too." "He's not one of us." "That's for me to decide!" "Go on!" "Get outta here!" "What was that?" "You are a freak." "No, no." "No, no, no, no." "No, no." "No, no, no." "No, no!" "That's weird." "Hey, what are you doing?" "I thought I could trust you." "Hey!" "Let me out!" "Let me outta here!" "Help!" "Let me outta here!" "This place is gonna blow!" "It's gonna blow!" "Let me outta here!" "Help!" "Help me!" "Help me!" "Help me!" "Let me out of here!" "Let me outta here!" "Let me outta here!" "Help me!" "Ah!" "They've got the door locked." "Why'd you lock the door?" "He was out of his mind." "Not my problem." "So you think he's really crazy?" "No, I thought he was for a while, but not anymore." "Well, what happened?" "I saw his file." "Before he was a patient, he worked here, got fired for insubordination." "He almost ruined this place." "He's got an IQ of 180." "It's only affected his behavior." "You think he can look after himself?" "I guess we're gonna find out." "This isn't so bad, huh?" "Not as bad as the basement at the Dix." "You had to sleep in the basement at the Dix?" "No way." "Well, then what did you sleep on?" "Harsh." "Oh, man, this is good!" "Really?" "Yeah, I'm serious." "Really?" "Yeah, come on!" "I hate peanuts!" "All right, if we're gonna walk, we need a direction." "Yeah, like that's gonna happen." "It's like we're just throwing bread and running off into the woods." "What's that?" "Some sort of weird, glowing bread?" "Are you seeing what I'm seeing?" "Look at that." "What is it?" "What do you think they're all doing?" "Making a huge poopie?" "That's not poop." "Is that poop?" "Poop?" "That's the edge of town!" "Okay, we don't have much time." "Gus, can you lead us to the bus?" "I don't know, kids." "I've only ever led two other groups of travelers here." "I have no idea if I can do it again." "Don't worry, Gus, we'll get you there." "We'll get everyone there." "I promise." "Good luck!" "Good luck!" "Okay, keep together." "Remember, it's just like a tour, but different." "Do we really look that much like aliens?" "I just think it's better if we don't draw any attention to ourselves." "Greetings, friend." "This is amazing." "Not as amazing as an open hole in the desert." "Can we go back to our spaceship now?" "No." "That's too dangerous." "What if we get lost?" "Let's just stay on the path." "It's got to be better than this." "Yeah, it doesn't get any better than this." "I know." "It's awesome." "It's a little bright." "All right, it's your turn now." "You take the first watch." "But watch what?" "I'll be able to sleep during the day?" "Not really sleep, more like catnap." "Hey, what are you doing?" "No, no, no, no, no, no." "You can't do this." "Don't you remember what the man said?" "Yeah." "How we should stay in the sun or else." "You know, we have to stay out of the sun so it doesn't get tired." "Look, I got to tell you something, because if I don't, I'll probably blow it and it's gonna ruin everything." "He lied to us." "See, the man lied to us." "The man didn't want us here." "That guy over there, he lied." "He didn't want to tell us that there was no bus." "He let us go on an insane, deadly goose chase for his own selfish reasons." "We didn't find the bus because he wanted us to." "The man lied to us." "So you're saying that he's bad?" "Yeah." "Yeah, he's bad." "Okay, come on." "Come on." "Okay." "Let's go find our bus." "That was close!" "Yeah, I had this feeling we weren't alone out here." "Yeah, me, too." "Oh!" "Ugh!" "What do you think that means?" "I don't know, but I think that it's pretty clear what it means." "I don't know." "They might not even be able to speak our language yet." "No, no, it's pretty clear what it means." "It means "Let's get out of here."" "No, wait a second." "Let's just, you know..." "Let's just..." "Just wait a second." "Maybe they think we're being chased by another alien." "Yeah, right." "What is wrong with you?" "And what do you think we're gonna do in our spaceship?" "Just fly around and try to avoid them until they go back to their planet?" "That's your plan?" "That's not our plan." "That's a bad plan." "Well, at least we have a plan." "Maybe they don't have a plan." "You know what, we should follow them." "You really think so?" "Yeah, it's fine." "Come on." "What's the worst that can happen?" "Are you done with this?" "I can't do this." "You want some help with that?" "Do you mind?" "You can't do it?" "No." "You got it, buddy." "Here you go." "I know I said that I was done with this, but now I'm not so sure." "If we go this way, we can't go to the bus." "You think you can just leave me in here?" "Well, no, but I don't really have a choice, do I?" "Hey, what do you want from</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:21
