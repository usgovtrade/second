Cast

Production

David Hayter reprises his role as Jack Slate from the 1988 original. The film is shot in chronological order from first shot to final. Most of the film is played out in the mind of an elderly man, played by the late James Whitmore, who is suffering from dementia. The elderly man (the "old man") is seen dreaming about the first two films, but most of the shots in the film are not directly related to him. This allows the viewer to see events from a new perspective. By changing perspectives to someone else's memory, David Lynch changed the tone and style of the story. In this film, instead of a noir with a dark tone like the previous films, the audience sees a brighter and warmer tone; and the plot is now a comedy with comedic and humorous dialogue, as opposed to the previous films, in which it was a gritty crime drama. 
The film was screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, and the Los Angeles premiere took place on June 12, 2013. At Cannes, Lynch stated that "The Lone Rider" was "really funny."

Reception
The Lone Rider received positive reviews from critics, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting the film had a "certified fresh" rating of 83%, based on 68 reviews, with a consensus stating: "David Lynch explores familiar elements from the "Twin Peaks" mythos and creates a darkly comic crime mystery that's as haunting as it is amusing."
