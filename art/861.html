new data to conclude the simpler explanation is the correct one.  The data 
suggests the increase in heating demand over the last decade has not been 
matched by a proportional increase in heating capacity.  Although there has 
been some slight increase in capacity, it is not enough to meet the 
additional demand.  As the end of the decade approaches, this mismatch 
between demand and supply will become more and more stark.  Based on this 
analysis, we have concluded that neither an upgrade of the current pipeline 
systems nor the construction of new transmission lines is a sustainable or 
desirable option for the future. 

The situation is particularly acute for Eastern Canadian Gas Transmission, 
which is a single line from the Alberta/Saskatchewan Border to New York.  
This line is currently being used at around half of its capacity.  Because of 
the line,s limited capacity, the delivery point is limited to the AECO area. 

Based on the foregoing, we have created a detailed project schedule to act as 
a guide for the entire project.  However, given the number of variables in 
the proposal, it is likely that the project will require more detailed 
information to proceed further at this time. 
Efforts to obtain a greater level of understanding must be coordinated 
between TransCanada, National Energy Board (NEB), Federal Agencies, US & 
Canadian Governments, and other potential partners and stakeholders.  As you 
will see, the project schedule is complex and requires a significant amount 
of work for the next three months. 

We are looking forward to working with you, and if you have any questions or 
require additional assistance please do not hesitate to contact myself, Rob 
Waugh, Leslie Lawner, John Novak or Jeff Keeler. 

Thank You,

Subject: Preliminary 2001 Integrated Production/Cost Estimate



Attached is an estimate of combined production and cost for new and 
continued projects for 2001.  This estimate is based on the decisions that 
Enron's west business units have made regarding new projects and 
approximately 60 percent of the corporatewide projects that will be completed 
next year.  This work will be coordinated with the individual project 
schedules that are under way throughout Enron. 
Although this schedule was formulated with the assumption that successful 
completion of all corporate projects will be guaranteed, there is too much 
uncertainty surrounding the projects and costs to  be certain of the actual 
costs. In addition, the    level of any increase in the price of oil, LNG or 
other commodities this year will also significantly impact the 2001 
schedule. Therefore, this schedule is only an estimate of Enron's potential 
costs. The final schedule and costs will be formulated when the individual 
project schedule are finalized throughout Enron.

Please keep this schedule confidential.
