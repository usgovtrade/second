Pitcher-friendly Oakland Park to host A's
The San Francisco Chronicle
Saturday, February 24, 2001

<mailto:mmccorm@sfchronicle.com>

  A's fans, rejoice: The Oakland Coliseum Authority board has voted to bring 
your favorite local nine back to the East Bay.

  Beginning in May, and continuing every other Sunday for the 2001 season, 
Oakland's spacious Oakland Park will be the scene of A's games as it was in 
the 1970s, the years when the A's played two games a year at the 66-year-old 
ballpark.

  The A's share of Oakland Park will be only seven years old, but it will have 
the retro feel that makes Coliseum faithfuls nostalgic. The A's will play on 
the original grass infield, which has never been replaced. The outfield 
fences are in good shape, but the bleachers, which once housed 24,000 
fans, are in shambles, with 1,500 seats still available. The grandstand 
itself will be upgraded with bench seats, which were missing from the 
Coliseum's original design.

  The A's will also return to Oakland Park's original dimensions -- 325 feet 
to left and right and 400 to center field. A's coaches will marvel at the 
pitches that used to sail over the fence at the Coliseum, but still leave 
home plate relatively alone. The scoreboard, with its familiar mascot 
headaches, will return, and that's not all. A's fans will be treated to 
other reminders of the glory days: The park will be a replica of the former 
A's home at the Oakland Coliseum.

Tribe's Martinez to miss start with blister
Associated Press

<mailto:troy.martinez@chron.com>

CLEVELAND - One of Cleveland's newest and most valuable players probably won't 
be in the starting lineup when his team opens a new downtown ballpark next 
weekend. Joe Martinez sprained his left big toe on Thursday when he slipped 
on the wet outfield grass of Cleveland's new Jacobs Field before hitting his 
second home run of the exhibition season. The injury could have cost Martinez 
and the Indians a spot in the starting lineup for their season opener 
Saturday night. Martinez was in the lineup as the designated hitter in the 
third game of the exhibition season Thursday. Cleveland opens the regular 
season Monday night at Seattle. "I didn't think anything of it when it happened 
and didn't even realize it at the time," Martinez said. "The swelling was 
coming up on me, and then it started to get a little tender." The team 
suspected the toe might be fractured, said trainer Nick Paparesta. He took an 
X-ray and then kept Martinez out of the starting lineup to give him a 
chance to rest and have the toe checked by a doctor on Friday morning. 
Martinez said he was confident the toe would be OK. Martinez said his next 
baseball activity will determine whether he's in the lineup on Saturday. "If 
I can go, then it's no big deal," he said. The Indians were using 
defensive-minded pitchers Rick Krivda and Dan Smythe to start the exhibition 
games, so the loss of Martinez wouldn't hurt them. He wasn't sure what he 
hopes to do with his broken toe on a day when he's usually up at 5 a.m. for 
a 6 a.m. game. "Maybe I'll just go to the movies and sit in the cold tub," 
he said.

A's, Rays close in on stadium deal
The Associated Press
Friday, February 23, 2001

TAMPA, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays and Oakland Athletics are close to finalizing 
a deal that would place a retractable-roof ballpark on the downtown waterfront 
in St. Petersburg, a leading developer said Thursday. 
The team owner, Vince Naimoli, would pay $50 million for 50 acres of city land 
along the bay. His company would also contribute at least $35 million toward 
the ballpark.
The Trop, as the park is nicknamed, is scheduled to open in time for the 2003 
season. The Rays, who are considering Anaheim and Portland, Ore., for their 
new ballpark, would play about 20 home games a year at St. Petersburg's 
Florida Auto Exchange Park.
St. Petersburg officials were preparing to seek state approval for the 
project on Thursday. If the city and the Rays agree on a lease for the ball 
park, the team would get a $3.5 million, 20-year base to build it. 
Naimoli said he hopes to have a signed lease with the city by July 4. 
"If we get it done, it'll be a good ballpark. I think it will be a good team 
and a good community," said Naimoli, who declined to say how much the team 
would pay him.
The city would contribute about $10 million toward the stadium, and the rest 
would come from the Rays and the state. The deal, which has been in the 
making for about a year, was approved by St. Petersburg's City Council on 
Wednesday. 
While the Rays' prospective new home might be named for a vehicle used in car 
sales, the team's colors would be bright orange and teal.
"It's an orange field with a teal roof," said Pat Courtney, vice president of 
the Rays. "What more can you ask for? It's Florida." 
Naimoli said he met with the developer of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' $192 
million, 55,000-seat stadium, on Thursday to talk about development of the 
Trop. 
The Rays also are considering other stadium sites in St. Petersburg, Tarpon 
Springs and Orlando, as well as Anaheim and Portland, for the team's 
home. 
Naimoli said he is talking to Orlando officials, but no deal is imminent. 
"At this point, I can't say there's an agreement," Naimoli said. 
Naimoli said he would not consider a stadium built on property owned by</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:18
