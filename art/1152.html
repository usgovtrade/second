This was the first song written by the band, and was their first single. It was written by guitarist/vocalist Mike Jones and original bassist Johnny Sandlin, while the drummer and bassist were still together. Its working title was "Bombshell." During a later interview with Blabbermouth, Jones explained that he "wanted it to sound like a big bomb going off, so we didn't want the drum machine. I wanted to see if everyone had to count the song, and we all counted and had a one-two-three-four feeling going on. It turned out to be a great experience."
