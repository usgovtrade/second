Little Lucy's Wonderful Globe.

(A Story for Very Young Girls.)

By Mrs. G. R. Alden.

    Illustrated by BERTHA H. BECKWITH.

    Price      $1.25.


A wonderfully true and faithful little tale about a young English
girl who had been an invalid, and had to spend a portion of each year
at a watering place, and who had often expressed a desire to have a
baby to take out with her in the steamer to make her journey more
cheerful. One day she was told that the "Stork" had come, and in an
instant the news was all over the house, and she was almost wild with
delight. Her family were, however, much perplexed to know where the
baby was going to be born, and the doctor suggested that they should
send word to the great Lord High Admiral at Portsmouth, and he would
tell them. The very next day a letter came from the Stork's "office,"
saying that the Queen of England wanted a baby of her own, and that
she had determined to make Lucy's little brother a present.

The "Wonderful Globe" was an enormous globe, and when its beautiful
shining surface was removed Lucy peeped within and saw all manner of
beautiful things. First she discovered her great brother Jack (she
never could decide which she liked the best), and in her excitement
was so naughty that she was banished to the nursery, and had to leave
her beloved "Wonderful Globe" behind her, and the other toys too. Her
grandfather then took possession, and she went to bed, and there lay
in a beautiful new bed a tiny little brother, in his pretty white
frock; and then began the question, "Where shall we take him?" Lucy
had never known a brother, and could not tell where he should be
taken; and after a while her uncle Tom said, "Now let's take him to
Lucy's Wonderful Globe, it's much too big for him to begin with, but we
will make it grow."

The "Stork" was full of wrath when she came to know of Lucy's
behaviour; but when Lucy took her little brother, and said that she
would never get into mischief any more, her great grandfather said he
should tell the Stork that "she was the best friend the little one had
had, and that she could stay with us always." And when Lucy showed the
Stork her beautiful "Wonderful Globe" and her lovely gold watch, the
Stork grew quite pleased, and said, "I will tell you when I want her
back," and then she went away and there was great rejoicing at the
family.

Little Lucy's Wonderful Globe has become a very favorite book, and
many young girls delight to read it.

Little Sister's Story of the "Twins"

(A Story for Young Girls.)

By Mrs. M. A. Aldrich.

    Price      $1.25.


Sister Jane loved to hear stories, so when the boys were away, she used
to listen to "Mother's" stories of her own young days, as she used to
call them. One morning when she was seven, she was told by her mother
that she might go to see her Aunt Hannah, who was visiting at the
other end of the hall, and find her some books. A little more noise,
and perhaps she would not have heard the answer of "Mother" to her
question, "You tell her that you are very busy; that I have so many
things to do," and then the door was opened and she saw the little
golden head of a boy peeping in, a little brother of her own!

The child seemed unwilling to speak, but his mother said, "He has a
dreadful cold; but you must not mind it; he has been a patient baby
ever since he was born." And then the child spoke: "How do you do? What
are you doing? Where is my sissy? I think I see my sissy?"

Sister Jane took her little brother home, and was more busy than ever,
she was so happy to have him with her. When he was a very little
fellow he used to say, "Sis, you are the best thing in the whole wide
world," and Sister Jane always loved the first word of his little
speech.

When a baby is put into the mother's arms it is a new life beginning
for her and for all that she touches and belongs to.
