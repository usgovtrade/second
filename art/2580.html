And just when I thought everything was safe because of password managers, the
Washington Times comes and proves me wrong.

I can't find the original article, but this was some time ago when they were
relying on a third party vendor for a SSL cert.

The Times has not yet admitted it got hacked, and is being coy about the
details of how the breach occurred.

~~~
jameskegel
It's been a bit over a week, this article is the first time the identity of
the third party vendor has been revealed.

If you don't like this reporting, you can get the same kind of updates from
many other publications on a much more regular basis.

Yes, but unlike most other publications, the Washington Times publishes a lot
of opinion articles, as opposed to straight-up news articles. I would not want
to take my news from a publication where opinion articles are given as much or
more prominence than news articles. There are plenty of other sources of news
that can fill in for them.

This is the same company that fired/laid off almost the entire editorial staff
without warning or severance, a few years ago.

As a frequent reader and commenter, I'd like to point out: I've not seen that.
What's happened is they've split, and as the new, standalone news site is
doing better, they've re-instated staff - to what extent, I don't know.

~~~
trollahump
Maybe not _you_ specifically, but the vast majority of the writing staff is
either gone, or working at places with less prestige. Even before the
layoffs, it was a low-wage, low-status, content factory.

~~~
DanBC
And what do you want them to do? Become a niche paper for an American audience
on local US matters. Or, maybe just accept that the internet means that lots
of websites are just content farms, and offer cheap content farming to an
international audience?

The Times aren't known for great journalism. They're known for doing
competitive analysis about politics and finance in the US and UK.

Good, independent journalism isn't easy to do.

Why would they trust third party CAs with the encryption keys of their main
service?

~~~
tptacek
Because third-party certificate authorities are the _only_ way to secure TLS
on the Internet right now, and the Washington Times was using a third party
certificate.

The other way to get TLS on the Internet is to buy your own certificate from
one of the certificate authorities (or to get one from a company in the same
organization as a certificate authority), but most companies don't have the
technical talent to do that. Third party certificates are the only (semi-)
legitimate way of getting TLS on the Internet.

~~~

This is not accurate.

The certificate used was in fact issued by the Washington Times themselves. A
third party CA was not involved in the process.

~~~
tptacek
Yes it is accurate. Third-party CAs are the only way to secure TLS today.

~~~
jvehent
Why would they require a third party CA ? If they want to provide TLS, they
need only provide their certificate to their clients.

~~~
tptacek
Their certificate is in no way special. They could have bought it from a
company in the same organization as a CA. They could have paid the CA directly
to reissue it. There are many ways for a server to get TLS "right now". Third-
party CAs are the only ones involved in the business of selling such things.

Your argument would make sense, maybe, if you were explaining why it made no
sense for them to use an official CA.

The Washington Post has also been hacked as well[0]. How on earth can a
"responsible journalist" be hacked.

Does Washington Post really think that some teenager are gonna hack into their
servers?

Twitter hack != Washington Post hack.

So will the Times be able to sue them for violating their subscriber privacy?

~~~
krylon
They can probably sue, but it is hard to take an advertiser seriously if
their site is breached and the newspapers are trying to pin it on the
advertisers. I suspect they will have a difficult time proving it wasn't an
inside job.

so the attackers just had to look around, find the 3rd party, and re-use their
certs.
