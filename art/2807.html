We all have a little Brochacho (or at least think we do). You know the type of person we are talking about.

A Brochacho is someone who has one hobby and they don’t quit.

Brochachos are those people who stay up until midnight watching an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. Brochachos are those people who never get anything done because they love reading.

Brochachos are also those people who go shopping with one intention on their mind… which happens to be the first store they entered.

Brochachos are the ones who are known for their love of dogs. Who are also the ones who have two or three dogs. Brochachos are people who work long hours at the same job for 30 years. In other words, Brochachos are people you love and hate all in one!

Brochachos are interesting and unique in a world of people who are unoriginal. A Brochacho is an individual who knows what they love and will do whatever it takes to pursue it.

Brochachos are people who don’t run, but run toward the right thing.

Brochachos are the people who listen to you, not because they agree with you, but because they know that one day you will become them.

Brochachos are not afraid to fail, but are willing to fall down before they get back up.

A Brochacho is a person who has a passion in life and they love it when other people love their passion.

I want to be a Brochacho… and now you do too. I hope you can relate to this short story about Brochachos. What more can we say, other than keep on Brochachando!

One response to “Brochachos”

The meaning of Brochacho reminds me of what one of my professors in college told me about my life path. He said, “God put you on this earth to do one thing”. I wanted to be a psychiatrist, and while working with the elderly I started to realize the meaning of this remark. As God put us on earth to do what we were created to do we lose sight of that. As in business there are a lot of mundane jobs that have to be done because someone has to do them. In other words we are not doing the thing we were born to do. In the next life God wants us to be able to do whatever we choose to do because we are doing what we were created to do. We are here to learn and become that which our souls were designed for. Thank you, for giving us this perspective. It is one I will always try to maintain in my life. If I can be of any assistance in getting people to read this again, I’d appreciate it. Thank you.
