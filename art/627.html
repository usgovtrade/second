market development and expansion needs into ever greater levels of 
simplification. A recent example of this trend is EnronOnline, which originated 
as a highly-complicated solution to trading and order management problems and 
is now evolving towards becoming a simple XML-based system.  These trends are 
reflected in Enron's reduction in overall IT spending and a shift of focus to 
business line applications and down-stream solutions.  

Revitalizing our relationship with Enron
At the same time, we're working closely with Enron to leverage the combined 
areas of Enron's business and PwC's consulting services to gain maximum 
value for our clients in this rapidly expanding business environment.  Our 
joint solution to gain immediate access to Enron's finance and accounting 
information is well underway and is expected to wrap up in the near future. 
An example of the types of analysis we can offer based on this access is:
?
Develop PWC,s current and future global financial reporting capabilities, 
including its balance sheet consolidation and quarterly reporting capabilities
? 
Analyse Enron,s corporate tax situation, prepare its financial statements for 
review by Enron,s tax department, and perform assurance testing 
) necessary to ensure EGA compliance
? 
Develop future statutory consolidation and financial reporting requirements
? 
Work with Enron's tax department to develop an understanding of Enron,s 
current management strategy as it pertains to their consolidation and financial 
reporting requirements
? 
Validate that the existing consolidated financial statements are in 
compliance with the new statutory requirements

Please let me know if you would like to meet or talk about our strategies 
further.
