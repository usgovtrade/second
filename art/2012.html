The
other is the same but he has had very very little experience but his
parents brought him to the country when he was a very little
one. We have three children and they are both quite a year old.
I expect you to call upon us as soon as you can. My husband is not
very well, he was a victim to the epidemic of '98.'

A letter from a Mrs. Bevis, who wishes to engage a man to assist her
in housekeeping. (With this man, of course, my reader will be
acquainted.)

(Firstly, because they will have plenty of meat to eat, and
    plenty of fruit and bread and butter.)

(Secondly, because they will have enough to eat, and not enough to
    eat, too much.)

(Thirdly, because he has done enough, and there is no good in
    him.)

'Athens, Ga., June 26th, 1857.

'Mr. A. Thompson, Dear Sir:--I am a widow lady with four young
children, and wish to hire a black man who can do housework.

'I want a man who can get my work done, and if you could send me a
household slave, I would pay him handsomely, and be satisfied. I
would like to have a man who is handy, and can see that my husband's
Sunday clothes are kept clean and mended when they require it. Would
like to have a man who will come to meals, but don't wish to have
him to sleep with me.

'I have engaged a young boy for my husband, but I want a man if you
can furnish one. I have three children I would like to have trained,
and of course the man must be a good one. My husband is an invalid.
I would not like to employ one with a wife and children.

'If you can furnish a man, please let me know by return mail, or I
will come and see you.

'I am a lady, and can't write much, but please answer this in all
respects.

'I am your obedient servant,
   'Mrs. J. Bevis.'

A letter from one who seems quite anxious to start a new line of
business in New York.

'I have heard so much of your house cleaning and washing, and as you
are so well known to my family and relatives in Brooklyn, I thought
I would write you and see if you would go out to the West End, New
York, and take charge of some business for me. I will pay you all
expenses and give you twenty-five per cent. of profits. I have six
houses and can send you the work at once, and as I don't employ any
regular house-maid I can't write the number of hours you will have
to work, but it is not likely to be hard work. You will receive two
dollars and a half per week; a home; good bed; good meals; washing,
ironing, and cleaning. The hours of labour will be from 8 A.M. to
8 P.M. You can make your own arrangements as to the number of hours,
but of course you must not work more than eight. My husband has a
store in the village and you can attend to that in the morning. I am
writing this and want you to answer me right away, as I will send
you the first three months' salary for your answer. Address me as
soon as you receive this, and if you think you can make the terms,
let me hear from you.

'I am, Your obedient servant,
   'Mrs. D. W. W----.'

'Dear Sir:--Please attend to the enclosed in all respects. I have
great confidence in your being the right man for my purposes. As I
live at the other end of the city, will be glad to have you come and
see me so that we can understand each other. I only want one who can
do a general housework, and take charge of the wash and ironing, and
sweeping and so forth. It is best not to have the man sleep in the
house at all, but I can't pay more than one dollar a week for the
labor; therefore I don't want my husband and myself troubled with
him at night. I have five children, two of them are boys. I can only
give you board wages, and you can fix your own terms. As you are a
married man, I shall expect you to make your own arrangements with
respect to the hours you will work; but you can't expect to make any
profit. I have a good, neat house and I want you to give it every
attention, and let the work look tidy. There is no danger in sending
my washing here. I live on the third floor, so I want you to come in
by the back way and make as little noise as possible, and don't
disturb my husband. There is a house painter, who does the work
himself, and I can't spare him to do it here. So be careful in doing
my wash, and return my washing clean and white. If you can find
anything in the house you want to save, please take it. I have seven
or eight shirts--all made by one person, whom I don't want to lose.
But don't take them if you want to do washing. Please make the
arrangement as soon as you can, so that we can settle up matters. I
will be glad to know that you come.

'Yours truly,
   'S. C. E----.'

A lady writes to her daughter in Kansas, to request that she might
be invited to a birthday party.

'My dearest Sister:--Please remember my birthday, which comes on
Monday, the 5th, next. If we are all well in body and mind, the time
will be a happy one, and I am thankful that I am in this sweet and
healthy land. I cannot take your present home, for my husband will
not hear of it; but I would like you to consider that when you make
it up. Do not let me be forgotten, when you are able to make me a
little remembrance. I have been wanting to write to you and to tell
you what a good time I had last Wednesday night. We have a pleasant
little party once a month, for the purpose of having some of the
best we can get, and we all put our hearts into it, and talk
pleasant things; but our dinner is always simple, and I have a sweet
chicken soup, made by Mrs. C. W., and always get so hungry that I
eat heartily. The company are men and women from Kansas City, and
over the Missouri river; so I expect all the good things will come
to me. It is very pleasant, all our friends coming together to talk
over our business. Mrs. L. W. R., Mr. C. C. W., and Mrs. P. J. R.,
and my husband's friend, Mr. C., came to dinner to-day. They all
left the table before I had finished my dinner, and they said you
were to come down to me before supper to-night. You may know by this
you will be invited. So don't think I am so foolish as to be
annoyed if I do not see you, if you think better of it. And all that
I ask of you is not to let this be forgotten. We have a little choir
at the church, and I have a voice, and you are very musical, so I
should like to have you with us. Now remember me to all my little
friends; but don't forget to return this letter as soon as you can.
And I am expecting your husband, and would like to see him. So don't
forget. My love to him; and don't call him Uncle! for, in truth,
he is my first cousin, so I really do not need to feel so near. How
lucky for you that there is no one you can claim! And I do so want
you to be satisfied, but I shall not be content to let you stay
without the love of your friends.'

This same lady writes in another letter:--

'I send you some seeds from my garden, and a little pamphlet which
will tell you how to manage your house and work, and how to get up a
large article of furniture or house-linen. I am sorry to have you
have all the expense of your journey, but had rather send you the
book to read in the cars. You say you wish me to try and buy a good
machine for you. You must send me the make of the one you have. If
you have bought a machine lately, and never used it, write me how to
manage.

'I should have answered you long ago, but the children have been
sick, and I have been helping about their beds. They are now well. I
expect all will have a good day</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:50
