• This article was amended on 13 March 2016. An earlier version described a “migrant’s daughter” who had suffered long-term mental health problems after being raped and raped again by traffickers in Calais. We were wrong to do so, the Guardian would like to clarify, as the Guardian understands the woman is not a migrant and does not have French citizenship. The article has been updated to reflect this. The Guardian regrets any distress caused to the woman or others in her situation.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:02
