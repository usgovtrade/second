everything. I am sorry I lied to you but we do have to be careful with the 
money situation! 

I need to come to the city this weekend so, when I get your schedule can 
you e-mail it to me?

I heard back from school financial aid and appllication deadline is January 
7th! I guess you are appllied and I am not because of my dad. It is 
obviously not my fault.

I have found a few summer jobs. I will e-mail you the info. Keep in mind, 
this does not include a job for mom! Ha! Ha! I am going to work just so we 
can have money to move in to the city when you get here. What do you think? 

Well, I love you and I will talk to you on Sunday! 

Love always, Your Daughter in-law-to-be!
Melissa
