"I don't really care about that right now." "We have something very important to talk about, Mr. Castle." " Where is she?" " I don't know." "Not my job to track her down." " What about her phone?" " I don't know, either." "I swear, the last time I saw her she was at school, but I didn't talk to her." "I swear." "Wait, what school?" "Where?" "What's the name of the school?" "Wellesley." " Wellesley?" " Yeah." "Wellesley, here in New York?" "Where is that?" "What city?" "What state?" "What..." "Wellesley is just all over the place." "I don't know where it is." "All I know is that it's in New York." "Do you want me to call the police?" " No!" " No!" "No police." "You said you're the Kingpin." "Yes, I am." "I'm calling them right now." " Let's go." " What?" "Wait, wait." "Look, Mr. Reese." "I don't want you to do that, okay?" "You said you'd protect her." "So just let me call them." "Look, I'll call them right now." "This is the only way." " You have to trust me." " I don't." "Mr. Castle, she's my only family." "Look, I know you're going to do the right thing, the decent thing." "So let me do it." "Please." " All right." "What's the school called?" " I don't know." "I'm on it." "Garrison Prep, it's a prep school." "Thanks." " What?" " I'm sorry." "Nothing." "I just..." " You know, it's just you've been through a lot." " I mean, losing your partner like that." "Yeah, you didn't do it on purpose, did you?" "I just don't want you to feel like you're alone." "I'm not alone." "I have you." "Thanks, partner." "Yes." "It's the private school with the beautiful grounds." "They'll have to be somewhere in the city." "Garrison Prep, it's a prep school, right?" "Right." "Thanks." "NYPD, don't move!" "NYPD!" "Police!" "Move!" "Move!" " Get off me, man!" " Get off me, man!" "Get off me, man!" "You are a bunch of cowards!" "Let me go!" " Get off me!" " Please, be cool, sir." "This is my partner." "Sir, I am with them." "Yeah, this is my partner, Officer Reese." "NYPD, open the door!" "NYPD, open up, please!" "This is my partner, Officer Reese." "Open up!" "Let me in!" "Yeah, why don't you open it?" "Oh, I am opening it." "Open it!" "NYPD." "Open the door." "Okay, yes." "Yes, you are the police." "Officer Reese." "Officer Reese, you're a disgrace to the uniform." "What the hell are you doing here?" "What am I doing here?" "What the hell are you doing?" "I'm doing my job, Castle." "This is what we do." "Yeah, I can see that." "Not exactly what we were expecting." " Yeah, I'm sorry about that." " We got a tip about a drug-dealing ring running out of here." "So what's going on in here?" "They got this room locked off from the rest of the building." "These guys are using the shower as a meth lab." "Just getting high on our time." "You guys are wasting our time." "Is that true, young man?" "What was that?" "Did you get high in there?" "No." "Don't you say another word, Castle." "Don't you say another word." "He's telling the truth." "Oh, really?" "Now that we got your attention, what are we gonna do about that?" "How are we gonna prove that, huh?" "We already searched the room and the bathroom and didn't find anything." "The room, not the bathroom." "You need to be smarter than that, Detective." "There are some very dangerous things happening in the bathroom, not to mention the fact that... that we haven't found anything in the room." "Hey, did you take a look at this?" "Those guys have been in there for two hours." "No, there was no one in there when I got here." "Then they must be hiding in the bedroom." "Wait a minute, they're not answering." "This is not good." "I would say don't move, but you know that." "Are you sure you didn't leave the lights on?" "No, I'm sure." "I turned them off when we left." "I'm pretty sure." "Maybe you should check." "All right, I'm gonna go check on them." "You stay with these people." "You don't want to go into that room." "Come on, let's go." "Are you sure you left the lights off?" " Yes, sir." " Well, why do I feel like I'm lying to you?" "Maybe the light's just burned out or something." "We've been down here for two hours." "We haven't seen a soul come down here once, not a soul." "You better hope they don't hear you leaving that bathroom." "Okay, guys, we're going in." "No!" "You can't!" "We gotta find the lights." " You're not going in there." " How are we gonna get a warrant for a locked room?" "I don't know." "We'll figure it out, okay?" "Let's get in there." "Hello?" "Yo, I think someone's in here!" "Come on." "Whoa!" "He's so damn weird." "We're here for a couple of drug dealers." "No one else here." "We'll be out of here as soon as the cops get here." "Who the hell is that?" "Oh, my God, Castle, what happened to you?" "Castle?" " Oh, my God, what happened to your face?" " Castle!" "Are you okay?" " Yes, yes, I'm okay, I'm okay." " Look, um..." "I was walking around the locker room looking for something to clean out this cut on my head, and I just found something a little strange." "A little strange?" "What do you mean, a little strange?" "I was cleaning out this old cut when I found some of this... some of this blue paint." "Look at the size of the cut." "It's about the size of a half dollar." "That's not paint, Castle, that's ink." "That was not there before." "Okay, so we're going down there now." "No, no, no, no, no, no." "Wait, wait." "Wait, wait, wait." "Wait, wait, wait, wait." "Let me get this straight." "Okay, the four guys that came up with that plan to rob us, they were wearing masks, and they took off with, like, $400,000 in cash." "Yeah, if you can call it that." "And you're saying they were in here two hours ago?" "Yeah, about." "And you think they came back and re-stashed that cash?" "Probably." "But that doesn't make any sense." "This is so dark and dank and creepy." "I don't even want to know what's in there." "This is where they kept the money?" "Well, it's a place to hide the cash, Castle, you know?" "Yeah, well, what would you keep cash in a place like this for?" "Why didn't they just put it in the bank?" "Did you hear that?" "Yeah." "I bet it's just one of those rats that scurries up your leg at night and nestles into your ear." "Yeah." "Wait a minute." "Maybe it's not a rat at all." "No, come on." "No." "Oh, no." "It's too late." "What are you doing?" "Oh, God!" "What is that?" "Is that a head?" "Yes, it is." "And a head that's been in here for two hours... that means it's been dead for two hours." "That's impossible." "There's no way we're gonna get an autopsy out here in two hours." "We're gonna need a body." "This is messed up." "Yeah." "Hey, Beckett, I've got something here, looks like a... a bullet hole." "And blood." "Yeah, looks like someone shot right through that thing." "I'm getting excited now." "No." "There's more." "Come on." "Keep going." "Do you see anything?" "Uh, I don't know." "Are those... legs?" "Okay, they're human legs." "Oh, God!" "It's like some kind of freaking... horror show in here." "What is that?" "What the hell was that?"</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:01
