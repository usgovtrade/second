How do I disable auto-compression?

I'm playing Call of Juarez: The Cartel, and I have to reconnect every two hours or my connection gets interrupted. 
Why?
From the in-game console: 
(13:10:15) [Call of Juarez: The Cartel] ~~> "Auto-Compression is enabled."
(13:10:15) [Call of Juarez: The Cartel] ~~> "Force Compression OFF."
(13:10:15) [Call of Juarez: The Cartel] ~~> "Auto-Compression is now off."

I think that I have to change the following configuration but I cannot find where this is located. Can someone please point me in the right direction? 

A:

You have to change the following console settings, which you can easily locate by simply typing ~ ~ C ~ ~, and then use arrow keys to navigate the list and press Enter to select an option.
Here are a few examples that disable the Auto-Compression:
~ ~ C ~ ~ Auto-Compression
 ~ ~ C ~ ~ Auto-Compression Toggled
~ ~ C ~ ~ Auto-Compression Compression Force
~ ~ C ~ ~ Disable Compression On Demand
~ ~ C ~ ~ Disable Auto-Compression

Auto-Compression is disabled when you change the last one. You can then proceed to the next problem in your OP: "I think that I have to change the following configuration but I cannot find where this is located.".

A:

It is likely that you have enabled compression in the Internet Options:

Tools → Options → Advanced
In the Connection section, select the appropriate option:
  I only want to use a connection that offers the best performance and my computer will contact the Internet when a connection is needed. I want to use a dial-up connection to the Internet that connects at startup and only periodically checks for a dial-up modem.

or

I will use a broadband connection with a router that can provide a dial-up connection.

If the option Auto-Compression is enabled in the Advanced tab, disable it in Options → Advanced. You may also have to make the same change in the Advanced tab for the Connection window of your Internet connection.
You can test whether Auto-Compression is enabled by opening a command prompt and entering ipconfig /all. If it shows two lines with IcmpTypes and Compression and the last one is 1, Auto-Compression is enabled.

A:

Auto-Compression is enabled by the Compression setting under advanced for the internet options of the settings tab. Go to Internet options and then change that value to disabled. 
Compression
Indicates whether the computer is set to compress network traffic.

Disabled (the default)
The computer does not compress data.

Enabled
The computer compresses data. This option is available only if you have installed the Windows® Vista Networking Pack, also known as the TCP/IP Helper service. This feature is designed to make it easier to maintain low-speed dial-up connections by compressing data being sent over a dial-up connection, such as the one provided by a 56K modem, to improve the bandwidth.

Important Note: To change this value, you must turn off Automatic Updates and then restart your computer.

When the network driver is in Auto-Config mode, the Compression setting is always disabled. To enable compression, see Compress Data Sent and Received over a Network.

To change the value for other computers on your network that are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, follow these steps:

If you have the Windows Vista Networking Pack installed on your computer, follow these steps to change the value for Compression:

Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
Click Network and Internet, and then click Internet options.
Click the Advanced tab.
Click Compression in the list, click Enabled, and then click OK.

If you do not have the Windows Vista Networking Pack installed on your computer, follow these steps to change the value for Compression:

Click Start, and then point to Settings.
Click Control Panel.
Click Network and Internet, and then click Internet options.
Click the Advanced tab.
Click Compression in the list, and then click Disabled.
Click OK.
