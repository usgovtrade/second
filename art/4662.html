"I'm sure he's going to come up with something." "He has a very long and hate-filled history, doesn't he?" "We've been the object of his hatred and contempt for nearly two years now." "All right, let's get him in here." "Oh, I'll be right back." "This is really good coffee." "You're a great cook." "Well, I am pleased to be of service, sir." "I want you to meet someone." "Yeah." "Let's go." "I have some news." "Well, actually, I have some good news and some bad news." "My name is..." "Mulder." "Fox Mulder." "This is my associate, Dana Scully." "We're with the FBI." "Oh, God, this is worse than I thought." "Mulder and Scully are here investigating the murder of your daughter and your granddaughter." "What?" "Wha..." "How did..." "They found your old military uniform out in your driveway." "We think you're the one who's wearing it." "Wait, let me..." "Get out of here!" "He didn't kill those people." "He's got emotional problems, a military history." "He fits the profile." "This is a mistake." "I'm telling you, he's not the man you want." "I'm telling you, you're wasting your time." "He's a murderer!" "You can't just bring him in here!" "Mulder, you've got to stop!" "We got this all wrong!" "You do not have a killer!" "He's not the killer!" "Are you okay?" "I'm okay." "You're Scully." "Yeah." "I just don't understand why you didn't tell me who you were." "Why didn't you tell me?" "Why don't you want anyone to know you're here?" "I just can't go to work knowing my life is in danger." "I can't go back to my apartment knowing I'm being followed." "You've been through enough, okay?" "You just..." "Just got out of a psychiatric hospital." "I have been through hell." "You know that." "I don't want to go back there." "We have some self-defense classes at the office we can put you in." "But I can't go back there." "What am I going to do when I get to work?" "What if I'm not there when he shows up?" "If you need help, we can get you some 24-hour protection." "We can put you in a safe house." "My ex-husband lives here in D.C." "I couldn't stand to be in the same place." "Mulder, you don't need to be worried about him." "I'm worried about you." "He's been calling me." "He knows I'm here." "He's called the police." "They're going to bust you." "You said you were having a party." "Yeah, that's what I told him." "We got any coffee brewing?" "Yeah, there's a pot in the freezer." "Thanks." "Come on, Mulder." "This has gone on long enough." "Are you telling me there's nothing you can do?" "No." "I can't prove it, but I'm telling you there's not a killer on the loose." "And if that's the truth, then whoever's doing this has nothing to fear." "You said it yourself, Mulder, this man believes in his act." "He's as addicted to the attention as he is to the killing." "He has no compunction about killing anyone who threatens that." "You heard what the old man said." "He is a military man." "We trained him." "Look at the way he dresses, for Christ's sakes." "He has a gun." "I mean, what is it you think he's afraid of?" "That I'll find him?" "I can't catch him, so he wants to kill himself?" "No." "That's not how this man works." "He's an executioner, not a suicide." "What if he thinks he is one of them?" "What if this has nothing to do with the men who died?" "What if he's really not here to kill us?" "We're not doing this." "This man is a killer, and he's coming after us." "I want to be left alone." "Listen, Mulder, I have to go out of town for a couple of days." "What are you doing?" "I'm going through my mail." "What?" "My mail." "Agent Mulder, this is Dr. Patterson." "I'm calling to warn you that there's a patient in your building claiming to be your ex-colleague." "What's his name?" "His name is Krycek, Nicolae Krycek." "I'm on my way." "There's no one in here!" "What's going on?" "The man in the apartment across the hall said he didn't know him." "What was he doing in there?" "Where's Scully?" "She's in there with Krycek." "Are you all right?" "What the hell is going on?" "We were supposed to meet this guy here." "He was standing in our apartment when I came home." "What guy?" "He was just standing here, talking on your phone." "You didn't see him?" "I didn't see anybody." "How long have you been here?" "Less than a minute." "Where did you go?" "You saw someone standing here, and then what?" "Then I came inside and we got on the phone." "He wanted to meet here." "He said that he'd been following you." "And what did he want?" "He didn't say." "Mulder, what are you doing?" "Mulder, what's going on?" "We're working with you on this." "But I can't help you if you run from the truth." "You're saying that there's nothing wrong with me." "With you." "You're not in good shape." "I'm not in the shape I was in." "Have you been taking your medication?" "Yeah, I've been taking it." "I was on a plane, right?" "You and I were in Chicago, and I was shot." "Now, this whole thing..." "We're in a hospital." "Some orderly's come through here and shot you." "This all feels very real." "But it's not real." "But it's real to me." "It's not real to you." "It's not real to you because it's not happening right now." "And you think that you're the only person in the world that can know what's real?" "I can try." "I can't know what's real." "Maybe you could." "Maybe that's what I'm trying to tell you." "Can you help me?" "I'm trying to help you." "I can't help you from in here." "And I can't help you if you don't believe that I'm trying to help you." "I need more time." "I need you to help me figure out what the hell this is." "You have to trust me, Mulder." "I do trust you." "I just need you to believe in me." "You have to believe in me." "I want to believe in you, but this is..." "This is crazy stuff." "Where's Scully?" "She left a few minutes ago." "Where did she go?" "She went to make a phone call." "It was personal." "What do you mean, she went to make a phone call?" "Where are you going?" "They say the next hour's critical." "I don't think you understand the risk you're taking." "No, I understand completely." "Then I want to go over your head." "You can't go over my head." "You're going to use that?" "I was thinking of shooting you." "Then how would we explain it?" "You ever hear the expression," ""arriving just in the nick of time"?" "I need you to leave that here with me." "Are you aware you just told me that you were thinking of shooting me?" "Please put it down." "I'm trying to protect you." "Mulder, he knows about your sister, the baby." "Is this the man that killed your sister?" "No." "He has the same problem, though." "He's in agony." "He can't let go of his life." "I'm not going to let you use this on him." "You are going to leave here with this." "It's okay, Mulder." "I forgive you." "Scully!" "Scully!" "Scully!" "Scully!" "Scully!" "Mulder, get in here!" "Help me!" "It's okay." "I didn't see anyone." "How do you know it's the orderly that attacked us?" "Mulder." "Don't let him get in the room!" "You don't understand." "Get a picture of him." "I need a picture of him!" "It's him!" "It's the orderly</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:02
