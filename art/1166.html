This video, and in particular the song “I Need A Dollar”, is a creative commons license work by Choo Choo Boogie, who kindly gave me permission to use it in this video.
The lyrics are:
Sometimes I need a dollar
to get by.
Sometimes I need a dollar
Just to buy my pride.
Sometimes I need a dollar
when I feel like crying.
When I need a dollar
to make it through the day.
Sometimes I need a dollar
to get by.
Sometimes I need a dollar
Just to get from town.
Yeah, sometimes I need a dollar
When I get down and feel like walking out the door.
And that’s the time I need a dollar
when I think I’ll lose my way.
So if you wanna give me just a dollar
and help me make it through another day
I thank you, I’ll be glad to take it.
I thank you, I’ll be glad to take it.
To walk on down the street
I thank you, I’ll be glad to take it.
I need a dollar
When I get down and feel like walking out the door.
(when I get down and feel like walking out the door).
I need a dollar, when I get down and feel like walking out the door.
Oh yeah, sometimes I need a dollar
When I feel like crying.
When I need a dollar, just to get from town.
Sometimes I need a dollar, when I get down and feel like walking out the door.

This plan is great because it doesn't require you to worry about when the person you're trying to reach gets home or even when you'll be home yourself. All your calls will go through at the same time no matter when you call. Also, calls on the plan are always to landlines, which is much less expensive than international or mobile calls! This plan also has an option that allows you to get unlimited calling to 20 countries for an additional $5/month and you can talk as much as you want in those 20 countries for $0.10 per minute. You can also talk on your phone for free on a Wi-Fi connection using your tablet, laptop, or mobile device (when it's connected).
