If I'm not mistaken, this site is an Amazon affiliate?

This is also useful for recovering password from other data than the source
blog that you have hacked.

An Amazon affiliate website is not needed to explain this.

This has nothing to do with wordpress passwords.

A comment pointing that out would have been better than deleting the post.

You didn't even understand the link...

EDIT: And for any others that might read this post, yes, this is a
WordPress/Wordpress.com related question, whether or not that was known.

~~~
mooism2
I understood the link perfectly, thank you.

~~~
pokoleo
I did that so that others will also understand the link. But, the title on HN
should've been improved.

~~~
mooism2
I understand why you submitted it, and why I agreed with your reason for doing
so.

I disagree that the title should have been changed. People are more likely to
click on a link that says "How to hack wordpress passwords" than one that says
"Wordpress.com passwords are easy to hack".

There's no question what this link is about. It could be the title.

"Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or
exclamation points, or adding a parenthetical remark saying how great an
article is. It's implicit in submitting something that you think it's
important."

pokoleo
The title could be improved upon; it's not as common knowledge as most think.

pjscott
This is something many people don't know, because it's not very well known.

~~~
pokoleo
The best thing to do is to correct the title... not delete the post.

~~~
pjscott
It got changed.

~~~
pokoleo
I'm glad it got changed. Now let's see some of us HN members correct the title
of this post...

~~~
pjscott
I'm all for that. The point of the guideline you're trying to make is sound
enough; it doesn't need to be applied in every case.

This comment has been heavily flagged.

This was not meant to be so controversial, but the title has been changed and
I'm not going to fight that.
