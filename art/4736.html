Souls on Ice: The Story of Terri Schiavo is a book published in 2000 by Jerome Armstrong, M.D., and Barbara Klinefelter. It relates the case of Terri Schiavo. Armstrong is the executive director of the Pro-Life Union of Greater Philadelphia. The book also includes a foreword by Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network.

Reception
Richard Posner criticized the book, saying that "The evidence presented in [Armstrong's] book is so selective that one can get the impression that she wrote it to provide a pretext for judicial intervention in the Schiavo case—as, indeed, subsequent developments have shown."

In his book review for The Boston Globe, Thomas C. Leonard described Souls on Ice as "the definitive account" of the Terri Schiavo case and its "tragic denouement." Mark D. Adams wrote that the book "[d]elivered the coup de grace to [the Schiavo case]," and that the account of the case, "if not factually correct, is certainly not untruthful, as most of its assertions are easily verifiable."

Souls on Ice has received very favorable reviews by the editorial board of Christianity Today, Michael Ledeen of the New York Sun, and The New York Times''' Michiko Kakutani, who called the book "a disturbing chronicle of a case that was, by turns, hysterical and cruel, but also of a medical system that came to resemble an execution squad."
