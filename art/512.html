. 
You will never see your husband/wife/fiancee/fiance/dog/cat/kid again if you are in
rehab. 
Your "feminine flower" will never get back together again and your womanhood
and 
femininity will always be in question and can only be judged by how you look.

I could go on, but as you are reading this email it means you don't care and are 
trying to justify what is "really" going on.

I am in CANADA my man is in DENMARK.   He knows what is happening to me and 
if it
doesn't stop, he will fly to Vancouver (he did tell me to get help after our last

fight which I'm sure you have no clue about).  If you don't care I can understand
why you wouldn't contact me to help.

Good Luck on your vacation and let's catch up when you return.
I love you, even though I really know you don't love me back.

Kari

Cindi,

What a wonderful family that was so selfless and great to everyone that
needed help.  I have a lot of respect for that family, I can only imagine how
hard it is to have a child that gets in these kind of situations.  Its like
being raised for years on how to be selfless and giving, and then having to
turn the role around and become a parent.  When you see it in the media, you
do get sucked in and don't realize how bad it is.

It was great to see that show that showed the reality of what goes on in the
rehab's. 
You cannot really get the full story without seeing it on the TV.

"Dare to be different"
"Ain't no rules here but to be honest and respect others point of view, have
fun and don't bother me when Im trying to get by in my own little world."

This is really all about, and for women that have decided to start living
their life on their own terms, whatever that means. 
"I'm sick of the world telling me what I should and shouldn't do, and what I
should and shouldn't look like. 
I live my life how I want to and because it feels right, because it makes me
happy and because it takes courage to be different."

"I dare to be different" 
"Ain't no rules here but to be honest and respect others point of view, have
fun and don't bother me when Im trying to get by in my own little world."

To be different is hard at first. You will be the only one standing alone in
your thoughts. Other women will either pass you by or just laugh at you for
being different. So don't be ashamed that you don't look like some model and
live a life of a 9 to 5 job. But keep in mind you need to learn what it takes
to balance all your roles, or you will be stuck</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:39
