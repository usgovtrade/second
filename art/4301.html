Terence Farrell (13 February 1924 – 15 March 1997) was an Irish television director, journalist and writer.

Early life
Born in Dublin, Ireland, he went to The Royal Irish Academy of Music. His father was a doctor, born in Westmeath and worked in Dublin. His mother was from County Clare, and they married in Dublin. He was born at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin. He later lived in the southside of the city.

Journalism and early career
He was an assistant editor with the Irish Press newspaper in the early 1950s.  He wrote a number of travel books which were published by the Irish Times and several other publications.  He also wrote for a number of Irish newspapers including the Irish Examiner. In 1947 he was an assistant director with the BBC.  He also joined RTÉ in 1947 as a general assistant to Seán Ó Ceallaigh.  Together they made Irish-language programmes, including a number of Irish-language radio broadcasts and a number of early television programmes. During his time with RTÉ he assisted with the making of a few English-language programmes such as The Big House.

Film and television
He retired from RTÉ in 1950, where he had worked as a producer, director and writer. He was involved with RTÉ's television production of An Rí, the legendary series about the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the War of Independence. For RTÉ he also produced plays such as On Baile's Strand (1954) and The Playboy of the Western World (1958), the latter for the Dublin Theatre Festival. In 1962 he was involved in the production of Eire Dall (Ireland Forever).

He later became assistant editor with the Irish Times newspaper. He later went to BBC TV's headquarters in London as assistant editor. In 1967 he became involved in the BBC TV drama programme, Armchair Theatre. He returned to London in 1971 and joined BBC's TV Drama programme and subsequently worked in the United States. He was involved in Armchair Theatre as a series director. He was also involved with Crimewatch as a series director for one year.

He wrote TV guides for the Guardian newspaper, which was later published by Robert Hale.

He wrote and directed four plays in 1975 at Abbey Theatre, Dublin. He also wrote two television series, one about the life of Lord Acton and the other about Edward VII. He worked with RTÉ again on documentaries, and Irish-language broadcasts. He went to the United States and worked there with CBS TV, on documentaries about the United States, the first programmes dealing with Northern Ireland, and a docudrama about the Russian Revolution.

Death
Farrell died in 1997 in Dublin after a long illness. He died at St Vincent's Hospital.

Films
He worked on the English-language film The Hill (1968), written by Roddy Doyle, but a number of elements in the story were Irish, such as a character named Dinny.

Farrell wrote and directed his first movie, a short piece in America called The White Stag (1967), followed by the English film A Doll's House (1972). These were made for RTÉ with the assistance of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) in the period up to the 1970s. He went on to work for other producers, and worked in several other countries including France and the United States. He also was involved in the production of more than 20 feature films and teleplays. He worked with John Huston in the early 1990s and in France.

Writing
He published three books. The Last of The English and The Irish Rebellion (both 1974). He also wrote a number of plays, most notably, two plays directed by Pat Murphy, The Last Englishman (1955) and An Irish Confessions, Part 1 (1988), and the latter was televised by RTÉ.
