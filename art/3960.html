A small piece of that is my story here, another piece is that of some of the other writers here (for whatever reason), who despite having less than 10 posts, are already contributing to the discussion.

A quick look around here indicates that other than a few exceptions, the same applies to everyone in this thread.

All of us have a very long history with the subject of the thread, or with some other aspect of it.

So, in the end, if I've got a few more posts than most here, it's nothing more than a small portion of something much bigger.

Brett's story is one that should be added to the discussion here, because it shows us how important this subject is.

To all those who dismiss him for reasons like his lack of education, for being a "nobody", remember that by some measures he's in a whole lot of company.

"To this I add my sincere thanks for all the great feedback I received on the blog. For this to work as it should, you and all the readers should feel free to come and post or comment any time, so no need to hesitate to write again."

"What you think about what I wrote, what you want to know more about, it matters not a bit. What matters is that you can be sure I'm having my say. I am alive and there, with all my opinions and beliefs and it would be the greatest pity the world if the rest of us just didn't show up in the conversation. So come on, we're waiting."

Brett Gundlock: "That's an amazing letter. We in a large part of humanity live with that mindset, from your perspective. What you said about people who can't think, though, is very much how I feel about the way I sometimes perceive my own limitations. I should be able to just do everything in my life and in my own worldview, but if I get that part of me involved, especially if it's something else than the one to which I've been socialized, then I can't get anything done, all the time, even if I really, really want to."

I've had some experience with this. I am one who can do everything but write (or write well), and I was recently fired from a teaching position (after years of teaching for small children in public school). As a result of not "not doing a good enough job" at my "specialty", I took a very good gig with another school district. But, it turns out, it was to teach high school seniors, which isn't that easy to do for someone who is just a bit too old for that level of education. (I've taught elementary and secondary school classes since I started teaching around 2000.) I have been able to pick myself up and go from there, but, that is also in part because of the help of the wonderful people I worked with at the "old" school district.

I'm not writing this to get into that story because I'm not really writing about writing (although that's what I'm writing), but I want to mention that I wrote at least one post about my former students. I believe in writing about my life, especially when the life doesn't fit within the framework of someone else's socialization.

Thanks again for all your support and work,

Brett

[And, BTW, here's a link to the blog post you mentioned: http://www.teachertoolbox.org/blog/2012/02/an-interview-with-brett-gundlock/]

And a link to a letter that speaks for itself:

"What about all the non-specialized people that are doing their best? As far as I'm concerned they are the ones who really make things happen. I find in general (not always but often) that the more of a specialist you are, the more difficult it is to understand your subject matter and the broader your outlook is to that subject matter. "

and a note to all those whose opinion of me may have been affected by some remarks I made in that article:

"This isn't about what someone can do. It's about a personal responsibility to choose to do your best, regardless of what someone says. "

From above: "I haven't said he shouldn't write. Only that the people who are so outraged by his efforts to think that he deserves a punishment from a professional association should do some thinking about their own responsibility as a member of that association."

As one who has been trying to do that for most of my life, I could hardly disagree more. What's the point of being a member of a guild, a union, or whatever, if you feel no responsibility to contribute anything to the community as a whole? Is this an attempt at a double standard? Or, as several people have stated in this thread, have you forgotten the "art" or "science" of writing? The art of writing is, primarily, about communication. So, in the end, where does one draw the line between what can be said and what shouldn't be said? Isn't it a small enough leap to reach the conclusion that, if a child cannot think, then he or she should not be allowed to say anything that anyone would find disagreeable (at least in the public schools)?

Brett wrote that people should "do some thinking" about their own responsibility as a member of a guild, for example. Well, think about what your responsibility is as a member of any society. And before anyone starts throwing their two-bit "what's the point of it all?" opinion out there, please allow me to point out the obvious: I can't simply do it all, or do anything, but I can try to communicate the things I think need to be said. If that is "all I'm doing", then I'd say it is more than enough. If that is not "all I'm doing", then I am not the first or only one to have been accused of "going off the deep end" with the way I think, behave, and communicate. So what's so wrong with thinking and acting a little differently from the vast majority of people? Is it because they'll disagree with what I've said? I actually think I've said that I can't control who will think what, but that's a whole different discussion.

If a child cannot think, then he or she should not be allowed to say anything that anyone would find disagreeable (at least in the public schools).

That may be the case, but if I were ever presented with that situation, I'd resign my position. But then again, you're assuming that your standards will remain what they are and not change.
