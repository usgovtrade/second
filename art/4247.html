A few years ago I read this article on The Salt, and it inspired me to eat more soups. I would love to eat soup more often, but we tend to eat soup on nights that we eat out, because I love a good chicken noodle soup. There are countless recipes and variations of the idea, but […]

If you haven’t heard, I’m living on a very low carb diet. I started at a high level of low carb, and now my main diet is about 20-25 carbs per day. I like to think of myself as carb-loving. I love pasta and bread, and I eat vegetables often. When I first starting low-carbing […]

I thought I had a pretty good routine down to make the most of a night shift. I have been working every other day, 3-11 pm, for about 8 years. I start a shift, work until about 10:30, eat breakfast, then go back to work. By lunch time, it is almost impossible […]

I love the “fall back” recipes. I have found that when I put my mind to a new dish, and get it figured out, I feel accomplished and happy. And it is a great feeling to take my leftovers to work and have a great leftover meal. The leftover from this dish was […]

Here is a new twist on one of my favorite dishes, the tomato pie. This is a great summer soup made in the oven. Tomato pie is perfect for feeding a crowd because it makes a ton, and you only have to prepare it once. When I have leftovers, I put it in a […]

I have been wanting to make meatballs forever. It seems like every restaurant I walk into has meatball specials. This is pretty much like the meatball specials we have at my restaurant. You get a nice crusty roll, marinara and meatballs. This is a delicious, one dish meal that comes together very quickly. […]

I have been looking for an easy summer recipe to use the cherries from my mom’s yard. I love cherries, and I love cherry pies, but I didn’t want a cherry pie that wouldn’t turn out. Cherry cobbler was the perfect solution. This was super easy to make, and the cobbler tasted wonderful. If you […]

Here is a recipe that is great for leftover rice. I cooked brown rice that I cooked for the weekend, and I used half of it for this recipe. I didn’t use one of my favorite ingredients, which is dried chiles. I decided I would add them when the recipe was done, but I […]

I love to use my crock pot in the summer because I can make soups and meals for my lunches or dinners. This is another recipe I made a few months ago that I have made several times. It is quick and easy, and I like the way the chicken and vegetables look. When […]

I like to cook on Saturdays when I have a half day. I always try to make something that can be eaten that night, and that isn’t a casserole. You can’t eat leftovers for lunch on Saturdays, so you have to be creative. This time, I decided to try a recipe that […]

This is a great recipe for using those leftover veggies. It is one of the best things you will have all summer. If you have a tomato plant, or other fresh veggies in your yard, then you will get lots of basil and this will be your breakfast, lunch or dinner. This is one of the […]

I use my crock pot a lot because I work at night. I made this for dinner and then decided it would be a great lunch too. I was making it while I was eating dinner. If you are having leftovers for lunch, this is a great breakfast, dinner or lunch. I […]

This is the perfect dish for spring when you can’t find any berries, but you would like to make a dish with berry flavor. This is a great dish to use cherries, blueberries, strawberries and even blackberries. You could even make this into a sauce that you could serve over ice cream for a […]

Here is a great recipe that is easy and delicious. When my friend who makes amazing food told me she was making this, I immediately bought a bunch of broccoli. I have made broccoli before, but this is a good recipe because you get to roast the broccoli while you make it. I did […]

I had my first experience with homemade vegetable stock, and it is hard to go back to store bought. It isn’t hard to make at all, but it does take a few hours. It is much quicker to make stock using a crockpot, but you have to keep the stock cold, which can […]

I have wanted to try this recipe for so long, but I always figured it would be complicated. I didn’t like the concept of chopping chicken for soup. I have tried many chicken soups, and most of them require chopping chicken or chicken parts. This soup has such great flavor and it is full of vegetables. I […]

There are days when I am really tired and my cooking falls flat. In a perfect world, the only thing I have to do is buy fresh veggies from the farmers market, then I make a nice stock, put some butter in a crock pot, and call it a day. That is how it […]

If you love asparagus, this is one of the best recipes you will ever make. It is quick and easy, and very satisfying. I have made asparagus in a hundred different ways, and this is a great one. If you want to eat healthy, and you want to eat a lot of it, then this […]

For all my years of cooking, I have never had a recipe that I have made more than once, but I love this pasta. Every time I make it, it comes out completely different. Sometimes it is great, other times the pasta is overcooked, or I think that it is undercooked. Either way, it is a […]

I do a lot of work from home, and that means I have to take work lunches with me. I use this chili as a filling for homemade wraps, or you can eat it for lunch on its own. This chili tastes better a day after it is made, so plan ahead if you have the […]</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:15
