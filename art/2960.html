The next stop for the band was to work with Disney/Pixar’s film studio, who were looking for a song to be played over the film at the end. They wanted something for the young audience (I guess we know how that song ended in the end)! After some soul-searching, “We Are Not Alone” was chosen. (We were, were we not?!?) The final track for the movie is now in theaters around the world and can be found on the official Pixar film site! It has been such an amazing experience to have a song appear in a movie of this caliber!

"We Are Not Alone" Ending Sequence:

The Music Video Re-Mix

The Official Soundtrack has been released to stores and I’m happy to say that it is sounding amazing! Including all the great new music I’ve heard, I felt it best to write about this exciting development and bring you the whole story! I'll let you know all about it as soon as I have a moment, but in the meantime here are two new songs for you:

About

The "You Got This" Program was designed to empower kids with disabilities to take control of their lives and make their dreams come true. It's open to any kids with a diagnosis of any condition/disability/illness. We are here to help the kids! Our motto is "We Got This!" for a reason! This group is open to new members but it's advised that you have experience with your particular diagnosis and/or disabilities.

Fundraising

All members are expected to raise their funds in a healthy and respectful manner. Fundraising and fund-raisers are encouraged but fundraising is not required. If you do wish to raise funds, we suggest a one-time and/or a seasonal party.

Fundraisers can be anything from a run to a walk, to a party with a movie or an art exhibit (or even baking and selling cupcakes!), to an online auction - the options are really endless! Just something that reflects your strengths and talents.

Remember: As much as we wish for all our members to get to experience everything we offer, unfortunately, there may be times when your family may need to dip into the savings fund for events and fun. Please feel free to take part in fundraising opportunities when needed.

*For our "You Got This" families, we highly recommend contacting the foundation that we work with, which provides support services and funding for the families who cannot get support or services due to financial limitations.

Our Goals

We will always do our best to provide all of the activities and experiences possible for our families. This is a great big world with endless opportunities. As always, your feedback is welcomed and appreciated, so please feel free to email us with any suggestions, comments or questions you have. Thank you so much!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:57
