Other guest vocalists on the album include Alana Levine and the band's lead singer from their first album and "We Never Had" on their second album, Kevin Bowe. The album was produced by Rob Watson and Paul Wright. The band also released a bonus EP called "We Never Had" EP featuring two new songs titled "Boomtown" and "No, We Don't." The band said that this EP was their contribution to The Vinyl Exchange where you can send in copies of your old albums, and in return, they will send you a new album in exchange.

The song, "My Name Is Not Johnny Tambourine" was used in a TV commercial promoting the release of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1.

"Hole in the Sun" (the first single from the album) was released to iTunes on July 25, 2010. They released their music video for this song on September 1, 2010, which was followed by a free concert on MTV.

The first single, "We Never Had", was released to iTunes on November 16, 2010. This song peaked at number 26 on the Canadian Hot 100, and they appeared on Canadian Idol to perform it live on December 11, 2010.

Their second single, "Gouge My Eyes Out", was released to iTunes on January 10, 2011. The band went on a Canadian tour in late January and February. They also released their own new EP, with a second single, "Johnny Glowa", and music videos for "Johnny Glowa" and "It's Not Like It's My Birthday."

In November 2011, they released a new single, "Hallelujah".

The band did a small acoustic tour in 2014 with their first two albums, as well as a tour with the New Pornographers to celebrate 10 years of their last album.
