Businesses are required to accurately collect their customer’s card information, and then store it in a secure manner, so that the customer is not billed for fraudulent charges. It is important to monitor that your staff is complying with these requirements.

How to verify a customer’s identity and ensure a secure, compliant environment

We’ll audit your practice to ensure that your staff is properly trained on the rules and regulations, and have the right policies and procedures in place.

Manual processes to identify and address the risks are outdated. Today’s automated technology can make it easier for you to comply with these requirements, monitor your staff’s compliance and take a proactive stance to combat fraud.

The security of your customers’ personal information is a hot topic.

To help your business protect your customers’ data, and avoid reputational and legal problems associated with being non-compliant, here are a few tips to help you protect your practice:

• Train your staff to handle credit card data in a secure manner

• Adhere to the rules and regulations of PCI DSS

• Be proactive in detecting and preventing fraud

• Be vigilant with staff training, review and monitoring.

We provide you with the training and support you need to meet your obligations.
