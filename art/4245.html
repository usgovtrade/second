Migraines can cause significant chronic pain and may be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. B12 deficiency, one of the more commonly overlooked issues, can cause severe headaches. As we age, our digestive enzymes become less effective, causing nutrient absorption to deteriorate. Our senses also become less sensitive and our metabolism becomes increasingly sluggish. To make matters worse, as we age, our bodies can start absorbing toxic minerals into our bloodstream and this can affect our nervous system. Migraines are more common in women and the reasons for this are not clear but one theory is that hormonal imbalances, which occur as we age, and are often unrecognized, may play a role in this.

Migraine causes and symptoms:

Migraines cause symptoms that can appear immediately (such as pain, visual disturbances, weakness, or dizziness) or may take several hours or days before the first noticeable symptoms appear. Symptoms of the migraine include severe pain, nausea and vomiting, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, extreme fatigue, and more. Women are five times more likely than men to develop migraines. Typically, migraines are located on one side of the head.

The symptoms of migraines are typically the same each time they occur but can become more or less severe over time and often change. It is not unusual for migraines to change from being mild to more severe, or vice versa. If a person has recurring migraines, these can become worse and there may be only a small amount of discomfort before the attack. The headache may also spread from one side of the head to the other side. For some, severe attacks can cause them to experience double vision, lose their sense of time, become dizzy or even lose consciousness. The severity and frequency of migraine attacks varies widely among patients, with some experiencing only one attack a year and others experiencing dozens or more. Typically, females have an increase in attacks from puberty into the menopause and then decrease during their childbearing years.

How migraines are diagnosed and treated:

Migraines may be diagnosed by a healthcare professional. Because many people may also have some pre-existing health conditions, diagnosis can sometimes take several appointments. A person’s physical exam and a review of their medical history are necessary for proper diagnosis. Because they are often recurrent, it is common for a patient to be asked to keep a daily diary of headache symptoms and the events that cause or bring on a headache, called a headache diary. In the diary, the patient lists the pattern of their symptoms, such as frequency, intensity and duration.

Treatment for migraines may include medications, physical therapy or behavioral therapy. In some cases, patients may be given lifestyle changes, such as stopping smoking, losing weight, avoiding stress and getting more rest. Research suggests that a change in diet may also help. Migraine triggers, as mentioned earlier, include food additives and preservatives, smoking, changes in hormone levels and hormonal changes during menopause. Food and drinks with caffeine, chocolate, aspartame and artificial sweeteners can bring on migraines. In fact, aspartame, commonly found in diet drinks and some medications, was known to cause migraine. Aspartame’s chemical formulation is identical to methyl alcohol and was found to create problems for many patients with the same biochemistry.

Women in their menopausal years often experience hormonal changes. When this happens, women often experience symptoms such as hot flashes, difficulty sleeping, irritability, headaches and other physical or emotional changes. Hot flashes occur in many women, especially around the time of menopause. Although they are usually mild and short-lived, sometimes they can be severe. Hot flashes can also be frightening and can be disruptive to daily life. Hot flashes are thought to result from changes in hormones. Hormone therapy for hot flashes usually involves estrogen, either alone or with progesterone.

Migraine medication:

In addition to lifestyle changes, medications can also be very helpful in managing migraines. Painkillers, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, can be effective for some people. Other medications used to treat migraines include the ergot derivative dihydroergotamine and triptans. These medications are often taken at home and can prevent migraines in some people. Unfortunately, they can also be associated with side effects, including stomach pain and dizziness.

There are also various supplements that may be useful in treating migraine. One such supplement is B12, which is recommended by the American College of Rheumatology to help manage migraines. Although it is typically taken at home, it can help manage migraines without causing stomach upset and is also readily available in most pharmacies and supermarkets.

Migraine triggers:

As we age, we may develop new sensitivities that will make some of the triggers listed above, especially sugar, salt and alcohol, more significant to us. In addition to food, migraine sufferers may find specific triggers, such as strong odors, bright lights and changes in room temperature. These are common migraine triggers because they are triggers for many people. In many cases, treating these triggers is all that is necessary for controlling the symptoms of migraines.

Ongoing monitoring:

Because the symptoms of migraines vary widely between individuals and in their severity, some people may need to work with a doctor to continue treatment. Ongoing monitoring is necessary because of the variable nature of the condition and the wide range of medications that can be helpful.

As part of the treatment for migraines, it is helpful to practice relaxation, especially for those who tend to be easily angered or stressed. Exercising and yoga can also help patients deal with stress and get better sleep. A change in diet may also help with many migraine sufferers and their problems. People should pay attention to what they eat and get rid of any foods that seem to trigger a migraine, and avoid eating too much food in a short time. By making small changes in their diets, most people can improve the effectiveness of their treatments and reduce migraines for good.
