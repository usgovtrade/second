If your system gets infected, but you did not click on any of the suspicious links or open malicious attachments, no data breach. Most cases are simple as that.

The second case is the Cryptoware cryptoattack. Cryptoware has a backdoor built-in. When the ransomware is activated, it checks the system for some of the installed programs that have certain strings in their names. If such strings are found, it will download the Cryptoware from a remote location, and run it to encrypt the data. In the unlikely event of an infection, the backdoor does not affect all of the files and folders, but only some of them.

How can your data be protected?

All three forms of ransomware can be prevented by implementing proactive information security measures. The most important thing to remember is to stay away from suspicious links, emails, and attachments. At the same time, you need to keep in mind the proper backup and restore process and have a reliable IT recovery partner in place. If you have questions or need help with any of these measures, feel free to contact us.

In addition to this kind of security protection, here are three other effective security measures you can apply in order to stay safe:

Educate your team. Not everyone knows what a backdoor is and what it is used for. It is important to educate your employees, especially those who work in the IT sector. If you have such an employee on your team, make sure they have at least basic information about cryptoware and how to prevent it from getting into your systems.

Maintain up-to-date antivirus. Your antivirus needs to be up-to-date and always up-to-date with the latest updates. In addition, keep in mind that antivirus programs need to be updated frequently and be the newest versions that are available. The more outdated the software you have in place, the higher the chances of it not working as you expect.

Apply an active data backup plan. Data backup is a way to recover your systems from a cyber attack, and is considered to be the number one way to protect your data. The longer you wait to implement a backup solution, the harder it will be for you to recover. If you have questions about the best IT recovery partner, feel free to contact us and we will assist you.

It is clear that cyber security breaches will continue to grow. The best defense is to know exactly what you need to do, what can be done, and what can not be done. If you want to know more about information security threats, contact us. We are happy to help you out with a consultation on what you can do to protect your business and customers.
