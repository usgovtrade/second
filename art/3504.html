For a while, Rin Tin Tin didn't get much attention. However, the series did feature one of the most memorable moments of them all, when the dog of the same name came in second place.

Rin Tin Tin helped his partner win a new truck by correctly identifying a prize hidden behind one of five boxes. After being chosen by a contestant, the prize would be given away to another person.

This video shows Rin Tin Tin's partner opening the box in the fourth round. What appears to be a model car is inside the box. The dog is correct. But in order to win the truck, he will have to help his partner win the car.

Rin Tin Tin won a new truck and a puppy for partner Lee. The game show's executive producer Mark Goodson told People that because they were so "stunned and delighted," by how well Rin Tin Tin did, they had no idea what the show was supposed to be all about. "I remember saying to myself, â€˜Why is this dog doing so well? This dog has no clue about the game!" he said.

"So many people didn't know how to talk about dogs, we didn't know how to talk about dogs, and yet, here is this dog that was not only able to do it, but he was able to talk to people and convince people. For us, that was so remarkable because it showed we could put the dog on television and it would go over like a rocket ship."

He added: "It's that dog. That dog is the best. That dog was fabulous."

A decade later, a game show with a dog that appeared as the biggest star was released, and the dog would win.

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

The iconic quiz show that ran from 1999 to 2008 featured the most hilarious appearance by a dog and his host, originally appearing as contestants.

The game was based on a British show called Who Dares Wins. Each round, a contestant was given the opportunity to answer $100,000,000 in prize money. He or she could, however, risk everything by choosing a puzzle in order to double the prize money.

In one of the first moments of the game, the host, Regis Philbin, talked to the dog. He explained how it worked and that the contestant can double his money up to $1,000,000. As the dog licked his hands, Philbin looked at the audience and said: "And I think you know what that means."

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire became one of the most popular TV shows of the '90s. The quiz show would run for 16 years.

When the quiz show first started, the rules were different. However, in 2003, the rules changed and contestants had to risk $5,000 instead. According to the show's creator, Raycom Media, the switch was made so that more people could win and become millionaires.

The producers of the show had some difficulties when it came to the dog. In 1999, the dog wasn't used during the first season of the show and only appeared in 2000. "You need to love the dog to understand how wonderful he is," Regis Philbin told The Daily Mail.

But that was not all. From the very beginning, the dog was not always an active participant in the game show. The dog usually stayed at the side of the host, although Philbin would sometimes let him come near and play with the contestants.

In one famous scene, Philbin's co-host Richard Chamberlain was in charge of interviewing a man from Florida. The audience was shocked when the dog, that was lying on the other side of the room, suddenly moved from its spot. It was as if the dog got a little jealous.

"I don't want to see you here," Philbin told the dog before telling the audience: "Please don't be upset with the dog. He wasn't supposed to be here. He doesn't know what's going on here, you understand that, don't you?"

However, the dog was one of the best guests in the show's history. "He was a little dog, but he was very popular with the viewers," Philbin told The Telegraph. "Every time we'd say hi, the kids would go crazy. It was really enjoyable."

The dog gained a huge number of fans and received the name Rin Tin Tin for his incredible skills on the show.

When it was finally time for the last episode of the game show in 2008, Rin Tin Tin announced that he was "going to retire" and left his partner, Philbin, with a hug.

The only person who seemed to be upset about the dog's decision was his owner. However, the dog's contract with the show only had two episodes left to go.

The dog continued to play a role in the world of entertainment until his owner put him to sleep in 2008, when he was only 8 years old. "He was really important and I loved him," Philbin told Sky News. "But he's a dog and you can't have a relationship with a dog that's longer than their life."

What made Rin Tin Tin so special? The answer is simpler than we think. "People love him," Philbin told The Telegraph. "They look at that dog and they just melt."
