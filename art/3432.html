I've never heard of TaaS before, and I'm not sure that I like the sound of
"hackable" stock photos...

You probably don't want to be an investor.

I agree that stock photography has been a mixed blessing for most folks that
have been there. In some ways, it's probably improved lives (at the expense of
folks on the other side). In some ways, it's contributed to real evils. In
some ways, it's improved those who paid for it. In some ways, it has helped
those who were paying to buy it. (It does help the companies that sell
it....)

I'm curious if you were using stock photography before it was free, or if you
think it should be priced at $$$ or if you think it should be free?

How much is this site actually contributing to improving the image/image
production industry? Can the image be easily and repeatedly reproduced on
similar sites, or does the license explicitly forbid this?

~~~
masonhensley
The photos will only show up once and disappear on the image-sites (like 500px)
once a day. This is only the first version of the process, so there are still
still a ton of other things to do/fix. We will have 100k+ images in the next
month.

~~~
stcredzero
_We will have 100k+ images in the next month._

Great!

andrewcooke
are you thinking of taking a commission from stock sites for each use? (ie
selling my photo twice?) or should i expect that you'll only use it once and
then send the image over to other people?

~~~
masonhensley
Currently, all photos stay with us.

If you do an upload, we will be emailing you to ask if you're ok to make that
image available for use in the library.

A lot of people create amazing images with no expectation of licensing. Many
people get frustrated that photos never get used, and some of the best images
never get seen. We're setting up a marketplace for the public to share their
photos, and that marketplace is open to all.

~~~
andrewcooke
it's not clear to me that the photos stay with you. if i upload, there are 2
options: i can "give" it to you (so you do not use it at all), or i can "sell"
it to you (you can use it). so i upload my photo, then i can chose one of two
options, neither of which seem to involve you.

i don't know if you mean to say "give" or "sell" there - so i'm not sure if
you've got it right or not.

~~~
masonhensley
You can sell the image once, and I agree, it's not clear. The main idea was to
keep the image available so it can be distributed with a license (a license is
free for the community).

I am going to be adding a lot more options that will allow you to use the
image at a price. Maybe that's what I meant.

thehodge
Hey guys, I see your site is only available in US.. What would it cost if I'm
based in London?

~~~
masonhensley
That is very important. We haven't solved that yet. We are currently focusing
on getting the community together and building out the system. We have
everything in place to make an incredible site, and just need to tie it all
together.

zecg
I had a similar idea to this years ago. How is the business model?

------
drumdance
I like the idea but I'd love to see free versions. My band is too poor to hire
a band photographer, and all the free stock photos are terrible.

~~~
masonhensley
Free versions are coming! We will also have some really cool ideas for
allowing free use. I'm going to be working with some huge publishers in the
next month to get some ideas for how to do this right.

~~~
drumdance
Excellent. I'll check back then :)

marcusbooster
Is the pricing based on # of images or on the number of hits?

~~~
masonhensley
The pricing is based on the number of images. The more you have, the more you
pay. Once your account passes a certain point, we pay you a royalty.

~~~
marcusbooster
Got it. So in other words, if you want all your images to be under $1, it'll
cost you an order of magnitude more.

~~~
masonhensley
Yep, but also, if you wanted to use the photos for free, you would have to
give up 100% of that value.

------
kirchhoff
Are all of the photos copyright free? If so, are they CC/FSA licensed?

~~~
masonhensley
The photos have a license that gives the public the right to use them as long
as they're not being used to market a company or person.

In the case of a copyright infringement, you agree to remove the photo as soon
as we are notified. We are not going to be the one being the bad guy, we will
just pull it.

So basically, the old "Pay $N for a full-resolution image that I can use any
way I want" ->
[http://images.google.com/images?q=free+photo+search+tool&sour...](http://images.google.com/images?q=free+photo+search+tool&sourceid=navclient-
ff&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) + CC/FSA license?

~~~
masonhensley
Yep! So many people had a hard time getting usable photos off of
stockphoto.com before, it was a bit painful and had trouble keeping up. We're
going to have so many images,</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:14
