Researchers at RMIT University in Australia developed the new material that can be used in 3D printing and construction. In fact, the team was able to 3D print a wall out of the cement, and then encase it in an acrylic skin. The skin allows the cement to be painted, just like building with more conventional cement. But the skin won't crack, expand, or shrink, and it can resist chemical and fungal deterioration. That's because the cement has embedded nano-sized slivers of graphene, which makes it stronger, more durable, and weather-resistant.

Researchers at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland claim that the process can be used to create buildings and spaces that resemble geological formations. The researchers are currently seeking commercial partners to further explore the potential of their discovery.

In a separate project, Chinese scientists have 3D printed an aeroplane made out of concrete. The lightweight carbon fiber skin replaced traditional steel and made the aircraft lightweight, strong, and durable.
