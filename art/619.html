analyze our customers' shopping data. This
new technique will help us better understand 
what a user has been looking at within our
Web site and will assist us in presenting more
relevant advertisements.
We're still collecting customer browsing
data in order to implement this system.
To continue using the site, you must agree
to the terms in the user agreement page at
https://cglenco.com/web/legal.
We ask that you take a minute to read 
the content, and if you agree with the terms
and to the privacy policy, then we ask 
that you click the "Agree" button.
Otherwise, you are free to choose "Not 
to agree with these terms".
You may then simply navigate away from the 
screen without any obligation to continue 
shopping.
In order to implement this system, you must
continue browsing the site, so if you do 
decide to "Not to agree" with the terms,
you may simply close the current Web page.
For new users who haven't previously agreed 
to our terms, clicking the "Agree" button
or continuing to use the site shall indicate
your consent to this agreement.
As part of continuing the use of the Web site,
the user also agrees to the terms of our 
privacy policy, which can be found 
at https://cglenco.com/web/legal.
These terms and conditions and the privacy
policy may be amended from time to time 
as we continue to improve our services.
If there is a substantive change, we'll notify
our users through our e-mail database 
(cgs_feedback@cglenco.com) as well as 
our official Web site and via the terms.
The user will be given a reasonable amount 
of time to review the revised policy and 
should take the time to save a copy 
for their records.
By agreeing to our terms and our privacy policy,
the user is fully aware of how we use and 
distribute the data they provide. This
includes making the data available for 
further use by our clients, affiliates 
and other third parties.
We have the right to change these 
terms from time to time at our discretion.
As we change our services, we may ask 
the users to agree to new terms and 
provide consent to additional services 
and provide the user with updated information
about our privacy policy.
The user will have the opportunity to consent
or disagree with each of the changes.
Once these changes are complete, the user
is fully aware of the services, privacy
policy and how we will use the data in the
future. If the user disagrees with the changes,
the user can stop providing any of the collected
data. The user is free to stop using the site
at any time without further obligation.
The user agrees that the terms for our services
and privacy policy will be enforced 
by CGL's network-based advertising 
and behavioral targeting services.
The privacy policy explains how the collected
data will be used and disclosed to third
parties, and by continuing to use the site,

conditions as well as any amended terms
that may be added in the future.
