Ask HN: Who has the best job at an American tech company? - cfontes

I&#x27;m talking about people who spend all their time at the office or in the office (not fielding customer calls or such) working on the company&#x27;s tech product.

The best job: making millions and a lifestyle of traveling around the world.

I've made a lot of mistakes in the past, and it seems that the people who are
making a lot of money are the ones who jumped on the bandwagon as soon as it
got started, and then spent every waking moment getting their share of the
action. Even though I make a lot more money than them, I still have a lot of
responsibility and stress.

I'm currently working my way up to having a few million in my bank account. It
seems this is the only way to have a solid income. My advice is to do all the
part-time side projects, build a network of contacts, then jump on a company
as soon as it gets off the ground.

I do consulting gigs for a living, and I agree with paulhauggis' advice. If
you're a true consultant (you provide the product or service yourself, rather
than just selling a service), then you can build up your own product line to
add to your consulting gigs and leverage the demand you build up. This way,
the actual money you make isn't directly proportional to the time you spend on
a project, but it can grow to that proportion in time.

I have some friends who run a popular social media marketing platform for SaaS
companies. They do some consulting gigs for non-SaaS companies, but don't
have the time to develop their own software so they can be in a position to
offer those SaaS companies. To get around that, they started their own
SaaS/consulting company that offers the service they give other companies
without that particular expertise (in the case of my friends, it's marketing
strategy and consulting).

To me, the best job would be a full time developer that can do the
following:-

    
    
      - code from scratch
      - do UX and wireframes
      - talk to customers
      - have a decent idea of the current tech stack
    

I see so many junior developers that can only code and do basic ops work. And
this is a waste of talent. Because this is not what companies are looking for.

I feel like the best work is in that middle ground: where you have the freedom
to try a lot of ideas, but are given a team who is there to improve your code
and design. This is not an easy position to be in, but I think for people who
want to build on their career and keep growing with the industry this can be a
good start.

I've had the most fun in my career doing this. There is a lot of work to do,
but there is so much more to learn than a junior level.

The best job is working for a consultancy - you work with a number of other
people in the same time and on many different projects, while being able to
focus on one big thing at a time.

That would be like $300k/year and would be done in 4-5 years. Or do you have
another suggestion?

I've been consulting for over 35 years now-- the best job, to me, is the one
with the most freedom to experiment.

If your goal is to make good money and you're OK with doing something for $12K
per month, you're never going to get there.

I'm in my last 3 months of my internship before moving back home. Best company
I've worked for so far. Everything is made so easy and enjoyable. I don't feel
hounded all the time with stuff that has nothing to do with coding.

At our company we work from home and have lots of freedom.

The best job: a remote work in a country that is peaceful and welcoming for
foreigners with a great currency, low cost of living, where the language is
easier to learn, not a foreign language. And other positive traits to make a
life interesting.

I worked at several positions at small and large companies. It really depends
on the company. I worked at a start-up in Boulder, Colorado that had some very
interesting technology. I now work at a small start-up in New York City that
has an even smaller budget.

Honestly, this is pretty close to my ideal job.

 _If_ you don't care about having lots of stock options or RSUs or any of
that... and you don't care about the office politics, and you don't care about
the politics of your particular team... then this is pretty much what I'd
like.

Of course there are some downsides as well. One thing I've had a hard time
adjusting to is the long hours. In the past I spent 16-20 hours a day coding
on most days, but then again, that's what I enjoy doing anyway. But right now
there's not a _lot_ of "go" in the day, and it takes a long time to finish up
everything.

I feel the same way. I haven't seen people doing a full day's work in an
entire year.

Sometimes it seems like there should be. I'm finding myself getting a bit
stressed about the lack of "go" though, mostly because of this. The company
I'm at now is an "agile" company and it's my impression that they don't do
hourly billing (at least, not anymore), but it seems hard for me to find a
balance between not showing up on time for meetings, which would seem to imply
you don't care about the company, and overloading yourself with stuff that has
nothing to do with code.

Hm, can't be as bad as some shops though. One coworker of mine spent 5 hours
looking at a video a coworker had recorded, then two hours on Skype with a
coworker a plane ride away (and not paying attention to my side of the call).
But he's really friendly and</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:23
