Scott Guthrie has created an article discussing some new ASP.NET 3.5 features. These include the introduction of LINQ to SQL (see the article for more information) and LINQ to Entities (see code below). You can read more details on these features on Scott’s blog at
http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/07/02/ef-4-2-model-validation.aspx

This blog post introduces the ASP.NET MVC RC and also discusses some updates to ASP.NET MVC 2.0 RC 1. As of RC 2, the new feature that is most noticeable is the ASP.NET Dynamic Data Web Grid (see http://www.asp.net/dynamicdata for more information). You can learn about other new features on the ASP.NET blog at http://blogs.msdn.com/aspnet/.

A new version of nunit-console was released, nunit-console-2.1.1.0, which fixes a bug with the command-line options for nunit2nunit.

The Web Platform Installer now works with the 3.5 beta release, so you can now install the RTM release of the 3.5 framework, without having to downgrade your current installation. Note that the Web Platform Installer does not support extensions to the 3.5 framework yet.

ASP.NET 3.5

What's new in ASP.NET 3.5?

Scott Gu explains the new features in the 3.5 version of ASP.NET, while also providing links to additional resources at http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/07/02/ef-4-2-model-validation.aspx.

Visual Basic

Scott Guthrie has written an article introducing a preview of LINQ to Entities. You can read more details on these features on Scott's blog at http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/07/02/ef-4-2-model-validation.aspx.

Scott Gu discusses changes to System.Windows.Forms. Here is an overview of these changes from Scott's blog:
http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/07/02/windows-forms-changes-for-vstudio-2010.aspx

System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase and System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController are no longer referenced from the .NET Framework. To use either type, add a reference to the System.ServiceProcess.dll assembly from the .NET Framework.

Entity Framework

The Entity Framework Team has released a new release candidate for the Entity Framework. The new release candidate has three new features:

LINQ to Entities, LINQ to SQL, and LINQ to Entities Dynamic Query now compile all queries as expression trees, which improves performance.

The Entity Framework is included in the “Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 2 Tools Update,” which is an extension for Visual Studio 2008 that includes templates and other extensions for ASP.NET MVC 2 RC 1. You can get more information on this extension at http://aspnetmvc.codeplex.com/.

As you can see, LINQ to Entities is an alternative to Linq to SQL. LINQ to SQL has not changed.
