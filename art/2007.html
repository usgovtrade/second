The team has won the national pasttime baseball title 10 times.

The PCC Pirates teams include two levels:

(1) A youth level (U-12 and up) in which several age-based teams are organized. Each team plays only other teams within its division, and only non-players can coach. Teams that are not yet eligible for playoffs can play a non-league schedule. All teams must play a league schedule. Teams from the adult league may join a U-12 or U-14 team to play.
The (U-12) players try out and are judged based on hitting, fielding, and pitching skills. The coaches are the parents of the players. Each season is organized into five levels. A player may play for only one team at a time. A player can be reassigned to another team if his current team is disqualified for any reason, and if it is in his best interests to play on another team. Each level is a competition. A player may remain on a team if he attends any level (except highest) that he wants to.
(2) A youth baseball organization. This organization does not have to play under rules to any national association.

In 2008, the PCC league has about 14 team and is expanding its youth program to create a new interest in baseball. The league teams include U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16 and U-19 in baseball teams.
