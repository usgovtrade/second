By: Kate Tietje // June 18, 2014

You’ve probably heard it all before: vegans are deficient in iron and calcium; you can’t get enough protein on a plant-based diet; and if you’re planning on having children, you’re setting your kids up for life-long nutritional neglect. While we’re still discovering the full scope of the plant-based diet’s abilities, we do know for certain that not all plant-based diets are the same.

Vegetarian diets are made up of many different foods, ranging from plant-based proteins to non-dairy cheeses to soy and almond milks. And so are the benefits – but if you’re confused, here’s what you need to know to make sure that you’re getting the most out of your meal plan.

Myth #1: It’s important to get enough protein to keep healthy.

If you’re a vegan, it may not seem like a big deal, but if you’re looking for an excuse to avoid getting enough protein, you might as well stop reading. The fact is, protein intake is often a concern for non-vegans, too. But the main thing to remember is this: the human body gets all the protein it needs from whole food sources like grains, vegetables, and legumes, which are also the most nutritious ones.

People may worry about getting enough protein if they choose an unbalanced diet with too much fat, not enough carbs, or not enough fiber. But a balanced diet, including enough protein from the foods you choose to eat every day, can still be a healthy one.

And even though some forms of animal protein are more easily digestible than others, the best dietary source of protein for people who are consuming enough calories is usually a good source of plant protein. In fact, in some people a plant-based diet can be even more effective for controlling blood pressure. The bottom line: if you’re eating a wide variety of plant foods, you’ll get all the protein you need.

Myth #2: You need protein supplements if you’re vegan.

Just because you don’t eat meat doesn’t mean you can’t get all the protein you need, especially if you have a good source of plants that include vegetable proteins, like soy or legumes. If you’re worried that you’ll run short on protein, it might be best to consult with your doctor or dietitian to come up with an individualized plan.

But if you do decide to take a supplement, make sure it’s vegan-friendly – there are plenty of vegan protein powders and other foods that are dairy-free and egg-free. One vegan protein powder to watch out for is whey, which is made with milk and eggs.

You should also check to see that your protein supplement has no added fillers or artificial ingredients. Some protein bars are also made with gelatin, which is not suitable for vegans.

Myth #3: You need supplements to get enough iron.

If you’re worried about not getting enough iron, a supplement might not be the right solution, especially if you’re relying on non-dairy cheeses and soy products to get enough protein.

“Your body needs to be able to absorb [iron] in order for it to be absorbed into your bloodstream. If you’re not getting enough of those [natural] foods [like dairy and eggs], you’re going to have a hard time making your own body more efficient at absorbing it,” explains Stacie Haas, a vegan coach and wellness expert in Portland, Oregon. You might need to consult your doctor if you have iron deficiency.

Myth #4: You have to count calories to lose weight.

When most people hear the word “diet,” they think of a “diet food” with a few calories and fat. But being vegan doesn’t mean you have to starve yourself or count every calorie. For example, think about brown rice. It’s an excellent source of whole grain carbohydrates and whole grains (which includes fiber and other nutrients) that are good for your heart. It’s considered a whole-foods plant-based diet.

By incorporating plant-based foods into your meal plans, you’re allowing yourself to eat a balanced diet while keeping your blood glucose levels low and your calorie intake in check. Not only can this help prevent diseases like diabetes, it can be the ultimate weight-loss tool. So forget all the rules about following a diet and go for it!

While the idea of a plant-based diet can be a polarizing topic in vegan communities, one thing that unites vegans is the belief that you can still be healthy if you eat a variety of plant-based foods. And it’s true that it’s not just what you eat, but how you eat that determines whether you’re enjoying a healthy, balanced diet.
