" There's one thing" "What is it?" "I want you... to kill that old man in red" "He's the only one who can find the Puppet Master" "What?" "Fine!" "No problem!" "I'll kill him at any cost!" "The Man with the Twin Swords" "Dad!" "Help..." "Help..." "Help..." "It's all because of that bastard" "Now there's nothing left for me... to take down with this" "I must find a replacement to get the 20 million dollars" "Where am I going to find him?" "I've heard that a cruel guy is here" "He uses different ways to torture his victims" "I can find him by getting help from the informants" "He must be a cruel guy" "He's so cruel" "The worst than I thought" "I can't even imagine he's capable of doing that" "I..."

"He can't see me" "He can't see anything now" "What did you say?" "This is his daughter..." "Is she?" "What are you talking about?" "He told me... he couldn't see you because you're not real" "I've only come for my dad" "My dad is right over there" "Where are you going?" "Let go of me!" "I have to go and find him!" "He's over there!" "You're still not real!" "You can't go!" "You can't go!" "I have to go and see my dad" "Let me go!" "I have to go and see my dad" "He's looking for me!"

"I can't see her anymore" "You won't let go of me" "You'll never let go of me" "Never let go..." "Never let go..." "Let me go!" "Let go of me!" "Are you my daughter?" "My daughter!" "My daughter..." "You're back" "Yes, I'm back" "Are you alright?" "I'm alright" "Who are you looking for?" "The man who had the Twin Swords" "He killed many people" "I must find him no matter what" "I must find him" "You need a rest first" "No..." "No..." "I have to go now" "The sun has already set" "You'll never find him at this hour" "I've got to go now..." "No matter what, I have to go" "It's dangerous at night" "What are you doing?"
