Apostle Paul warned that we are living in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ the Manifestation, when the world will come to its end; yet he said that God would make them apostates:

For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:11-13, 15-16)

Notice what apostle Paul says, that the world is coming to its end, for which a time of apostasy has been announced by Jesus Christ (Matt 24). But you will find that apostate Christians, or worse still, apostate preachers do exist in these last days of the Church age, while the time of the Church is still to be seen. Even in our own time, with all the signs of prophecy in Revelation 2 and 3 manifesting its fulfilment, there are many so called preachers that teach and act contrary to the Holy Spirit and His teachings as contained in the Bible.

The prophecy of the Manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ was proclaimed among the apostles in these words:

For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work. And the common good of the Aremites and their rulers: for which cause I also have confidence in you, in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but with fear, knowing what is the will of God. (2 Thess 1:7-10)

The preaching of such preachers is a lie which only causes confusion among God's elect, who must not be deceived. This preached error is not love of the truth, but deceit. It is apostasy, or a denial of the truth, from the beginning, not something that is only possible after we have believed it. It must be something from which he who is preached into apostasy cannot be saved. Therefore all those that are saved will be saved by means of the Holy Spirit:

Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. (2 Cor 8:1-5)

By these words, we learn that salvation is from God, and not from man, or from his ways, or methods.

God's mercy, however, does not extend to those that refuse to repent, who have strayed far from Him and the holy commandments:

And there came from the Jews false witnesses, saying, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. (Matt 26:60)

Who must give an account for their life when death shall come to them for their evil:

And if any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. (1 Cor 3:15)

In order for the Lord to remain a God of truth, with all that has been told to the prophets and angels of heaven, He must be truth, and not deceit:

I am the God of truth. (Rev 22:20)

Many in these days of late have fallen away because they have neither learned the truth of the Bible nor understand God, who is truth:

Because thou sayest, I am poor and needy, and the LORD hath taken away from me these things, that I ought to have: but thou dost not make my poverty thy righteousness. (2 Cor 6:1)

The Lord Jesus Christ, who is the very truth:

And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. (Mathew 22:37-38)

The Word of God:

I speak the things which I have seen with my Father. (John 20:31)

Thus in all things of doctrine, the Lord Jesus Christ must be the truth, to be understood only by those who are in the truth, namely, God's elect:

Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen. (Jude 24,25)

And this is what God spoke to them in the heavens:

And I saw as the flame came up out of his mouth: and as the smoke {there } went up: {out of the} mouth of the {LORD }[YHWH] of hosts. And the {angels of the } heavenly host came {out of the temple}, in the {sanctuary}, and brought the glory of the LORD {there } down {from heaven} in the sight {of man}. And the {LORD }[YHWH] of hosts set a bright cloud over them. (Ezek 1:26-28)

And said, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, all his works are truth. (Rev 15:3)

The truth is from the Lord, as Jesus said:

For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. (Romans 1:16)

It is truth, for God's word is truth, and is the spirit of truth:

But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same an</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:23
