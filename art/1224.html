I find this line of thought particularly silly, because if you are working alone, you probably shouldn't be a game designer. You're going to have a bad time as soon as people start playing your game. What I want in a good game designer is someone who is passionate about the game experience and game design and someone who is capable of putting their needs aside to make a good game. The "I make games so I can play them" attitude is exactly what leads to bad games.



At the end of the day, the best reason for an independent game designer to join a company is to be able to afford better hardware. Sure, maybe there's a chance you could convince someone to let you get away with an incredibly simple low-tech game because of your "unique vision", but if you can't afford your own GPU then it doesn't matter anyway. If you find yourself wanting to make a game that's better for others to play, maybe it's time to go find a job at a company.
