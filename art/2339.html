Hello,



It's a good idea. You can find an example implementation of a crawler at:



http://mistergrabby.com/search/search.html?search=cat



It may not be the fastest or most accurate crawler around, but it's not too bad for it's simplicity and it allows you to get a pretty good idea of how to implement a crawler using javascript, especially if you are a n00b like me.



One other thing that would be cool is if it used ajax/json or whatever javascript thing to update the web page (when you click the mouse). That would be really cool, like so it would update and scroll automatically and you wouldn't have to click on anything. Just thought about it a few seconds ago and a few other things but it was hard to do all of them at the same time.



Just some suggestions, keep it up! If you want to know how the crawler works, look at source code in JavaScript.



Your email looks good. Keep it up.

PSS: A great way to get the whole word out in a community-based web-site is to post it on it's forums and leave a post on IRC. Get in touch with the IRC admin and make him see that you are doing something good for him. Make him see that your action (spamming) brings other good actions that the other users will appreciate.



PSS: If you know of an event that you want to attend, and you think you can get a good turnout for it, then create a website that explains it and add the event website as a link. Make it look nice. Maybe even make it look good on a handheld computer. It may cost you money for hosting fees, etc. so it's important to have a goal and then find the way to achieve it.



I found something out about your email:



- It's cool that you found out how email was put together and how it works in general.

But you need to think about the reason why your email address was hidden.

The reason is simply that you chose not to make your email address public. It's

called email anonymity. A lot of websites don't allow email addresses to be seen

out in the open.



Your email is actually a public-directory entry on the site. When they use your

email address for advertising purposes, then the user of your email address will

get an advertisement from you (your email address) which you don't want! It's the

same thing as the spam that you get.



So the reason why your email address is hidden is because it may confuse other

people with your advertising that you will not really have. They are just seeing

it like a little advertisement.



So if you are the one who advertises, then you need to think about it.



Keep up the good work.



- Sander
