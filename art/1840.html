The media and 'fake' news were so upset they banned me forever. Great job!" Trump tweeted.

"I hope others will be inspired by my experience and join me in taking a strong stand for freedom, free speech and liberty," Greenfield added.

She tweeted that â€œthe fact of the matter is the people calling me a fascist are the fascists."

"I'm a freedom fighter against sharia and jihad. Be clear: Fascists the likes of Bannon & Gorka work for my opposition," she wrote.

"While they may be able to silence my Twitter feed, they will not silence my spirit."

"I have no regrets," she added.

On Sunday, Bannon said: "They tried to call us racists, and they failed. They tried to call us nativists, and they failed. They even tried to call us fascists, and we are not fascists."

Bannon, who joined the Trump campaign in August 2016, had a heated public spat with Greenfield and others earlier this week.

He resigned from the White House on Aug. 18, shortly after Charlottesville, Virginia, following the violent weekend clashes involving white nationalists and counter-protesters.

Greenfield, who has a background in conservative politics, is a regular on Fox News and has written for Breitbart.com, which Bannon ran until joining the Trump administration.

She had criticized some of Trump's policies on social media, most recently blasting his executive order temporarily banning the entry of refugees and travelers from seven majority Muslim countries.

And before his ouster, Bannon reportedly had an uneasy relationship with the president.

The New York Times reported Friday that "Mr. Trump soured on Mr. Bannon and thought he was leaking information to reporters about the White House."

Bannon reportedly expressed his anger to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that leaks about the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., were hurting the president and his agenda.

Bannon said he told Kushner, "The campaign should be about Donald Trump. This isn't about your issues. It's not about your stuff," The Times reported.

A source also reportedly told The Times that Bannon was critical of Kushner's negotiating skills for a Middle East peace agreement.

The former chief strategist's ouster was followed by that of former press secretary Sean Spicer. Both departures were described as falling under the umbrella of chief of staff Reince Priebus.

Bannon and Trump had also reportedly clashed over Trump's handling of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Trump blamed the violence in part on "both sides."

Bannon supported moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while Trump had not yet made the move.

Bannon also championed a campaign for tariffs against China, reportedly at odds with the president, who has publicly called China a "currency manipulator."

The Daily Caller reported in December that the relationship between Bannon and Trump was deteriorating.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY on Sunday.
