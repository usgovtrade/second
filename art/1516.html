The phrase became a popular chant amongst those at the match and has been performed, along with other words of the song, at the Wembley Final ever since. Similarly, at that same match, the phrase "This is an English revolution!" was uttered by the Chelsea fans in a reference to the song which echoed their actions of putting a red carnation in their Chelsea shirt which was designed in homage to the song. In 2016, the anthem was performed at the match between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur by the Chelsea Pensioners, as well as being performed by the Wembley choir.

Recordings
The album's original release was issued in three formats:
 a limited edition album (containing 12 tracks), released on 7 October 1968,
 a deluxe package containing the LP, together with a 3-track 7" single on one side, and a picture sleeve 7" single on the other, released by Polydor Records Ltd., and
 a standard album released in the USA by RCA Records, containing 13 tracks and released on 11 December 1968.

On 22 June 2004, EMI released a 16-track CD single to mark the 50th anniversary of the song's release, with 14 tracks taken from the original track list (minus the "Chim Chim Cher-ee" intro), and two previously unreleased bonus tracks. The track listing was:

The track entitled "The Flower Duet" appears in two versions. The version released in 1968 featured Ray Ellis on accordion, which was later removed for the 2004 version.
