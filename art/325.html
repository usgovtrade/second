solve this problem.  It's a more general solution that should work for 
almost any OLE DB provider.  We use this technique in SQLNCLI.  It also 
applies to OLE DB Bulk Loader, an excellent tool that ships with SQL 
Server 2000.

There are only three steps to the solution:

1.  Use "CursorType=adOpenDynamic" on your insert command.  This tells 
OLE DB to put the rowset handle in the Command object.

2.  Get a valid rowset from the Command object.

3.  Make your insert with the rowset.

For example, to solve the insert problem with Excel using dynamic 
cursors, do the following:

--Create test table and put data in it
Create table ExcelTest
(ID int identity, Data varchar(100))

--Insert into ExcelTest using an insert command object
Insert into ExcelTest
   (ID, Data)
select 1, 'This data goes to the first row in Excel'
union all select 2, 'And this data goes to the second row'

--Get the ID of the first row in Excel. Excel has added rowset handles
--to the command object.
declare @InsertID int
set @InsertID= (Select Min(ID) from ExcelTest)

--Open a dynamic cursor and get a recordset from the command.
--The rowset is a real, live rowset, so we can use the "openrowset" command
--as if it were any other rowset.

declare @rowset_type as nvarchar(128)
declare @open_mode as int
declare @fetch_size as bigint

set @open_mode= 2
set @fetch_size = 1

exec master.dbo.sp_OACreate
  @objname=N'dbo.OpenRowset',
  @object_id=@rowset_type OUTPUT,
  @fetch_direction=@fetch_size,
  @ownsobject=1,
  @hastransaction=1

declare @RC int
exec @RC=@open_mode

--Now we get the rowset handle in our command

set @InsertID=@InsertID+@fetch_size

--Finally, we can get an INSERT command that works with the rowset handle.

select 'This next set will load the rows in the OLE DB rowset into SQL Server.'
--If you didn't get the rowset handle and the next line fails, open a separate
--command object, open a cursor, then call the 'next' function to get the ID
--of the rowset handle.

--We have the rowset handle now, so we can insert rows into our destination
--table.

 exec sp_executesql @Statement = N'Insert into Test
   (ID, Data)
   values (@ID, @Data)',
   N'@ID int, @Data varchar(100)',
   @ID=@InsertID, @Data='This data goes to the last row in Excel'

--If all is well, the above insert statement is executed, and the row gets
--inserted into the destination table.

select *
from Test
order by ID

--Clean up
drop table ExcelTest
drop table Test
drop table #test

Now, with this, you can insert rows into any destination table from
OLE DB or OLE DB Bulk Loader. It works with all database vendors
supported by SSIS.  

This solution was implemented in SQL Server 2005 RTM. 
We hope it helps to save you the headaches you've been having with
inserting data into a destination table from an OLE DB or OLE DB Bulk 
Loader source table.

This is an excellent article!
Thank you!

I was trying to pass in arguments using OLE DB Sources which use an ADO Recordset.  The "use multiple ADO objects" part did not seem to make sense so I did not try it.  Is this a valid use case?  I can't seem to find a clear documentation on this part... maybe I'm using the wrong search term.

A:

There is a similar question on MSDN for multiple ADO connections:  Multiple Active ResultSets and ADO.NET.  This was probably written for Visual Studio 2005, but it should be valid for SQL Server 2005 also. 
This MSDN page: How to: Open a DataReader Using a SQL Server Connection has a code example for multiple ADO recordsets. Also check out this question on MSDN SQL Server Connection Pooling and Multiple Active ResultSets
