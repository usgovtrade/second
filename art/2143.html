Don't get me wrong, The Lost City of the Monkey God is an amazing, action-packed thriller. But it's not an incredible work of art like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.

If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, The Lost City of the Monkey God doesn't compare in the slightest bit, regardless of your political stance. I'm a hardcore conservative, and I still think The Lost City of the Monkey God should be read by anyone who wants a good thrill ride. And the next time you watch Lord of the Rings, imagine how the movie would have been like with just about any other story.

Rating: 7 stars out of 10

The Lost City of the Monkey God. By Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Published by Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press. Available in stores now.

I'm a former 1L at UCLA, so I know a thing or two about the legal system in general, but I definitely wasn't ready for the brutality that a real-life law practice is capable of. I don't mind a little "lawyer comedy" in my legal thrillers, but sometimes it went too far.

The Lost City of the Monkey God (TCOTMG) is a lawyer thriller with all the drama, legal proceedings, and even courtroom action that you could want. I was riveted throughout the entire book.

It's a great, short read - maybe just a little under 200 pages - and in terms of plot and writing, you will not be disappointed.

I do have one issue though. I feel like a lot of the characters were either stock characters or they were "good guys" that were so good it felt kind of like they were in a Disney film.

In a legal thriller, it's good to have a lawyer that doesn't go around blabbing like a ditz. I don't mind them, but when he does that, I am thrown off.

If you can overlook the legal system and just enjoy the thriller aspect of the book, I think The Lost City of the Monkey God will appeal to a wide range of readers. It is a fast-paced story that is full of twists, turns, and excitement.

You can't judge a book by its cover, but you can learn a lot from the cover of a book. For example, if you see a little girl in suspenders and pigtails staring at you and smiling while holding a toy, it is probably not going to be good.

But sometimes, just because the cover doesn't look like it is going to be as good as it ends up being, doesn't mean you should just avoid it.

In today's book review, you will get the inside scoop on a book that I would bet many other people have never read, which is a good thing because I think it is a waste of time.

A reader's guide for: The Island of Doctor Moreau by H.G. Wells

By Nathan Smith

Reviewed by Nathan Smith

I think The Island of Doctor Moreau by H.G. Wells is a great novel. It is definitely one of the best novels I've ever read, and it will likely be one of my top ten favorite novels ever, but when I saw the cover, I thought it was a book I wouldn't even want to read.

I guess that makes me sound like a jerk or something, and it is not my intention to be like that. But when I see a cover that doesn't look very good, I sometimes have to get past my assumptions before reading the actual book.

I don't think you should take this too seriously though. It's all just a fun little game to think about how good a book cover can be and if it can really be so good that you would actually want to read the book. So today's lesson is: do not judge a book by its cover.

The main issue is that I always thought this novel would have been much better if it were written as a straight horror story. All the elements of the book are there, so I do not have any problems with the book itself. In fact, I was actually kind of relieved because it took some of the pressure off of me in the sense that I was thinking I was going to have to read an awful novel, when all I had to do was just get through the story.

As for the main villain of the book - Dr. Moreau - I think the book was actually kind of smart and that it really did a good job at writing what you would expect from Dr. Moreau, or at least what I thought he would be like. He comes off as a sadistic mad scientist who is just the epitome of evil in a very classic sense, and everything about him was really spot on. He even has a cool voice that you would expect him to have.

Some readers might not really find that appealing, but I actually really liked the voice the narrator had. It made me think of movies like Nosferatu or The Wolf Man.

My only complaint with this novel is that you get to know the main character a little too well. He was so much of the story, that you got to know him really well in a little less than one hundred pages.

You also would think that knowing all of this about him would have been great for the main character, but it's kind of hard to pull off. It's like when you see that guy in the book who was killed and he had all these awesome qualities, but he really should have been a more normal guy. It was very hard to believe the narrator when he described himself as being that bad when he didn't really have all that much character. He was just all over the place.

So overall, I'm really glad I picked this book up, and I'm sure I'll read it again some time soon. It really does do a great job at being what you would expect from a Dr. Moreau novel, but it still has its own originality and twists.

If you've never read a Dr. Moreau novel before, it might not be one of the top Dr. Moreau novels to read, but I think it is a great intro for anyone who wants to read another classic horror story.

There's nothing I love more than a horror movie or a thriller novel that has a cool twist or turn. That is exactly what you get with The Island of Doctor Moreau. There's a cool horror twist at the end that I thought was pretty creative and gave me the impression that I didn't know what I was doing at the time I was reading it.

I do think you need to be in the right frame of mind in order to appreciate The Island of Doctor Moreau. In other words, you need to want a good thriller novel that is one of the best thrillers I've ever read.

When I first saw the title for this novel, I thought it was going to be a different story because it says "Doctor Moreau" in the title and that made me think it was going to be about a famous doctor who was somehow involved in animal experiments or some sort of Frankenstein-like story. The title was quite misleading, as was the cover.

I'm pretty sure that everyone knows who Moreau is. I don't think they would have written a book called The Island of Doctor Moreau if they wanted you to think it was about something else. I'm sure that is why there are so many references to H.G. Wells and this book in general, but I still felt mislead and kind of annoyed by it.

When I read it, I was just not a big fan of this book. I did like that it is such a fun, fast-paced novel that will take you all the way to the end with lots of action and surprises. I also really liked the writing style. It had a fast pace, but not too much. It was actually</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:02
