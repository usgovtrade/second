He’s right. “The Martyr Approach” is full of big soundscapes, sweeping strings, cinematic beats, and lots of emotion, all delivered by the warm yet hushed voice of lead singer Mark Henson. With so much talent involved, it’s no surprise that the project is just as good as everyone wants it to be.

Henson tells us, “I like having guests on songs because you can create a unique connection between the song and the guest artist. At the same time, we were looking to not just sound good but sound better than what our guests might be doing themselves. If the guest’s voice is better than mine then I may as well pack it in and get another job.” It makes sense then that “The Martyr Approach” features talented vocalists such as D.R.U.G.S. (UK hip hop trio) and Ravi Martin, who’s voice is featured on the final track.

‘The Martyr Approach’ is not a concept album. Instead, it’s a collection of songs by various producers, showcasing Henson’s vocals in addition to his new-found love of R&B and electronic soundscapes. Tracks like ‘Black Magic’, featuring the vocals of the incredible D.R.U.G.S., shows a new direction for Henson in which he showcases a dark and soulful side of his vocal performance, while still maintaining his signature melodic sound. That’s exactly what we love about Henson, his voice perfectly captures a sense of melancholy with his unique ability to convey emotion in his songs, whether or not he’s singing or rapping.

The album title is also no mistake. Henson has this to say about it, “When you start working in the music industry, you become your own martyr.” And while his words hold true to some, Henson’s talent, in particular, has gone a long way in helping him realize his potential and craft a career he loves. Henson adds, “I realized that a big part of my motivation is a need for my voice to be heard. I’ve worked so hard at getting where I am and I deserve to be heard.”

‘The Martyr Approach’ is an ideal snapshot of a rising artist looking to the future, as well as an indicator of Henson’s willingness to improve. Even more important is the underlying emotion in Henson’s voice; he is the only thing holding his words together as he tells a heartfelt story of wanting to be a part of something bigger. In a world that has a plethora of “new talent” waiting to be heard, Henson is one of the few people in the game whose voice deserves all the attention.

‘The Martyr Approach’ by Mark Henson is out now on all streaming and digital platforms. You can download a copy on iTunes here.
