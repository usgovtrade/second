We want to make sure you have all the help you need when hiring a moving company. So, we've put together a list of the dos and don'ts of hiring a moving company. Read on for more information.

Do know the Cost of Moving

You can make all of your packing decisions easier by having an idea of what moving can cost you. Here's what the average cost of a move looks like.

Do Ask For References

We wouldn't hire a contractor to do work for us if we hadn't interviewed their references. The same holds true for hiring a moving company. Find out what their previous clients had to say about their experiences with them.

Don't Be Emotional About Your Valuables

Most moving companies will not accept responsibility for damages incurred in transit. If something happens, you should expect to deal with the situation in-house, and not with the moving company.

Don't Forget the Insurance

If there's any question, make sure you get a copy of the insurance policy for each moving company you consider. That way you will know how much coverage your belongings are actually receiving.

Don't Ask For An Estimate When The Truck Arrives

Most likely, you are already prepared to move, and you want the work to start as soon as possible. With that said, it is not in your best interest to rush a moving company into providing an estimate. That will put you at risk of overpaying for services.

Do Get Your Possessions Labeled

Not sure what to do with your possessions once you've moved them to your new home? Get some stickers, and use them to label your possessions. Make sure to stick them on every item.

Do Ask For A Discount When Doing the Job In Bulk

Some movers will be more than willing to help you save money on shipping costs. Ask for a discount on the move when you are relocating large amounts of items.

Do Not Pay In Advance

Do not pay a company in advance. You should not be expected to do so. If they need the money, they will ask for it when the job is done.

Do Not Give Any Extra Fees

You should expect to pay for mileage, food, and lodging if the movers bring them. Do not give anything in advance.

Do Ask For a Good Understanding of Terms

There are several factors that may affect the total cost of your move, like fuel surcharges, miles, and other moving issues. For example, some movers charge extra fees for long-distance moves. Make sure that your moving company has clarified all of these details.

Do Choose a Moving Company You Can Trust

Be sure to choose a moving company that will not be shy about asking questions. If you're not sure about what the moving company will do, make sure you discuss it.
