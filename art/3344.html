There's a lot of people out there who are basically saying that the idea of
putting a tiny box over the entire bottom 1/5 of your computer screen that has
a fixed-size window into the desktop is _dumb_ , and that this behavior should
be an easy thing to implement in every app out there. Basically, people like
this are re-inventing a window manager, by making all windows the size of a
square, and with a mouse-wheel in the corner of the window to change their
size. This is the fundamental idea (although, yes, they don't make the window
into a square.) The behavior and user interface here is just as much an
extension to a desktop metaphor, though, as OSX's "flipping" of windows or
their app's docking is; it's just the user's new "Desktop" interface, but with
the ability to "move" between the desktop elements. I actually think a lot of
people are going to buy into this, because it's an "easy-to-use" interface
that also, by necessity, removes _many_ of the most-used features of their
desktop environments.

People who re-invent a desktop environment have two major hurdles to overcome:
getting the user onboarded onto the new paradigm, and getting the major app
manufacturers to play along. The former has been done with varying degrees of
success, while the latter would require a _huge_ amount of developer buy-in,
and will be harder to get the adoption rate necessary. Remember that, in order
for OSX's Aqua interface to work, developers had to _design_ their apps to
play nice with it. With this method, you'd have to re-design your apps for
iOS-like touch interfaces _and_ to work in a "window" as the user has seen in
OSX for _years_ now.

So, good for them, I guessâ€”I'm sure it will generate a huge revenue stream.
And, of course, they're going to open-source the basic work so that, in the
future, this "concept" of window frames and icons can be used as the basis of
_any_ graphical interface. That's pretty good thinking for taking a completely
new interface concept and turning it into a revenue stream. Good,
unfortunately.

I'll second your sentiments on the user buy in. Most users are used to a
cursor and clicking stuff. On that basis, this is a fairly poor interface. It
really boils down to what the users need and want from an interface, and that
is not changing anytime soon. While these guys can make some serious cash by
creating the initial version of a completely new standard, they're going to
soon discover that this is the market they are in.

First, I want to give all the credit to the creators of the Aqua interface for
making some great UI patterns for developers. It is what drove them to where
they are today and they deserve a lot of praise. But this is the kind of stuff
that Apple got really good at doing, reinventing software paradigms. They are
not alone in this, Microsoft has historically been good at reinventing software
paradigms and doing it more times than anyone, however, Microsoft does a lot
of the same things as Apple and with far less innovation. There is something
interesting about watching Apple rip off another company strategy and innovate
on top of it. We do not see that a lot from Microsoft. Microsoft is a great
example of what happens to large companies that stagnate and are not able to
keep innovating in the wake of a new paradigm shift. In order for them to
reinvigorate they need to innovate, they can't simply rip off and copy, they
have to be original, their competitors are innovators.

As an aside, I recently purchased a Zune, for the first time in a few years I
bought a music player. I got tired of iTunes and the Apple culture around
music players, so I went out and did a bit of research and found that my
hardware and usage matched that of the Zune, and then was curious as to how
the product performed. I had not ever heard of Aqua, because I always buy
Macs, so I went into the Zune software wondering what the buzz was about, it
was really well designed for a music player. After going through the setup
wizard, it was clear that the designers knew their product and how they fit
into the market. Once I played my music though, I came to two conclusions,
firstly, I forgot I had a Zune. Secondly, I felt pretty bad that I had such a
cheap mp3 player, it was like carrying around a brick, however, it had a UI
that really fit my usage model (not a laptop, I am not carrying around the
thing). It was a solid UI, you know what you were doing, you know how to use
it. Sure the UI itself could use improvement, but it was the first time I had
truly seen a UI design like that in years. That is something Apple really
brings to the party and the other platforms do not. So when I saw this article
I had to re-read it again, because I had thought of myself as being fairly
pro-Apple, but the fact is, I used to think that they were reinventing UI
patterns when in fact the other OSs do it first. This makes me actually think
that MS is doing a bit better of reinventing UI's than we give it credit for.

Now if Microsoft can actually get some new ideas on how to architect software
it may turn into something interesting, or may not, but we are starting to see
the cracks in the traditional PC way of doing things.

There's a big difference between ripping-off another company's idea, and
re-imagining something from scratch (like they did with touch screens), which
is what Apple did here. What they did, is not really rip-off (Apple copied the
concept wholesale), it's very much inventing. They went from mouse cursor to
touchscreen. That's a major innovation. The concept is so fundamental, it's
surprising it took Apple this long to realise that there is something to do
about it. A similar thing is happening with the web. It's hard to imagine what
the web would look like without "Aqua", without Google, without Apple.

_What they did, is not really rip-off (Apple copied the concept wholesale), it
's very much inventing._

They didn't invent it, they just took it wholesale and made it a core part of
the OS. The iPhone OS is not the first multitouch OS (Symbian 3.0's gesture-
based user interface was already multitouch in its own way). The multitouch OS
on MacBooks was borrowed from UIQ, which was itself a rip-off of Symbian from
just a couple of years previously.

(This _isn't_ original to Apple -- UIQ was an early mobile platform from early
2000, originally designed by Psion. Later versions had Nokia support; UIQ was
also sold as an application platform that enabled "multitouch" applications
for Nokia's Symbian handsets, such as a full-scale photo album viewer app. It
did multitouch and all kinds of other clever things back then -- it was even
used by NEC to power some of their early multitouch PCs.)

Apple certainly deserve to take the credit for bringing multitouch to the mass
consumer in a mass-market device -- the iPhone is the first mass-market
consumer device to make multitouch a central part of its design philosophy.
And multitouch makes _every_ aspect of the UI easier -- whether it's flipping
the page on the built-in Safari browser or panning and zooming a picture
housed in iPhoto, it's all a lot more intuitive if you can just move your
fingers around on the display. But Psion was there first, and they've been
licking the Apple's heels ever since.

They've made it far more integral to the OS than UIQ was. They made the iPhone
use it, you couldn't do it without it, and you couldn't get it without buying
the iPhone (well, not easily, you can now emulate touch with a mouse).

To be fair, Apple didn't really invent the finger as UI metaphor -- that goes
back to Simon. But they did create the Apple Mouse.
