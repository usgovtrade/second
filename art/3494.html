But how about it ABC? You know they'll love to do it on a Saturday night. Heck, you might have to start putting extra commercials in on Friday night just for the "How low can he go?" crowd.

Wrapping up this particular topic of discussion, I bring you another one that has been in the news (albeit for its negative rather than positive connotations) lately. So many people out there would like to see some real, hardcore competition in NASCAR, just like it used to be back in the day. Even with the great new cars and such that have been developed, there really hasn't been any serious and heated racing.

And what about all the rule changes? I remember back in the day you didn't have any such thing as qualifying. But what about a rule change that would be helpful in this day and age? Wouldn't it be nice to have a rule that said if you get a penalty flag that you have to let everyone by you by? I don't know about you, but I think that would do wonders in racing today. And we'd have less people in need of a tow truck or a phone call to their doctor for a couple of hours of sleep.

I know it is early and the season has just started, but I would be willing to bet that we'll see some more action with something like that at some point in the near future. Maybe next year or the year after that, but I betcha it is coming eventually. I see the "stock car wars" coming down the road.

So how about it NASCAR? Or for that matter, how about it ESPN? Don't be afraid to have a little fun with it. After all, you are running an entertainment business and that is what entertainers (and their fans) do: they provide fun and excitement. But have some fun, get the fans to the race track and watch a little action. When all you have to do is get on the phone and let everyone know they can watch it on TV, you do not need to spend another dime on anything other than those commercials that keep showing you how to sign up.

And in the process, don't forget the small towns and the towns in general that make it all possible. After all, if the local business has a good day it will all of a sudden spring up an increase in your NASCAR ratings, and you are the benefactors!
