I'm too much of a perfectionist to do anything halfway. Even if it was something that everyone wanted to do, I'd still want to be the first person to do it."

'Survivor': "It doesn't feel like the same game now that we're watching it on television. If it had happened when I was playing, I would have been able to win, because I had the drive and the ambition that makes you willing to die for something. But there are plenty of others out there with what it takes to win. You see them on TV — these crazy people who are willing to put themselves in that position. Maybe it's just the American people who are so crazy they'd do it, or maybe there's something in us that we just don't see on television."

'Idol': "When I took home the last Idol trophy, I was shocked. I still feel like I don't belong out there. I feel like I'm in over my head. That's where I grew up and this is how I was raised. That's all I knew how to do. I'm not a TV personality and I never learned how to express myself, but Idol gave me the chance to do it and made me feel great about myself."

'The Biggest Loser': "The hardest part about it wasn't the physical aspect. It was fighting the feeling of not being good enough. I've always been big, but I was never good looking and I thought that the judges were constantly comparing me with all the amazing-looking women on the show. They picked me, but they chose the most athletic person, which is another reason I'm here. It was that lack of confidence and the pressure from it that was the biggest problem for me."

'The Bachelor': "The whole experience has been amazing. I had some rough times — being called out of my name because I wasn't the most attractive person there, but I thought there was more to me than just my looks. I couldn't believe it when I didn't get the final rose. I thought for sure I was a frontrunner, but I guess they didn't like me that much. I think it was good, though, because I wouldn't be here now if I hadn't gone through it."

'Top Chef Masters': "Being a Top Chef was interesting. I was a huge fan of Top Chef and watched every episode that aired, even the reruns, and when I got my call back from Top Chef Masters, it was as if I had already been watching it and that I was already a part of the show. But I still felt out of place."

'The Bachelorette': "I just learned the ropes while on 'The Bachelorette.' When they let me know that I'd be on TV, I thought I was doing it just to promote my book. But they really wanted me on the show, and when I was eliminated, I felt like I should have won. It was sad, and I didn't know whether I was going to cry or explode."

'The Amazing Race': "I hate not being able to make everyone happy and not finishing in first place. That's one thing I didn't really expect from reality TV. When I get to go out and meet people, though, I can make them smile. I love to hug people and tell them that they're really good looking, but they wouldn't appreciate it if I really told them that. That's the funniest thing: As much as people are all about themselves, they still need someone to tell them how good they look. I do that all the time, but it makes everyone happy. If there's anything I learned from reality TV, it's to be positive."

RealityTV.com: What's the reality behind your reality TV appearance?

David: "The book came out before I did, so I'd been writing it for months. I hadn't gone on any of the shows that everyone wanted me to be on, but I just kept going on TV because people would call me to promote it and the book. One day I thought it would be great to see how real-life friends would be. I knew people would enjoy it, so I thought, 'Why not just put my friends in a situation like this where we'll do anything to get a job or a reality TV show or whatever?' It's what I'd do with my friends."

RealityTV.com: Do you think you were ready for the spotlight?

David: "I'm probably a better actor than I thought I was. I wanted the show to be more about my friends' relationships, not my own. My best friends are a little older than I am, and they're all in relationships with each other, so it was perfect. When I get to work with the rest of them, I'm usually the only person in the room who doesn't have a relationship or isn't in a relationship. I thought it would be interesting to talk about what I do after I'm done with reality TV and I can't go on any more because I'm not married."

RealityTV.com: How would you describe yourself as a friend?

David: "I'm very upbeat and I try to make people happy. If my friends want to go to dinner and see a movie, I'll be right there with them."

RealityTV.com: What's the toughest thing about being in a long-term relationship?

David: "I think we really wanted to go into the next chapter and get married, and then we realized how much we both really wanted to pursue our passions."

RealityTV.com: What makes you different from your other friends?

David: "I'm probably a lot more outgoing and love to play a little game of pool or cards, or get on my bike and ride with them and jump off a bridge. I think they appreciate that, too, but I'm a little bit more on the quiet side and we appreciate each other for who we are, not for what we do."

RealityTV.com: If you weren't on reality TV and you were talking to someone you didn't know, how would you handle that?

David: "I'd tell them that I'm happy to be myself and let them know that I'm a nice guy, but I'm no different from anyone else. I like to have fun and I've learned how to have fun with everyone."

RealityTV.com: How long did it take to write the book?

David: "It took about three months to write it. Then I did a book tour. That's one thing I have in common with my friends: I love to travel. They're all over the world working."

RealityTV.com: Who do you consider to be your role model?

David: "Well, you've got to see what my mom does with her life and how she really fights to get things done. She makes a lot of money, and her work ethic is second to none. She inspires me, so she's my role model, but the person who inspires me the most is my son. I want him to know that you can do anything you want with your life if you put your mind to it. No matter what it is that you want to be, if you put your mind to it, you can do it. And the only thing you need is a little bit of inspiration and determination, and if you don't have that, you have to find that before you try it."

RealityTV.com: Do you like to compete?

David: "No, I'm too much of a perfectionist. I want things to be done right. If I go play basketball with my friends, I want to have a good game, and if they win, I want to win. It's important for me to do well with everyone."

RealityTV.com: What do you like to do on the weekends?

David: "I love to just hang out with my friends and have a good time. We're always having fun together, so we go for bike rides and go out and drink a lot of wine or play cards or play basketball or go on dates. Sometimes I go home and paint. The most special time is going to dinner with friends. We always like to go out and see how we can embarrass our friends by doing something fun and crazy."

RealityTV.com: You've lived in Nashville for nearly 25 years, but you still act like you live in New Jersey. What is the biggest misconception people have about you?

David: "Most people think that I don't want to get married, but that's not the case at all. I just got engaged and that's what made me realize how much I've missed in my own life. I love being in a relationship, but there's a little part of me that doesn't want to get married yet."

RealityTV.com: What kind of women are attracted to you?

David: "I have the best friends in the world, so I don't worry about that. If someone likes me because I'm successful, that's great. I also make good money, so I don't look for that in a girl. The more time and effort I put into this book, the better I am. It's not because I'm trying to get a girlfriend or put myself on a pedestal, but because I want</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:45
