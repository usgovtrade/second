The
original sin, or the first wrong that is
committed, was eating the fruit of
the forbidden tree. That is why we
are born with original sin, which
can be avoided only by a sacrifice of
our own free will. However, we are
given many advantages by God which
prevent him from showing such
cruelty and punish us so severely. It
is not as simple as some people think.
The forbidden fruit contained the
knowledge of good and evil. It is the
knowledge of good and evil that
puts you in a situation where God is
the only way out, for it shows us that
our minds must not think along with
God, but we must stop using the
knowledge that God gave us, and we
need to use the freedom that he gave
us. Man's mistake in eating the apple
is shown in a very interesting way in
a recent study of the evolution of
the skull by Dr. Charles D. Ossenberg.
Dr. Ossenberg had photographed the
skulls of more than 700 living primates,
from the gorilla down to the tiny
siamang, in order to find out if there
are any changes from one genus to
another, and to discover the order of
evolution in the skull. He found the
first signs of a change in the size of
the brain in man, and that we have
some of the smallest brains of all the
primates. His conclusions were based
on his finding of the human skulls of
the various hominid types of fossils
in South America, including the famous
Java man. The human brain grew and
atrophied in different areas at the
same time. The primitive australoid
types had, in all cases, a smaller
brain and a more human-like shape than
the primitive types, and all except
the last specimen, Peking man, had a
strong human-like face and brain
case. The Peking man, from what
remains of the skull, clearly had a
smaller brain.
Dr. Ossenberg stated that when you
look at the skull of any primate, if it
has a modern face and brain case, with
an angular face, that is an indication
of human ancestry. He also found that
the later types had the same features
as the earlier ones, and what makes it
interesting is that Dr. Ossenberg's
work indicates a gradual change in the
skulls of the hominids, and not a rapid
change. He also has a list of
characteristics in the skulls which he
believes are connected with the
"fall." Some of them are the forward
position of the ear, which is a sign
of walking upright, the flattening of
the nose, the reduction in the size of
the brain, and the lengthening of the
skull. Dr. Ossenberg believes that
most of the hominids were bipeds, not
primitive apes as Darwin said. He
says, "I don't see any hominids in the
fossil record which show evidence of
bipedalism which would contradict the
idea of a change from a more apelike
to a more human-like behavior."
Fossil evidence now places us in the
tree of life as man, while millions of
years ago our ancestors were only
ape-like. Man is clearly and clearly a
creation of God, not an animal nor a
primitive hominid. We were not born
knowing evil, just as we are not born
with knowledge of sin. Man has a free
will that he can use wisely or wrongly,
and if he uses his free will to choose
good he will receive God's reward. We
have a choice in everything that we
do. Our only salvation lies in our
willingness to be saved. Even when we
do wrong, God does not look at it as
our fault, but is more ready to
forgive us if we accept his offer of
redemption and show ourselves to be
able to live according to God's ways.
He is willing to forgive us and
accept us back into his family, if we
are willing to show our willingness to
accept the love of God and the way
that he requires us to live. In this
way, God gives us a perfect life. We
can have a life that is good without
getting any better. That is not the
way that life is meant to be lived. We
can receive the knowledge of good and
evil. It is up to us to use the
freedom God gave us to choose. But if
we choose to use the knowledge that
God gave us and follow the knowledge
of sin, God may judge us, for even
then we choose to separate ourselves
from God, and we must be saved from
that. God does not want us to suffer
for eternity, and he would rather have
us come to him and take the action of
salvation. Then we may know him as our
God and Lord and as our Savior. We can
look forward to a life with God, but
we must know that we must have his
love in order to receive his love. We
must accept God's love in order to
have it. It is up to us to accept God
as our God and accept him and his love
into our lives.
If we have chosen to do something
wrong we must be willing to repent of
that action. God is waiting for us,
and it is not too late for you to make
the decision that will make you a part
of God's family. If you don't choose
to accept his love and choose to take
up his offer of forgiveness for your
sins, then the life you live will be
full of suffering and misery, and there
will be no reason to ever think or
pray for God. But you can know that
God loves you, and you can rest in the
fact that there is nothing evil or
wrong with you at all, for you were
made in the image of God, and in him
there is no darkness. We are in the
light, and the light of God is that
which saves us. If you can think of
that as you go about your life, you
will know that God's light is in you,
and you will not be blind to
everything that is good and right, for
you are not really as evil as some
people would have you believe. If
God's light is in you, you will want to
go to him and to live in harmony with
him. Then you will not have to suffer
or be afraid, and you will be able to
experience the joy and peace of being
with him. It is not your sin that God
judges, but it is your unwillingness to
make the sacrifice to accept his love
for you. You will have the choice of
accepting him or rejecting him, for he
is more willing to have you live as a
child of God than to leave you to
suffer forever for his glory.
All
the good things that we know and love
in this world were created by God,
and if we have this world as a gift,
God's plan for us is to have as much
joy and happiness as we can in this
world, but still to know that God is
all powerful and in complete control.
God is in control of this world, and if
we love him, we will want to follow
his ways. God wills us to have the
best we can possibly have in this
world, and we will not be able to do
anything wrong. All the good things
will be available to us if we can only
find the way to God. He has given us
all the things we need to live life
fully, but not to use them to hurt
someone else or to be hurt by them. We
must choose to use them as God intended
that we should, and we must realize
that God can change our lives
forever, if we do not accept him as
our God and do not choose to accept
his ways. God will change our lives
if we will let him and love him.
Now
we must let God take over and give us
God's life of love, joy, peace,
happiness, and strength. God's way of
life will bring peace and happiness to
our hearts, minds, and bodies. He is
able to give us the strength to live
according to God's ways and so bring
him love and good in our lives. We will
find out that he is the One who is
giving us all the things we need to
live our lives full and happy in this
world, and that he will be able to
show us the way to a life of peace and
happiness. He is our Savior from the
sin and evil of this world. He is the
One who</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:28
