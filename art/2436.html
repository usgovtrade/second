It’s been a big month for the new ‘Bachelor’ contestant.

If you watch Lifetime’s ‘The Bachelor’ series, you might remember that Tia was the runner-up to Desiree Hartsock. But, while she went on to marry the former professional hockey player that she met on the show, for the time being she is still Tia. So she’s back as the host of our new Web Series ‘Tia’s Beauty Fix’.

Tia is one of the most popular beauty influencers on YouTube, sharing everything from her favorite cleansers to her tips for contouring, and even some new beauty products! I’m a huge fan, and think this web series is an excellent way to show her fans what she’s been doing for the last several years that they might not have seen before.

As a fellow beauty blogger, I’m happy to see someone who truly works hard at her craft. And it’s no surprise when someone who is a self-proclaimed beauty addict and blogger has also been able to build herself a real business as well.

The makeup artist, makeup artist, and lifestyle and beauty brand Tia Mowry, who is best known for her roles on the shows Desperate Housewives and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is launching a new beauty line in Canada, that will be hitting retailers in the new year.

According to Tia, she’s been on a natural lifestyle journey of late, and has learned a lot about the true origin of our favorite beauty products. She’s now using only plant-based and cruelty-free beauty and skin care products, and plans to open a “shop in heaven” in the not-too-distant future.

It’s not all about makeup and fashion for Tia though; she also has a new book called Beauty From The Inside Out coming out in Spring 2018, and will be releasing a beauty line with a portion of the proceeds going to charity. “Beauty From The Inside Out is the perfect title because I’m going to teach you how to achieve healthy glowing skin from the inside out,” Tia shares. “From what I’ve learned from all of the beauty lines I’ve tried, there are 5 things everyone should do to have beautiful healthy skin and achieve this glow…or just because.”

For Tia, this is about more than just a business or a brand, it’s about giving back. “I’ve always been open and honest about sharing my journey and my opinions about things with my fans, and I’m excited to share my new journey of being involved in a charitable effort for people with the book, and with Beauty From the Inside Out, our first ever charity initiative in my new product line,” Tia shares.

Stay tuned as Tia reveals her beauty line and book and what charity will be benefiting from them, coming up next week!

About me

A mother to a daughter who never gets old and a daughter who never gets young. A wife to a man who doesn’t exist, a mother who's younger than me, a manager who's younger than me, a tenant who's younger than me.

I live in suburbia, where children who never look up from their phone just try to make it home in time for dinner. I live in suburbia, where the drive is all important and the destination doesn't matter. I live in suburbia, where the only thing that matters is the house itself. I live in suburbia, where the grass might be fake but the sprinkler still rules the world. I live in suburbia, where my husband is a robot in disguise and my daughter is the spawn of a devil. And I live in suburbia, where I have forgotten the word for normal.
