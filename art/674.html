you can't control yourself. 
And they're already
criticizing your performance. 
And don't you think I can beat you? 
Don't call her that. 
Let's just put my hand down. 
Wait. Don't be so impatient. 
Look here. 
What the heck are you doing? 
What's with that attitude? 
What did she say? 
Why don't you ever leave 
when I need to practice? 
What is she saying? 
I don't want to hear it. 
I won't hear her. 
What? 
What do you mean? 
I am telling you, I don't like you! 
What's wrong? 
What did she say? 
Wait, please wait. 
Are you crazy? 
What's wrong? 
She looks furious. 
I told you to stay out of her 
hands! 
I won't listen to her anymore!
- You're not going to 
listen to your mother! 
- I don't care. 
You think I care about her? 
Don't even think about it! 
What? 
She's your mother? 
You're looking at her, 
but she's your mother? 
She's your mother? 
Tell me it's not true. 
No. She's your 
mother. 
She's just mean. 
This is your only son, 
after all. 
You raised him all by yourself. 
He has to stay in one piece. 
She's your mother? 
Where's your mother? 
Right there. 
In front of you. 
I want to meet her. 
Why?
What's up? 
Why are you hiding? 
Are you her mother? 
I can't believe you two are 
mother and son. 
- It's... 
- It's true. 
Why won't you tell me? 
You won't tell him? 
Is it true? 
You want to know 
if she's my mother? 
I told you, 
I don't like you either. 
You can have him. 
I don't want him. 
This is your only son. 
Do you even want to raise him? 
It's not like you have to pay 
for his living expenses, 
but you have to raise him. 
I won't. 
I really want to find my mother. 
My mom left me behind. 
I'm not going to care about him. 
Then she'd have to take care 
of him alone. 
I don't want him! 
She says she's not here. 
Did you really leave me? 
Look, she hasn't come back. 
This guy wants her back. 
What? 
She's your mother. 
Yes. 
Did he say his mother is here? 
But she's not here. 
That's right. 
You're telling me this 
yourself? 
Then it's true. 
It is. 
Thank you, mother. 
You can't! 
You can't cry and cry. 
Thank you, mother. 
Yes, I am. 
I am. 
I'm sorry. 
I shouldn't have done it. 
I'm sorry. 
So... 
I'm not going to forgive him 
for not forgiving you. 
Why not? 
Your mother did it too. 
You're still not over 
what I said? 
It's not your fault. 
Tell him... 
Tell him to come 
back in the real world. 
What are you saying? 
I need to take care 
of him for now. 
He'll understand. 
I won't give it up. 
Let him go. 
You're not his family. 
He's never leaving me again. 
So come here. 
Let's eat some delicious food. 
There. 
How did it happen? 
I don't know. 
How did I end up on a 
different world? 
You know, 
you don't look like 
you are related. 
How old are you? 
What do you mean? 
Oh. 
She looks different 
than me. 
When did I get this old? 
That's not possible. 
I'm 23. 
What about me? 
I'm 28. 
Your hair. 
It should be back to its original 
color by now. 
Aunt. 
Are you really my aunt? 
Don't call me that. 
My real name 
is Han Soo Jung. 
Han Soo Jung? 
That's what I'm called. 
That's me. 
I used to 
live in this house. 
I was in a really good 
relationship back then. 
Really? 
I was young and beautiful. 
I had two sons. 
One of them looked exactly 
like you. 
What about him? 
He disappeared a long time ago. 
A long time ago? 
Like... 
20 years ago? 
Yes, around that time. 
I don't know what happened. 
He disappeared one day and 
I never saw him again. 
Never came back? 
What happened? 
We'll talk later. 
Let's have lunch first. 
I've been missing 
it for ages. 
You're still here? 
You have to go back. 
I'm not going to 
leave her alone. 
Then why are you 
talking to her? 
Who else 
do I have to talk to? 
She's not a doctor. 
I'm still waiting. 
Let me do it first. 
I can't believe I'm still 
waiting for it. 
You're going to die waiting. 
Hey. 
You really can't stay here. 
She thinks I'm weird, too. 
I'm not even a real doctor, 
but I'm just her aunt. 
Let her do it. 
Why are you doing that? 
Aunt. 
Don't be rude. 
You want me to keep 
saying your name? 
What are you talking about? 
You should keep saying her name. 
I'm still your mother. 
Oh, I see. 
You'll tell me my family 
history if I do that. 
Oh, really. 
Let me introduce you to them. 
How cute. 
You don't have to do 
this anymore. 
You're still a child. 
I can tell she's 
only a child from that. 
Fine, I'll find out for you. 
Then I'll tell you 
your father. 
Hey. 
That isn't nice. 
You shouldn't be talking like that. 
We'll talk later. 
I'm talking to you. 
You'll be sorry. 
What is wrong with him? 
What did you just say? 
You're going to die 
saying that. 
You can't say that. 
What's wrong with you? 
Let's go. 
How can I say 
that to her? 
What if I say that to her? 
Excuse me. 
Do you want to die? 
Fine, I'll do it later. 
I need to talk to someone. 
I'll go after I have a talk 
with him. 
I want to talk to you first. 
Who? 
The boy in your bed. 
You haven't seen him 
in a long time. 
My bed? 
How is he? 
I'm worried he's 
not doing well. 
You're still lying here? 
It's been a long time. 
How has he been? 
How did I end up 
in a different world? 
How have you been? 
I just came back. 
What happened? 
Where are you? 
Is he sleeping? 
He's sleeping, right? 
Is he okay? 
He's okay, isn't he? 
He should be. 
Do you think we can see 
each other again? 
Wait. 
Aren't you going to go? 
I'll stay with you. 
What did she say? 
Is she going to 
wait with us? 
I feel a lot better. 
Of course. 
Where are you going? 
I'm not going to stay. 
You're not going to go? 
Don't try and trick me. 
Come back with us</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:53
