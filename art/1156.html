"I Think I'm Pretty Close To An Answer." "Hey, Babe, Come Here A Minute." "This Could Be It, Bud." "Lots Of Trash And Very Close To The Water." "You Think I Can Make It?" "What Do You Think, Bud?" "I Think You Got An Idea What To Do About It." "Well, Maybe You Could." "Mister, Have You Seen Any Of These" "Yes, Sailor, I'll Take That Draping, Please." "My Ship, The Queen Arrah, Ran Aground Here Last Night" "And I Just Got Them Back." "It's Just Over There In The Boat Yard." "If They Wasn't Right On The Bottom." "Do We Have To Remove It From There, Captain?" "I'm Afraid We Do." "Yeah, But I Have A Pretty Good Idea" "About Who's Probably Responsible For The Matter." "I Do Believe It Was Mr. Denny," "That Is, If You Know What I Mean." "Well, In That Case, Why Don't You Just Leave It To Us?" "I Can't Do That Either." "They've Already Got Them Both In Jail." "My Boat's Right In That Corner Of The Yards Over There." "The Two Other Boats," "They're Both Right Next To It." "You See?" "If I Can Get Them Two Into Jail..." "I'll Have A Few Sailors On My Hands" "That's Gonna Be Unnecessary." "Take This Fellow Over To The Yards, Captain." "We're Still Workin' On It." "It's Hard To Tell." "We're About Half Way Up." "Can't We Get Off And Take A Look At That Bottle?" "We'll Have To Wait Until The Morning, Mr. Rusk." "Let's Just Try One More Place." "The Bottom Here." "Could That Be The Right One?" "Yes, I Think It Could Be." "Hah!" "At Least I Don't Have To Rip It Out, Any Of You." "Why Do You Think This Is The Right Bottle?" "Well, The First Thing To Point Out Is" "The Fact That She's A Tavern Drinking Gourd." "Secondly, It's A Gin Bottle." "Probably Never Had Anything To Do With Anything Else Except..." "Minting Beer." "That's Exactly Right." "Whoever Placed It Down, Drinking Gourd" "Had To Know That It Was Being Used" "For A Drink That Wasn't Tequila." "Then, Let's Have A Look Around And See" "If We Can Find Some Place That Handles Only Gin." "Hey, Bud, What Are You Doing?" "What Do You Think He Was Doing, Bud?" "He Wanted To Get Them All Off Their Feet." "Bud, You're A Real Fool." "It'll Be Just As Hard To Dig It Out." "I Was Thinking Of Your Daughter." "It's A Beautiful Thing To Get Married On The Day She Turned Eighteen." "She Should Have That Feeling..." "Just Happening To Her." "Are We Gonna Be Here All Night?" "I Shouldn't Have Had That Beer So Early." "Oh, Stop It." "It Won't Make Any Difference." "Did You Ask Her Yet?" "He Won't Ask Me." "I Shouldn't Have Tried To Drag Them Here." "He Doesn't Want To Go, And I Don't Want Him To Go." "You Don't Want Him To Go?" "He's Our Son." "How Long Do You Expect Him To Be Allergic To You?" "He's Just Not Ready To Go And Marry Yet." "Just Because He Turned Eighteen, You Need A Place To Go And Marry?" "I'm Not Going To Let My Son Marry Someplace He Doesn't Love" "When I Know He's Got Enough Stuff Going For Him" "Right Here At Home." "Then It Seems To Me You're Doing All Right For Him." "He's The One That Said It All The Time, He's The One That Told Us" "Not To Come Here And Make An Announcement About This." "Well, Then He Was Going To Announce It Himself." "He Never Even Asked Me If He Could." "But He Has Asked You To Leave." "You Want Me To Be A Father To Him." "I Just Don't Want Him To Be A Father To Us." "I Know A Couple Of Good Men We Can Put Him With." "But, Dad, Why Don't You And I Go Out Someplace?" "We Might See A Movie, And You Could Introduce Me To Your Friends." "It Won't Make Any Difference, Bud." "I Still Wanna Know How You Two Would Feel" "About If Somebody Would Come In Them Rear Doors" "Or Around The Back Of The Barn." "I'm Not Talking About The Barn Anymore." "All I'm Talking About Is When We're At The Restaurant." "Oh, Come On." "You're Always Hiding Your Mouth And Looking At Me That Way When You Say" "That Kind Of Thing." "I'm Only Trying To Protect Your Future." "But There's Nothing To Protect, Dad." "They're Only Children They'll Be Back Here..." "In A Couple Of Hours." "Why Don't You Wait Until Then To Talk About This." "Then They Can Hear You Both Side By Side," "At The Same Time." "I Want My Two Ships Completely Out Of Sight." "I Want Them To Take Their Owners In The Cabana To The Bathroom." "You Know Something, I'd Like To Wash My Hands." "I Hope Your Boy's Okay." "I Don't Want Him To Miss This At All." "All Right." "I'll Bring Him In." "Bud, I Don't Know About You, But I'm Tired Of Being In My Bathroom" "And I'm Tired Of Being In The Backyard" "And I'm Tired Of Running For My Life." "When We Come To The End Of This Trip, I'm Gonna Bring 'Em All Back In" "And Make A Little Speech And Introduce 'Em Around." "We'll Get Them To See What We've Done" "So They Won't Be So Hard On Themselves." "Will You Make That Announcement For Me, Dad?" "I'll Do Whatever You Want, Bud." "What Do You Think About That, Bud?" "It's Not The Kind Of Thing I Ever Think About." "He Don't Think They've Got Any Money." "That's How It Looked To Me." "Did You Talk To 'Em, Bud?" "Yeah, They Wanna Go Into The Bathroom" "And Tie Them Up To Some Furniture Or Something." "I Shouldn't Have Done It." "I Think We All Ought To Go." "You Don't Have To." "I Want To, Bud." "Yeah, What About Raisin' A Speech, Dad?" "I Wanna Go." "All Right, Bud." "We'll Go And Talk." "All Right, Bud." "All Right, Bud." "Just Because They're Willing To Go In To Talk About This," "It Doesn't Mean Anything Yet." "I Wanna Go See Them Go." "Let's Take A Look." "Let's Watch." "Hey, Come On, Girls." "Come On, Now." "Come On." "They're Getting Slick, Bud." "Now, Here We Go." "Goodbye." "All Right, Bud, Here's The Door Right Over There." "It's Ain't Got No Lock On It." "Okay." "And Now, Here We Are Out In The Yard." "Hey, Now, How You Told 'Em?" "I Didn't Tell 'Em A Thing." "I Told 'Em You Couldn't Marry 'Em." "They Wasn't Listening To Me." "So What?" "It Was A Good Idea." "You Talkin' About That Slick?" "Well, What Do You Think I Told 'Em?" "What I Told 'Em Was The Kind Of Thing That They'd Go Out Of Their Minds" "If They Had A Couple Of Good Spins Around The Room." "They'd Be Running Around In Circles." "Yes, Sir." "I Had A Couple Of Good Spins And We're Gonna Stay Here." "Now, Bud, You Go Back In There." "You Want To Run Around The Room Like A Headless Chicken?" "You're Getting Better And Better." "And, Now, This Is The Tavern Door Right Over There" "And This Is The Inside Of The Tavern." "Here We Are At The Table." "Here's One Of Them On Each Side Of Him." "Look At Him Over There." "He's Laughing At 'Em." "That's What They're There For." "They're Laughing At 'Em Because They Want To," "Because They're Having A Good Time." "It's Too Late Now." "But, Dad, You're Telling 'Em What You Think I'm Gonna Say."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:32
