Instead 
of helping you feel better, your 
uncontrollable rage, caused 
another family's demise. 
How many more families?
You've already killed 4.
How long can you run before 
you run out of children?
My husband was 
such a wonderful man.
That's why I 
have to carry his soul. 
Yes, you've killed lots of people. 
That's all we do in life. 
You have to make your 
peace with it.
But, don't you think that 
would be better for those children?
Why can't you see that?
Because you've been brought 
up to think everything is a sin.
You won't listen to 
an outsider. 
I don't know how this is all 
going to end up.
My child has been 
through so much. 
But it's better that this family
is destroyed, than lives to 
see you punished.
But.. How would the child 
feel when he grows up?
That he destroyed 
his entire family.
That's all the 
family you have. 
What are you going to tell 
the other child?
How would he feel if you just 
let him down?
Would he ever understand?
No, you won't make it.
Don't worry. 
I'll always be there for you. 
I'll always protect you.
I'll stop you from doing 
anything reckless.
How many times will 
you run?
How many people will you kill?
How long do you 
want to be punished?
So you understand why your dad
did what he did? 
I understand why 
you did what you did?
Did your family ever have 
a bad day? 
Or did you just choose to be 
a selfish bastard and kill them? 
You didn't commit this crime.
You are the victim of your 
father's crime. 
You have no idea 
how this will turn out. 
This is not your fault. 
Let's talk to the prosecutor.
Tell him he's not going anywhere.
Then, you'll just have to kill 
me. 
They won't listen. 
But, you are going to have
to listen. 
My dad and 
my mother, got 
killed in a gun 
accident. 
We never even 
had a proper 
wedding. 
I had to look after
them. 
So I didn't go 
to school. 
But, I still did my 
best to follow 
their wishes.
Your punishment is worse.
What should I do? 
Don't worry. 
Just think. 
All you did was to defend 
yourself. 
There was a problem. 
The right solution was 
needed. 
That can be the 
right solution too.
We're all going to 
survive.
Now let's think about 
this. 
How long will you punish us?
How long will this continue?
When will you stop?
What should 
I do? 
Get help. 
Find a way to fix things.
Go talk to them. 
Let's make a new world. 
That's how we make things 
better.
Don't waste any more time. 
Go. 
You're going to have to go. 
Please. 
Please. 
You can save the child. 
Do you understand what you did
was wrong? 
Please, help me.
Sorry to keep you waiting. 
We got our hands on 
that killer pretty quickly. 
It took us a while to catch up 
with him. 
You are going to get help. 
We're trying to help you. 
Your children, your family. 
All of your loved ones.
They don't have to be burdened 
with your misfortune. 
If you take it into your own 
hands, your family will die.
When they find you. 
There is a way to fix this.
To start over.
Don't destroy your own life. 
You can't start all over again. 
Don't you see, you have 
to fix this. 
How would he feel?
You'll be given a sentence 
that fits you. 
How long do you think they 
would sentence you to?
Do you think he deserves to live
in prison for life? 
What about his kids? 
They should have a place 
in society. 
They should be able to live 
a normal life.
And, you need to change your 
attitude, once and for all. 
It is an accident.
You don't deserve to 
bear the punishment. 
You can't go around killing 
people. 
It doesn't matter how 
sick the law is.
Don't you understand? 
People who did 
a mistake. 
Who didn't have a family to 
bring him up. 
Those people, are 
a problem. 
Are they worse than you are?
Do you know the family's 
attitude? 
What have you done to them?
You don't know how 
they feel. 
What's going on in that house?
You don't know the circumstances
they have to live in. 
You don't have any idea. 
If you didn't know,
maybe, you would 
have felt the same thing.
I have a family too. 
If I knew how I'd come out 
of this.
No one has anything to do 
with you. 
Don't harm anyone.
What you're doing is wrong.
You should think about the 
children's future. 
You're hurting them. 
Don't you think that's enough?
What are you doing?
You've made your family's 
life a living hell.
Please, for your children. 
Please. 
You're wasting your time. 
Just kill him. 
Go ahead, kill me!
No, I don't want to die. 
Get out of here.
I don't want to die. 
No. 
Please, don't make me!
Let go of me.
I want to go.
Let go of me.
Please, no.
Don't hurt me.
Don't kill me!
Please. 
I'll give you the money.
I'll give you whatever 
you want. 
Please, don't make me die.
Don't make me die.
Let go of me.
No.
No!
I don't want to die.
Let go of me.
No. 
I don't want to die.
No.
Please.
Don't kill me.
Please, no. 
Let go of me.
It's better if we do this. 
If we do this.
It's not our problem.
Thank you, guys.
We are all living in a jungle. 
It's getting harder to find our
way. 
What do you do? 
How do we survive?
Please, let's survive.
This world is too cruel. 
The government is so unfair.
It's so cold.
It's so cruel. 
It's so cold.
It's so cruel. 
It's so cold.
It's so cruel.
It's so cold.
It's so cruel. 
It's so cold. 
I want to go back. 
I don't want to die.
You're dead. 
It's so cold. 
Please, don't make me die.
Let go of me!
Don't let me die!
Please don't make me die!
Let go of me!
Please, please don't make me die!
Please, please, please.
Please, I want to go.
Let me go.
Let me go!
I don't want to die. 
I don't want to die.
Let go of me.
Get out of here!
Get out!
Let go of me.
Get out!
Please, get out!
Please, please, please, 
please. 
Let go of me!
No!
Let go of me! 
No! 
I don't want to die. 
Please! 
Let go of me!
I don't want to die. 
Let go of me.
It's so cold. 
I want to go home.
It's so cold.
