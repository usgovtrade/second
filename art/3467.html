Matching the 'look'

This idea was inspired by a friend's husband's love for them!

Cats have a hard time with our scent. Since I was worried about my new addition to the house smelling like a "cat lady" I thought I would go with a natural scent that would match the curtains that I had from Crate and Barrel. I bought the fabric and went to Joann Fabrics to get the ribbon, lace, and fabric trim that I needed to cover the fabric on the wall.

My dear friend, Debbie, was generous enough to help with painting the wood frame. She worked hard and painted it to perfection! We used fabric paint to get the proper color. Using the left over fabric from the curtains made it a great way to save money since this cost was close to $50!!

My husband, Steve, took care of our new furniture while I was working on the curtains.

These curtains made a huge difference in the smell in our house. One of my favorite things is when Steve puts his hands under the sink and smells his fingers, it reminds me of our wedding day. We are celebrating 10 years this August! Now I am also able to get excited about a new baby because they are getting closer to having a new member of the family!

My "Sweet" "Stitch"

When we got married 10 years ago, I said I would love a white cat. One of my aunts used to have a white cat that she got when she was very young. He was called "Stitch" and he was her best friend. When she was sick, she told me that she loved me just like he did. So when she passed away, I said it was up to my husband, Steve, and I would name our white cat "Stitch".

I wasn't originally planning on adopting a white cat. Steve and I went to our local animal shelter to get a little kitten one time. The white cat, I told Steve, would make a great Christmas gift for my best friends baby. When we got home, we decided it would be best to get a young cat since we weren't able to keep it. The "white" cat looked like an "apricot", he was so adorable! As we were leaving the shelter, we saw a "tuxedo" cat. We were wondering what all the fuss was about. We ended up picking him and called him "Stitch". We told everyone that he was my favorite "lady cat".

We adopted Stitch on March 18th, 2003. He is a big boy now, he weighs about 7lbs. He is a sweetie! He has a very loving personality and he's very affectionate. Our first trip to the vet was very scary! Stitch got very sick with an extremely high fever. We went to the vet and they found that he had an abscess. This is when you get a little bit of inflammation at the opening of your intestines. Stitch was prescribed some very expensive antibiotics and pain medication. The only thing that Stitch enjoyed in the beginning was sleeping. One night when he was eating and trying to run off with his toy we realized that he didn't have enough energy to eat. We took him to the vet and they took blood. The next morning they told us we had to take him to see an eye doctor because Stitch had lost his right eye. We are still praying for Stitch. When he's awake he doesn't have any pain and will sit with us. When he is sleeping, he has a lot of pain. We make sure to keep his goggles on during the day so his eyes are protected from getting hit by any bright lights. Stitch is so scared of the light. We have to be careful of this when we change the channels on the television!

The eye doctor said that Stitch should recover. We now have to wait for his body to fully recover from the infection before we can put him to sleep! This all started on Stitch's birthday! What a blessing! I can't wait to see what God has planned for him! We still have a very happy boy! We wish Stitch the best and thank you all for praying for us!

Pink & Green...

I'm a huge fan of pink and green! They are my favorite colors. When I saw this cardigan, I just had to have it. I like to wear these types of cardigans around the house, especially in the spring and summer. I also love wearing them with dresses and jeans. I think the colors and texture work perfectly with my style. The sleeves on this sweater are the best, it allows for warmth without being bulky. My favorite thing about this cardigan is that it also looks beautiful in our bedroom!

My Red Neon Sweater

The last time I bought a neon pink and red cardigan, I had it on the sale rack of the store for about $3. This time I bought the same sweater at a different store for $19. I do not regret that $19! I love the texture of the fabric and the quality. I am so happy with the added bonus of having the sweater for a fraction of the cost!

The Scary Red Skirt

I am not a big fan of skirts, but when I was looking for something to wear with a blazer and some jeans, I saw this skirt and loved the neon orange color. It's my favorite color! When I put this on, I felt a little more confident than when I had been in my "granny" outfit of a flannel. I thought it was very cute, so I kept it in my closet for later use!

J.Lo's "Boots"

This is a pair of boots I bought a few years ago and have since then. I love them! I found them while we were vacationing on a cruise, but unfortunately I couldn't get them on the website. When I had seen the "Boots" from J.Lo's new movie, they caught my eye. When we went to the mall, I brought them with me, they were on sale for $49 and they were in my size! This pair of boots are so comfy and warm! My toes feel warm! They fit perfectly with what I'm wearing so I had fun putting them on. I have two children and this pair of boots will be very helpful for the fall and winter! If you love these boots as much as I do, you can purchase them in my webshop!
