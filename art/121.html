I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
everything.

Also, I'm planning on working as hard as possible.  I'm tired of watching 
the others having a great time and doing all the work.  My idea of a great 
time is watching you and David do the work, and letting the rest of the guys 
sit on their asses and enjoy it.

Your wife wants me to come home.  I'm not going to because I want to continue 
this party.  She also wants to come to California.  I don't have the 
equipment to haul my own plane and passengers back and forth, so if you need 
her to come to California to support me, just tell her she's got to come up 
and pick me up at some point.

I'll see you in 2 1/2 weeks.

Love,
Kevin

Hey Marde,

 First of all....who the hell is Chad Davis??  I am going to have to get a 
picture of him.  I looked in the want ad on Friday and I never saw a ad for a 
new guy.

I won't be in the office tomorrow.  I am taking off around noon.  I will be 
on vacation.  I am headed up to Portland for a week and a half to hang out 
with my wife.

I have no idea when I will be back in the office.  We will be up there until 
about the 4th or 5th.

Let's plan on talking at least twice a week.  

Kevin

Honey,

I don't know what I'm doing next Friday, so let's do it after you come back 
from your trip.  Which one is the new one in the new office?  That is the 
one I want to see.

You better make sure the pictures of Chad Davis are very clear.  Who's that 
Chad Davis that everyone thinks is so hot??

Have a wonderful time in Portland.  You deserve it!

Marde, 

It might be nice to get together and discuss the future before I leave.  You 
probably won't have a lot of time to do it while you are up there though.  
You want to grab a cup of coffee or something?

Talk to you later.

Hey Marde,

 I think we need to meet so I can at least get you up to speed on the whole 
Enron/EES thing.  What's going on with you?

You know I get all my email up here to the ranch.  I am going to start 
looking for an extra spot on my server and email it to you.  I need about 
500kb of space.  If that's a problem you could also email it to my dad's 
email account and he could print it out and hand deliver it to me.

Talk to you later.

I got the whole story on Kevin and I like it.  My lawyer and I are working on 
some confidentiality agreements right now.  I'll get back to you in the next 
10-14 days.

Where's your lawyer?  I really need to find somebody to help me figure out 
this whole lawyer and confidentiality thing.  My main concern is that he 
will find out what we're doing and that we won't be able to go any further.

All I know is that I'm supposed to get something in writing from the legal

I can't wait until I have to ask you for advice.  I'm almost positive I'm 
about to take a job I'm totally uncomfortable with.  I don't know what it 
will be like, but I'll find out in about 3 weeks.  I'll have my Blackberry if 
I can find a free email account.
