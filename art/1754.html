Kombucha Recipe

2 Tablespoons Sugar

1 Tablespoons Filtered Water

1 Cup Kombucha

Method

In a medium jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine sugar and water. Maintain the sugar to water ratio of 1:1. Allow the sugar to dissolve, and allow the water to boil briefly. Add kombucha and stir thoroughly to mix.

Cover the jar with an airtight lid. Let cool to room temperature, approximately 15 minutes. Wait 24 hours and check the taste. Add more kombucha or sugar if needed, and repeat this process until the desired kombucha taste is achieved. Let ferment at room temperature for 2 days.

Strain through a strainer lined with cheesecloth to remove any of the solid leftover sugars. Store in the refrigerator until your desired time. This kombucha may be consumed immediately or may be aged for a longer period of time to mature the taste. This can be placed in a smaller jar and fermented at room temperature for about 14 days.

We all know the amazing health benefits of kombucha, so why wouldn’t you want to add it to your daily diet. I love the fresh taste and health benefits. Our kids love it too. This drink is good for them, good for you, good for the planet. So drink up. And, if you want to buy some, head on over to www.nacho.mommaskombucha.com.

I love kombucha and make my own! I’m just wondering how long do I wait before serving or eating my kombucha? I have a glass I want to pour in it but don’t want it to become too alcoholic. I want to use it to make some yummy smoothies and iced tea with kombucha.

Hi Lisa, I always wait until I’m done fermenting it to use. It’s still tea but the alcohol content will vary depending on how much sugar you’ve added. The longer the kombucha sits, the higher the alcohol content. So a lot of the time, I like to drink it immediately, or the next day. If you’re nervous about alcohol content, I would suggest doing a taste test when you are done fermenting. If it doesn’t taste too much of alcohol, you can start to drink it immediately. And if you’re looking to use it in smoothies, you can leave it in the original bottle and add to your kombucha when you make the smoothies.

Wow! I just read this today! We’re on the exact same journey and are experimenting with all the flavors too. Can’t wait to start making this. I would love to be able to make my own Soda Stream too. What were they thinking? haha
