Wellbores are drilled in a variety of environments. For example, oil and gas wells are formed or “drilled” in both land areas, as well as offshore areas. Generally, an offshore wellbore is drilled using a jackup rig having a drilling unit, or “mast.” The mast includes a support structure or “derrick.” A drillstring is extended from the mast of the jackup rig and supported by the derrick. A drill bit is coupled to the end of the drillstring.
A subsea stack is also supported by the derrick. The subsea stack controls communication with the wellbore. Communication between the subsea stack and the drilling unit is generally controlled by a “well head,” which is a structure installed at the sea floor. The subsea stack receives information regarding the drillstring and sends instructions to the drilling unit.
The subsea stack is designed for use in certain environments, including shallow water, deep water, and ultra deep water. Each environment may require different communication capabilities. For example, ultra-deep water subsea stacks may include mud pulse telemetry. Drilling units typically include mud pulse telemetry capability because wellbores in ultra deep water typically include drillstring diameters ranging from about 5-6 inches and greater.
However, in shallow water conditions, high pressure systems, and other wellbore conditions, mud pulse telemetry is generally not available. For example, many shallow water wellbores have drillstrings with diameters less than three inches. In these environments, inductive transmission of data is preferred over mud pulse. One such method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,938,972, to Leuvering, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
As a consequence, multiple different types of drillstrings are used in different environments.
A variety of problems may arise from the use of different drillstring types in different environments. For example, operations, such as drilling or logging, may be required, but only one type of drillstring is available. As another example, it is desirable to use drillstring types in different environments to optimize efficiency and productivity of the drilling operation. For example, in shallow water conditions, non-mud pulse drillstrings are generally preferred.
A need exists for an improved method for using different drillstring types in different wellbore environments. Specifically, an improved method is needed for matching the drilling environment with the available drillstring type. An improved method is needed for using different drillstring types in the most cost-effective manner. An improved method is needed for using different drillstring types in the most reliable manner. As a consequence, productivity and efficiency of drilling operations is improved. A need exists for an improved method for using different drillstring types in different wellbore environments to optimize efficiency and productivity of the drilling operation.
The disclosed embodiments are directed to overcoming one or more of the shortcomings set forth above.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:46
