F. Murray Abraham stars in the season premiere of CBS’ “Criminal Minds.” It’s the week leading up to Halloween. There are monsters and masked men to deal with. Also, we see the team working on a cold case from 1992, an older woman found naked, raped and strangled, then left in a bathtub for dead. They have no idea why her throat was cut. This isn’t their first murder.

The Mentalist

Jane is a very busy woman. A group of criminals hold four police officers and one FBI agent hostage. A man is killed in a car accident, but no one in the police station believes he was drunk. The lead suspect in the murder, Jake McPherson, is the son of a former president of the hospital board. His sister, a doctor, helps him recover his memories from a blow to the head. This was a shocking episode in which everyone learned they could die. CBS, airing a repeat, was airing reruns on Monday, so this was original content for us.
