A woman gets her man, but loses a little of her independence for it.

“I’m a sex-positive feminist who has a sex-positive feminist boyfriend.” (Patches O’Houlihan)

“You know, the reason why I keep my love life hidden is because I don’t want people to be like, ‘Oh, why do you want to hide that from the world?’ But the reason why I have sex is because it’s fun, because it feels good and because I like it.” (Patrice O’Neal)

“I like not having a husband.” (Ricky Rebel)

“I still live with my dad because I can’t afford to live on my own. So I have a room that I rent out.” (Shawn Powers)

“I don’t need a man…I already had one.” (Sophie Reade)

“I’m still a virgin. I’m not proud of it, but I prefer being a non-virgin.” (Stacy Smith)

“I have a sex problem.” (Stacy Thorn)

“Don’t you think you’re getting old when your daughter is having sex?” (Tara Skjak)

“I’m really not much of a swinger. I tend to want to be the only person naked.” (Tina G)

“My biggest fear is not being independent. I am independent, but I will die if I have to get a man and be with him for the rest of my life.” (Travis Wall)

“I don’t believe in monogamy anymore. It is not the relationship for me.” (Troye Sivan)

“I’m still in a committed relationship with myself.” (Uncle Slam)

Miscellaneous and Offensive

“I want to see her naked before I pay for her.” (Alex Honnold)

“What turns me on is a girl looking me in the eyes, licking her lips…then I like being told how bad it is for me.” (Aaron Carpenter)

“I hate when guys text me saying, ‘You’re hot! Send a picture!’ I send a picture of my ass!” (Brittani Nichols)

“The older I get, the more I’m enjoying sleeping with a dude in his mid- to late-30s. He has a couple of kids, but he’s not a father. It makes you feel taken care of. Like, you’re the man. And it turns me on when you’re like, ‘You think I’m good in bed? Oh man, you were so good. You made me feel like the man I never was.’ That’s hot to me.” (Candace Von)

“I masturbated in my car in the grocery store parking lot…I was standing up.” (Chris Kelly)

“There are some places on a woman where you don’t want your kisses to end…on her lips. On the lips of a great love is where you want your kisses to end. I don’t mean to tell you how to make love. Only how to make love.” (Ernie Kovacs)

“If you want to do anal, you need to stop looking at porn with men in it. That’s the problem. You’re desensitizing yourself to pain.” (James Deen)

“My husband, the man, is an asshole.” (Kaytlin Bailey)

“He is my husband and I’m not happy. He wants me to be a mommy and take care of the house and that’s not what I want to do. He just thinks that he can control me, and it’s really, really annoying.” (Marlo Thomas)

“Why do you always have to tell me what to do?…No, you do not have veto power over me.” (Maya Kamien)

“I have a huge penis. My partner and I had sex the other day and I had never had an orgasm before. So she said I had to keep doing that thing until I got one…I like how it feels. It’s a big dick, and it’s like this is what it was made for, so it feels good.” (Olek)

“I just got out of prison. So I don’t need a man. I need a parole officer. And I got to get one of those really old, bitchy-ass bitches to be my parole officer…You know what it’s like in prison? It’s a fucking prison. There are some people who might want to be a prisoner because they want that prison experience. That’s not me. I was born free. I have a white-collar prison. I’m in Rikers…I wanted to do something bad, but I wanted to get caught, so I got on a train and went to the city and tried to pick up some black guy and then they arrested me…I could write a whole book about it, about how much fun it is to be bad.” (Omarosa)

“I had sex with my brother and I know it was wrong, but it’s not like I was thinking about the consequences.” (Padma Lakshmi)

“So, you’re single? I have some news for you, then. If a man is married, then his wife is a wife. But if you are single and a woman, then you’re just single. The rules change.” (Patrice O’Neal)

“I’ve had sex with a guy in a wheelchair, and it’s funny. You want him to be able to get out of the wheelchair and have a good time. When they can’t, you’re like, ‘Oh no, you can’t do that.’ And then he gets angry.” (Tori Spelling)

“I’ve been married for 13 years, and it’s the best thing I ever did…I’m a better person now. I was a shithead, and I was in the wrong. And I’m just glad that I get to spend every day with my children, my wife, and my friends. Now I’m a lot more fun to be around, and a lot happier. And, to be honest, I’m a better writer, too.” (Zelda Williams)

“I don’t date older women. It’s not my thing. I wouldn’t do it.” (Zoe Quinn)

“Are you kidding? Look at my boobs.” (Zoella)
