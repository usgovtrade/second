By: Eurekahedge, published: August 15, 2015

The National Council for Research on Women (NCRW) has submitted a comment on the draft framework for cord blood and hematopoietic stem cell research in the Philippines. The draft framework was released by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in July 2015.

The NCRW noted that the draft framework was based on an existing policy framework for embryonic stem cell research under the DOST’s bioethics and genetics unit, which excluded the broader field of research involving stem cells from cord blood and other sources.

“We understand that this is part of DOST’s continuing effort to have its own policy framework for all stem cell research,” the NCRW said. “But given the existence of the Presidential Reproductive Health Commission, we believe that the DOST should coordinate its effort in this area with that agency.”

The NCRW also noted that the policy framework had been released only months after the administration of President Benigno S. Aquino III established the Presidential Commission on Bioethics and Ethical Standards, which will conduct a review and analysis of the ethical and moral issues regarding stem cell research.

“Thus, instead of creating a framework for policy that reflects the prevailing social and ethical consensus, it seems that the drafters of the framework have chosen to impose their own personal preferences,” the NCRW said.

The NCRW pointed out that one of the DOST’s guiding principles was “maximum participation” in the process of research and was “a good indication of the DOST’s intention to reach a broad consensus.”

The NCRW also called for stronger public input on the policy framework, noting that the consultation process, conducted online in January 2015, “never really came up for actual discussion” due to the lack of public participation in the process.

“This points to the need for a robust and more structured public engagement effort on the part of the DOST as they undertake a far-reaching review of their policy framework,” the NCRW said.

A full list of the NCRW’s comments is available here.

S&P Global Ratings notes that, from a health perspective, umbilical cord stem cells are of interest because they can be used in tissue and organ repair, as well as for the production of red blood cells. Cord blood stem cells also are likely to have less ethical complications than embryonic stem cells, the ratings agency said.

“This is the reason that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved clinical trials involving cord blood for bone marrow transplantations, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have approved clinical trials involving cord blood for the treatment of certain diseases,” the ratings agency said. “Cord blood may also be a valuable resource in cases where the umbilical cord is not immediately available for stem cell harvesting.”

Umbilical cord blood is collected at birth, usually by a nurse or doctor in a hospital or birthing clinic. The donor consent process, including requirements for donating to the FDA’s cord blood bank, are similar to the consent process for a traditional blood bank.

Cord blood stem cells may also be collected from private companies that screen individuals for suitability as cord blood donors, such as ViaCord. Cord blood stem cells can then be stored in private cord blood banks, which the ratings agency expects could facilitate the development of cellular therapies.

In the U.S., the FDA currently requires that umbilical cord stem cells used for bone marrow transplantations originate from the U.S. and be transplanted within the U.S. FDA rules also prohibit financial remuneration for donor cord blood collections, although compensation is allowed for a limited number of medical supplies provided by a donor.

The Philippines Cord Blood Bank Foundation Inc. (PCBBFI), a private organization operating cord blood bank services since 1996, also operates a private cord blood bank called Gensia, which holds around 1,000 samples for stem cell preservation and future use.

The PCBBFI said it does not charge for cord blood services and is able to operate its cord blood banking operation successfully through the collection of private funds for research. The PCBBFI said it has received no government funding in the past decade.

In the Philippines, umbilical cord blood is collected and preserved at most local hospitals with the exception of private hospitals, said Dr. Erica F. H. Chua, Cord Blood Bank Foundation Philippines Inc. manager.

Umbilical cord stem cells are also commonly preserved in medical laboratories in the Philippines because of the lack of a comprehensive national program for cord blood banking.

The PCBBFI and its affiliate Cord Blood Bank, Inc. (CBCI) are able to provide services including collecting umbilical cord blood and banking umbilical cord blood stem cells for the international market. CBCI operates cord blood banking services in Taiwan and is currently building a cord blood bank in the United States.

The Cord Blood Bank Foundation Philippines Inc. (CBF) is an organization created by the cord blood bank industry under the order of the Department of Trade and Industry.

Cord blood banking in the Philippines is not regulated by government, although all operations of private umbilical cord stem cell banks are subjected to government regulation by the Department of Health (DOH). The CBF said it cooperates with and is a signatory of the Donor Bill of Rights, a movement to standardize cord blood donations in the U.S. The CBF said it currently provides donor counseling services to donors, and although it does not charge for cord blood collection, it charges donors for the storage of their cord blood.

In addition, the CBF said it has received funding from a foundation in South Korea for research and for the transportation of its donors’ stem cell samples.

The CBF and CBCI both operate cord blood banks and stem cell banks for newborns in addition to the PCBBFI’s cord blood bank and stem cell bank. The CBF and CBCI also have cord blood storage rooms for public and private cord blood collection.

The CBF holds the biggest collection of cord blood samples in the world and has the largest stem cell bank in Asia.

Philippine public cord blood banking facilities, including private banks, are operated by public and private banks. Public banks are operated by both the government and by private sectors. Private banks in the Philippines are operated by philanthropic foundations and by private hospitals.

The CBF holds over 2,000 cord blood units. It maintains a strong cord blood research program that is supported by a cord blood bank that collects nearly 1,000 additional samples and conducts stem cell research.

The CBF and CBCI each have cord blood and stem cell banks that operate 24 hours a day, every day of the week, with a separate cord blood storage room for donors. Both banks are also available by appointment and for collection, processing and storage of cord blood samples.

Private cord blood banks, including the CBF, maintain cord blood facilities that collect, process and freeze fresh cord blood stem cells using the “Gold Standard” method. The gold standard method ensures that there is minimal wastage and maximizes the number of viable cells that are being stored.

The public cord blood banks include stem cells that are processed and preserved in a cord blood bank. The cord blood is used to harvest stem cells from a donor and freeze the cord blood stem cells into a bank. Both private cord blood banks and public cord blood banks collect cord blood samples from multiple donors.

With the introduction of more private cord blood bank facilities, these facilities are competing with the CBF, CBCI and other public and private stem cell banks for more clients. Private cord blood banks do not directly compete with public cord blood banks, but they are an integral part of the health industry that is striving to provide the best in stem cell and cord blood services.

There are over 40 public cord blood banks in the Philippines, but there are no public cord blood banks that provide the gold standard stem cell storage facility. The gold standard cord blood storage facility is provided only by private banks, including the Cord Blood Bank Foundation Philippines Inc. (CBF) and Cord Blood Bank Inc. (CBCI).</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:47
