Kirby, who is the director of operations at STL, seems convinced that they are looking at a human being in a symbiotic relationship. 「I don’t believe that I was meant to get to this moment in time. No…」

Gantetsu has a look of horror and fright on his face, in a way, it seems that he wishes to believe it as well. Dr. Jones, however, states that he cannot know the mind of these extraterrestrials, as they likely had their own motivations and intentions for coming here.

Namely, that they may be interested in our planet, and what we have.

Kirby:「Human technology and civilization were advancing at a rapid pace…」Dr. Jones:「…They saw us as their next targets. And when they came to the earth…」Kirby:「…The world changed in an instant.」

(And with that, we are left to wonder what happened. The answer is, we don’t know, but we’ll never be able to figure out if we look back upon it. It is up to us to come to conclusions and learn for the future)

They had three primary motives for coming here, to find new specimens, conduct covert operations, or research.

Gantetsu asks, 「Dr. Jones, are they human or not？」Dr. Jones does not reply.

Gantetsu:「I also want to believe that, that they could be more than human.」

This is a major question that is floating around, but we may never know. However, what we can learn about them from this and the other alien species they found is that they are more than us, they are more intelligent, with a superior technology.

It would seem that this encounter, as far as they can tell, was their last. The question will always be, why? Why did they come here?

They are likely seeking more things, but maybe not. Maybe they are not interested in us as a whole, but more in something we have been toiling on for a very long time. This technology. 「There must be a reason…」

We are the product of their hand. And with that, the end of the article.

Thanks for reading this long and possibly difficult article. If you have any questions or comments, please do share with me.
