The vehicle is hit and deformed when a car accident occurs, the vehicle could be rolled over and the seatbelt could be unable to keep a person sitting in the seat. Furthermore, the accident vehicle often has a certain distance from the front part of the car, while a seatbelt is only provided in the front part of the car, and the safety function provided by the seatbelt cannot be kept. Furthermore, a child may be carried by a car seat of the vehicle. When the car accident occurs, the child may fall down from the car seat and move inside of the car. However, the child cannot be taken away by the rear part of the car, so that the safety function provided by the car seat cannot be kept. When these situations occur, the safety of an ordinary car driver or an infant could not be ensured by the ordinary safety belt.
In general, a safety chain is mounted in the rear part of a vehicle to ensure the safety of a car driver when the car accident occurs. However, when a car accident occurs, the car may be still kept on running and be hit and deformed after the safety chain breaks. Furthermore, since the car will be deformed after the safety chain breaks, the car is likely to be crushed or have a part of the car deformed by being hit by another car or hitting another object.
The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:01
