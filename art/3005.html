"It'll be all right." "I'm taking a huge risk here." "Yeah, with my life and with my job." "And with your reputation for punctuality." " I'm very sorry." " "Be happy we have a job for you. "" " Yeah, well, I'll do the best I can." " Yeah, so do I." "So, your job is to locate this man." "Let us know if you hear anything." "If I do hear anything..." "you'll know who to contact." "Yeah." "Well..." " I'm glad you feel that way." " Take care of yourself." "He's gonna give you a box." "Put it on your lap." "Can I start the car?" "Yeah, sure." "I can do it." "All right, that would be great." "Thank you very much." "What do we got?" "Oh!" "We got a small business, construction, plumbing, electrical, painting and the like." "This is a legitimate company." "You guys would be doing very well with this." "And we're the last company in L.A. that'll find a man like this." "Here's what we do." "Wonderful." "The only reason why you can't take the contract today is because we ran into a couple of hitches." "But if we can get the job done by 10:00 tonight, it's yours." "What are we waiting for?" "The bank is gonna transfer the funds at 3:30." "And this is why you pay us, this is our accounting department." "This is what keeps me up nights." "They're so careful to leave no trace... no fingerprints, no DNA, nothing to put us in jeopardy... like the men who don't deliver the box... we risk breaking the law ourselves." "We're just one more cog in the machine." "Hello." "I'm sorry, sir, I'm only allowed to take you through here." "No access to the roof." "Okay." "Don't worry." "If you're not gonna tell me what we're doing here." "I'm afraid I won't be able to, Mr. Barnes." "We're very old-fashioned." "We don't appreciate girls flashing their little titties at everybody who walks by." "So stop thinking of me as a pretty young man." "You are the last man I'm willing to do this for." "I am not an attractive man." "I'm old and ugly, and so are all my friends." "We don't know that about all your friends." "Hey, I'm not sure we're in the right place here." "I'm gonna have to go to the teller and get a manager." "Please don't go anywhere." "Yeah, we wanna make sure we take care of you." "Come on." "Yeah." "How's it going, Frank?" "The deal is going great, we're closing at 3:30." "It's a good deal." "I've seen better." "That's a good offer." "The key in this thing is the man in that box." "You guys ever heard of an Eddie Grant?" "No." "Not many people have." "He was the last person to see his father alive." "That much we know." "Where is he now?" "Well, he's supposed to be a friend of mine." "I wanna show you something." "I wanna put you in the car." "There's a gun in the glove box, would you take it out?" "I was a kid when I pulled this job off." "Took me six months to plan this one." "We needed to get this guy down south to help identify him." "And it didn't work?" "He was killed." "How'd you know the key in this thing was the man in the box?" "It wasn't his eyes." "They're soft." "He's got a lot of other problems, too." "You know, maybe he was just too damn pretty for this line of work." "He was supposed to be asleep at the time." "See this?" "This is the exact time... on his military records from two different armies." "What are you doing?" "We should get out of here before someone starts looking for these two guys." "No, look at his eyes." "This was taken a week ago." "He's looking at the sun." "I'm sorry about your friend, Mr. Barnes." "I need your help with something else." "What are you talking about?" "This is for a real estate deal I'm working on, that office building." "I was wondering if you could help me." "I need you to go to Albuquerque... with these two cops, the ones you were with this morning." "They have an Eddie Grant from the war." "And they're looking for his killer." "I thought I was out of this line of work." "I'm not gonna do this." "This job is not finished until it's finished." "You don't have to do this!" "Okay, then I'll give you whatever you want!" "This is a real job." "No, you do this job... and I'll call you a cab, because you've got one foot in the middle of nowhere." "That's not a man, that's a boy." "I've been around a few, and I can spot one." "You and your friend better hope you're on the right side of the line." "We'll be in touch." "What if I don't want to go?" "Well..." "then I guess I'll just have to punch you out." "Mr. Barnes?" "Yeah, I'm still here." "I'm supposed to be in Albuquerque, New Mexico." "I'll probably have to stay here a few days, so I need some help." "I've got a real estate deal I'm working on." "I have to take these two officers." "They're from L.A." "There was a crime, but they're not interested in that." "All they want is some guy named Eddie Grant." "His picture's on the back." "Can you help me?" "Eddie Grant was my friend, but he's been dead for 35 years." "I never even met him." "Where did he die?" "Newcastle, England." "Did he die before the war?" "How long you expect me to sit here answering these dumb-ass questions?" "Are you ready?" "Yeah, I'm ready." "You're gonna be all right." "We're gonna do some business." "Now, I want you to get up." "Come on." "Come on." "I ain't gonna hurt you." "Come on, get up." "Get up." "Oh, shit." "Let's go." "Come on." "I don't know about this." "Just relax." "It's gonna be all right." "I'm gonna be gone in five minutes, I promise you." "Okay?" "All right, this is a good opportunity for you, but you get in the car, you don't say anything." "Just relax." "All right?" "Let's go." "So how do you think it's gonna go?" "You know, I mean, he can kill a man from a distance of 200 yards." "What makes you think he's gonna make a deal?" "I've seen stranger things happen over a hot stove." "Now what could make sense out of this?" "I don't know." "But the kid's in a boxcar, so why don't you shut up and leave me alone?" "Yeah, sure." "I'm sorry." "I'm really glad I met you." "I'm glad I got the chance to know you better." "All right, we're gonna look around, then go." "Is that a deal?" "Go on, do some shopping." "Come back in half an hour." "Right." "How far?" "It's about 20 miles." "We'll be back in time." "How far?" "About 20 miles." "Come on." "I don't want to wait." "Come on." "I don't want to wait." "Wait for me!" "I don't want to wait!" "Shut up, you." "Get the fuck in here." "Shit, man, it's gonna get hot in here." "All right, move over, I'll drive." "I got one question for you." "You ever put your dick in a piece of pussy and let her kick you out?" "No, that would be like putting your dick in a cactus." "I know what a cactus is." "It's not like I've been sitting in one for three days now." "That shit hurts." "Look, if you're nervous, just let me do all the talking." "And I'll tell him you got bursitis." "What's that?" "Some joints get to hurting from arthritis." "If you don't believe me, I got pamphlets." "I had to go to three different pharmacies." "I was lucky to get those." "Just like that." "You're nervous." "No, I'm not." "Yeah, a little bit." "Man, you must really believe in the boss, boy." "I ain't got no choice." "He believes in God, too." "Come on, man."
