Karen has done everything right. As a child, she was taught to put others first. Then she met Kylen. He looked at her like no one else ever had and made her feel things she never thought possible. Even as a young girl, she could feel the attraction between them building. But then he betrayed her and broke her heart. Twenty years later, the nightmare of losing Kylen still looms heavily over her, along with the threat of a force more devastating than any storm...and the discovery that the man she'd let into her heart is the enemy.

Publisher's Summary

A very cute and humorous short story based on a true story, the way one life-changing event can completely alter the entire course of another person's life.

Brynn has a pretty comfortable life. She and her husband own an art gallery in a great location. She has a couple of cute kids and a decent job. And she gets to sleep in every morning, even though her husband wakes up at five every day so he can start running. Then one day her husband walks out on her. She figures it's just a temporary fit of pique - something he'll grow out of. So she gets busy filling her free time.

Her husband's reaction is even more surprising to her than his abandonment - but it still leads to them reuniting and starting a new life together - where he can be an even better father than before, and she can be a mom with fewer headaches.

Warning! May Contain Cute, Love, and Humor!

Story

Good reading material

I am a person that likes reading light reading material. This book was good for me. I could not stop laughing. Great story written by Susan Mager. She does a fantastic job with the flow of her writing. I could imagine the character of the lead. It was an easy listening to, yet kept you glued to the pages. Excellent story and characters.

A story about making a family

This is a story that takes a look at what it means to be part of a family. It is sometimes difficult to love and accept someone who is also a part of the family. I didn't know where this story would go but I enjoyed it.

Short stories I really liked

These stories were cute and short but it also made it difficult to put them down. At the end of the stories, they ended abruptly, I was hoping that it was the end, I liked the way they ended but it was a little disappointing because we did not get to see them again.

I just listened to this story again... It was the best!

The story about Brynn was just so heartbreaking. I enjoyed hearing about the wonderful family the author had. I just thought it was interesting that someone had this happen to him and how it changed his life. I loved the relationship between the husband and wife and I liked how the lady wanted a divorce because she thought that he did not love her anymore. Overall, it was a sweet story and it was well written. I really want to get more of her work. This one was very emotional and very funny. You can't not love the fact that he gets to come in from a run... with a chocolate bar. It is the small moments that make all of the difference. I want to read the next one and I have not even listened to them. She is an awesome writer.

This is a great book

Fairy tale turned down a side street. And that's it, turned around... I don't know how I missed these great stories about married life. What a treat. And the one about the guy who starts running. How clever. You cannot not fall in love with the guy running toward his kids on Halloween. Brynn. I loved Brynn, I loved my husband, and I cried because he's better than Brynn's husband, and I'm glad they all work it out. You're a great writer, Susan.

Another one of Mager's masterpieces.

This is another one of Susan Mager's great pieces. The short, sweet, and true stories about lives and love are truly enjoyable reads. Ms. Mager gives insight into everyday life of a family, and is a great reminder to us all to cherish what we have in life. I'm always looking for a new Susan Mager book</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:45
