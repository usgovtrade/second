Our story begins with a boy with no name, who appeared in a cave, one
day, and fell down a deep well. I was there the day of his birth, and had but just
escaped from the womb, and had no part in his destiny. I stood by the side of the
boy's cradle, looking on him with amazement; but as he was healthy, and I did
not think he had been hurt, I thought he would be called the Baby, and had nothing
else to give him. I had not time to consider: a great man rushed in and commanded
the nurse to go. It was not for me to know who was the father; and I had more
important matters to think of, as will appear in the sequel. The nurse took the
infant in her arms, wrapped him in the only present she had at command; which
was her petticoat; and went out into the rain, that beat against the window. As
I turned to go with her, the nurse gave me a parting glance, which seemed to say,
'My blessing, too, you have.' The boy had one black eye; and his lips were pale,
and quivered as if he were in pain. I saw it was his part to suffer. The cry
that the Baby made attracted my notice.

When I looked into the cradle, I said: 'What a shame!' I wanted to make another
little creature cry. I found fault with the nurse for laying the Boy in my
cradle, but I could not scold her; and that vexed me. I was very angry; but I
thought my anger was caused by jealousy. I saw the boy was cross, and as I was
not angry with the Nurse, I was sure that the Baby was cross; and yet I knew
nothing of nursing. I wished that I could be sent to the country; there I would
see how a child is to be looked after. A day or two after this, some one told
me that the boy's name was Lazarus; and then I guessed who the Baby must be.

But time went on: days passed, and a new name was added, until one day I heard
that a little sister was born. That was the last straw. 'It's all over,' said
I, 'with the nurse; and that's the reason she never sent the babies out into the
world, to see if people would come to trouble them.'

Houses and farms have their stories; so have people, though they are of less
consequence. I shall tell the stories of a few of the persons in this house.

Chapter 2. The story of Old Tom. The baby was not given to me: he was given to
Martha to take care of. And Martha went to nurse the first child, and wept, when
she took her baby home. Old Tom, the carter, had a son, and he had been in the
army, and had lost his right arm. He took a great interest in his little son;
and it would have been well if his sister had not interfered. She used to say
that the baby's father never came to see him; but that was because he could not
find the way to the house.

I told Martha this was wicked, and it was not respectful to the father: but
she was so positive about the right, that I took my baby to old Tom. I went
straight to his cottage, and said, 'Mr. Tom, here's a baby for you;' and then
I looked as innocent as I could, that I hoped he might be forgiven.

The old man looked kindly at me. He was much impressed by the child's beauty,
and asked me how much I charged a year for taking care of him; but Martha would
not hear of this. I walked away slowly; but Martha's voice followed me; and I
felt sure the old man would find out all about the arrangement.

I am sure that Martha's feelings were good: she meant to serve the father and
mother to whom she was attached, and yet she had no influence with Martha. When
I was with old Tom, I used to talk as loud as I could, to the detriment of
the baby. I think it was out of jealousy; but I liked old Tom; he was a good
fellow. I went to his cottage again; and this time Martha said, 'She did not
believe that if Mr. Tom wished it, it would make him worse, if she sent the
boy for a little walk.' I went alone, after this.

I thought it my duty to be sentimental, and I began to cry when I reached
old Tom's cottage. He was sitting by the fire, reading. 'My eyes are very bad,
little girl;' he said; 'give me a kiss.' But I found out afterwards that he
meant for some other reason.

I took the baby; he was as white as a sheet, and had been weeping; and,
indeed, he had a good cry before I came out of the house. It was a cold
March day, and I had walked a long distance, in order to do as Martha asked.
I remember walking, with the baby, into the kitchen, and there was a fire; and
there was a beautiful white cloth on the table; and there was a brown jug full
of milk for the baby. And the old woman said: 'Ah, Martha! this is a poor-looking
baby. Who does he belong to?'

I could not tell, at the moment; but the old man was there; and he explained
that the baby was left by one of the officers in the army. 'His name is Lazarus,
she can't call it for my sake.'

Martha was in the room, but not to take care of the baby: she began to cry.
She knew better than anyone else how I had longed for a child. 'I would give
anything to be able to nurse it,' she sobbed. And the old man, I could see, was
rejoiced to have the baby taken from my charge; and I knew very well he meant
that I should give it to Martha. I did not say a word; but, as soon as I
could get the baby in a comfortable way, I hurried away.

The snow came in the night, and I found it hard work to keep the baby warm.
He had no other clothes than the nurse's petticoat. The snow was drifted high
by the side of the house, where the cow used to be tied; but, when she was
taken away, I found the poor little fellow had been used to reach the poor
beast's milk, for, in the morning, the snow had been pushed back again.

I shall never forget the scene of horror; for I had to take the baby there,
in the night, as soon as the snow fell. 'Have you tied the cow up?' I asked
the old man, and he said, 'No; she has taken fright.'

I went to old Tom's cottage, the next day. He was very kind to me, and the
old woman was full of kindness and sympathy. The baby was quite well. I was
not in a mood to feel happy: it was not my baby, nor my home; so I went away,
alone, to cry.

I heard of some of the old people, who had not long to live, and I went to
one of their houses; but the old man was so ill that I knew he would die within
a very short time; and I wished to see the baby before he died. The old woman
found the baby crying. She came to me. 'Here's a baby.' I asked her if it was
the child. She said, 'Yes;' and I went to the old man and saw him; he had not
changed his position, he was leaning against a piece of furniture, as though he
had been asleep. 'She's a nice baby, isn't she?' he said. 'Yes, she's a
pretty baby,' said the old woman. I did not care to see the old man again, so
I went away.

I thought Martha had been left all alone with the baby. 'I must go and see the
old man. I cannot go without a message,' I thought, and I could not find the
man. I suppose his housekeeper had taken charge of him; and that is why the old
man took the petticoat off the boy.

I was very near to the old man, and he could not hear what I was saying; but
I saw Martha go to her husband, and stoop down to kiss him; and, in a minute,
she pulled away the bit of stuff that he lay upon; and the old man sighed, and
said, 'She's a good girl; and the worst is over, and she will be happy now.'

After this I was near to the house of the old man, whenever I met him. 'How
are you, sir?' he would say. 'Did you think I was going to die?' I thought he
would never die. But I would not allow myself to look into the future, or
meddle in</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:16
