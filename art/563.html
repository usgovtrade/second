“Huuu-ahhh!” cried out, as he felt a finger on his butt.

Quiggly’s body shuddered as he turned around. He was about to shout when he saw what was standing behind him. That’s right, it was an ugly girl with a freckled face, pigtails, and a dress with a short skirt that was torn up the side.

“Gah!” screamed Quiggly, but he was too late as he was swallowed up by the nighttime darkness.

“Huuuuu-aaahhhh!”

Once again, Quiggly found himself buried in the ground, and he did his best to stop himself from screaming with the same vigor as before. He didn’t want to wake the whole town.

Finally Quiggly got out of the coffin, and he was glad to be back in the light. After a few moments of coughing, Quiggly got on his feet. He was dazed, but managed to take out his glasses, before he spied that the body was gone!

Just as Quiggly took in his surroundings, the bell at the entrance of his classroom rang. That would explain his students walking in just then.

Then the bell rang again, which meant it was time for him to begin the lesson. He must be in the correct classroom, but what about the body?!

“What? You got a problem, kid?” bellowed one of the kids.

“I don’t know,” said another one. “The body? She’s missing it…”

“Weird….” thought Quiggly, but it was better not to jump to conclusions as this was after all a place called Weird Land. He didn’t even have a camera!

Quiggly took out his trusty notebook to begin the lesson, and he was just about to say ‘hello’ to the class when he was interrupted by an even more annoying sound.

“Bzzziiiiinnggg!”

Quiggly paused in mid-sentence, just in time to see a ball of string burst into the room, and he just knew that something interesting was about to happen.

Just then the door was torn open, and a girl with red pigtails wearing a yellow dress that was ripped all up the side stepped into the room, and with her was a boy who Quiggly was sure was someone from the school.

The girl’s name was Slimp, and the boy’s name was Muffin.

Their hair was messy and they were both sleepy-eyed. There was also a third person, and that was a clown with black eyes. It was all that Quiggly could do not to freak out and fall on his rear end. It was actually a good thing that Slimp knocked over a stool to scare away the clown.

“Oof!” Slimp screamed and leapt to one side.

Muffin was too slow to do anything, so Quiggly took out a stick to beat the clown. The kids were shocked by his strange behavior, but once he started to feel the beatings coming their way, they joined in the beatings.

Muffin was pretty strong and took the stick in one hand. He couldn’t feel anything until after a few hits, but Quiggly made him do it a few more times.

When Muffin was about to say something, Quiggly just got in the way and hit him on the head with the stick.

“Oh my gosh! Stop!” screamed Slimp, but before anything bad could happen, Quiggly took out a notebook and handed it to her.

“This will keep me from doing anything stupid.” said Quiggly.

It took a few moments, but Slimp gave in, but she didn’t look very pleased. Quiggly then made the students take out their iPads and then they all started to play iFish on the iPads.

Just like that, the night was over. Before anyone knew it, Slimp and Muffin had to get to school, but first they had to take off their Halloween costumes. Quiggly gave them a chance to talk after they returned to the school’s classroom.

“So what happened, Slimp?” asked Quiggly.

“That teacher? He didn’t even act mad when I took out the class. It was so weird, that he didn’t even turn to the class after that boy said something about a body. He didn’t even see it when I put my bag with the sheet in it on the window sill. But I think it was because I was acting so weird.”

“Maybe,” said Quiggly, while he was scribbling something in his notebook, “You were acting so weird that he had a blank mind.”

“Huh? But he’s an adult…”

Quiggly finished writing something down, then he looked up to see Muffin. He hadn’t had a chance to talk to him at all, so he just had to wait until he got the chance.

“Oh, you didn’t notice at first, but….”

Quiggly didn’t really listen, because he was trying to think of what to write down. Just then, Muffin’s eyes got big.

“I thought you were dead!” said Muffin.

“I kind of was,” said Quiggly, chuckling. “But I’m okay.”

“Heh, a body, huh?” said Muffin. “I don’t think anything will happen, but if you do, I’ll help.”

“…Thanks.”

“So how’d you get out of that?”

“Gargh! I can’t even explain it, but he got out too!”

“It’s a good thing you caught on to that body. With his head in the grave, the body would have been on its own, for a long time. I’m sure he was too afraid to run away.”

“Right,” said Quiggly.

By then the bell rang, so they had to get to class, but it was only Muffin that went, because Slimp had lost something.

“Oh, you didn’t know…? I guess it’s too late now, but….”

Muffin put on his backpack, and then he closed the door behind him. They had finally met each other. That meant that they were finally friends. That was odd, but Quiggly was happy about it.

Finally the teacher said the night was over, and he called it an early morning. He told them to close their eyes, so Quiggly put his notebook away.

It took awhile for everyone to get back to their normal lives, but they’re back to normal. The teachers were all happy.

“Hello everyone!”

Quiggly was surprised to see the principal walking around his school with a camera.

“Welcome back!”

He told Quiggly that they went to the cemetery to check for clues, but there was nothing. It was weird. They were going to go and question the owner of the body next time.

There was a lot of work to do in class, but Quiggly didn’t have time for it, so he only had to teach the class about ghosts and monsters and the supernatural.

After the class, Quiggly met Slimp and Muffin. He’s glad that they’re back to normal.

“We got him to walk to school without telling anyone.”

“Yeah. Now I feel like I’ve been in the grave again.”

“You’re welcome.”

Muffin opened his mouth and looked at Quiggly, but before he said anything Quiggly’s eyes shifted. He realized that it was probably coming.

“Um, Muffin? Can I borrow that red mask you made for Halloween?” asked Quiggly.

“Sure, but I don’t think I can help you with it if you can’t see.”

“It’s okay. Just make it simple.”

“All right. I’ll make something simple. But it will take a while. It looks like you’re really going to make that mask. And now I really want to help you out. You’ve worked really hard on the mask!”

Quiggly smiled.

“Hey, Muffin? Are you busy after school?”

“Yeah. I have a lot of research to do.”

“Oh, okay. Well, I have to go now. Bye!”

Muffin smiled at Quiggly, and he and Slimp started to head to the forest that was right behind the school.

Quiggly thought that it was already evening, but it was only mid-afternoon. He had finished making his mask and now he was taking a long nap.

There wasn’t much time until midnight, but after being in the grave for a while, he was sure that there would be more things that would be different.

It took some time to figure out what</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:44
