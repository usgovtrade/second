<R4v3n> The topic says it was last seen Fri Apr  8 00:38:55 2007
<pawalls> I think I've figured out how to do what I want.
<pawalls> I put /home/foo on my ext3 partition and created a symbolic link to /home/foo/var/www in /var/www/html and everything's great.
<pawalls> So, I'm an idiot.
<pawalls> Doh.
<R4v3n> No one reads the topic
<nalioth> R4v3n: but they do read scrollback
<pawalls> And stupid me didn't think of creating a link from /var/www/html to the home folder for my httpd server.
<pawalls> So, do you guys have any advice on where I could ask a better question?
<R4v3n> Maybe in ##linux
<pawalls> K.
<elkbuntu> R4v3n, not always the case
<R4v3n> yeah
<R4v3n> I know
<R4v3n> but it's just a small channel
<nalioth> R4v3n: so join it and ask your question
<pawalls> Yeah.
<R4v3n> lol why would i need to join ##linux
<pawalls> Hmm.
<nalioth> R4v3n: have you found all the options at <#ubuntu-offtopic> ?
<pawalls> Any idea why they would think it was funny for an entire sub-forum to be empty?
<R4v3n> That does sound quite empty
<R4v3n> Well
<R4v3n> I got into ##linux
<R4v3n> #ubuntu ##linux ##hardware ##networking ##philosophy ##offtopic ##bash ##unavailable ##windows ##c##java ##c++ ##c##c ##embedded ##electronics ##freenode ##gnome ##gnome.general ##gnome.help ##gnome.offtopic ##gnome.support ##isp##mac ##windows-networking ##security ##samba ##server ##programming ##programming.portuguese ##c##java ##c++ ##c##c ##cpp ##networking ##politics ##philosophy ##opendbox
<R4v3n> oops
<R4v3n> wrong window
<pawalls> lol
<pawalls> I'll ask again.
<pawalls> Would anyone be able to point me to a place where I could ask questions about the Ubuntu forums and their moderation policy?
<nalioth> pawalls: i don't have the foggiest idea
<nalioth> i do believe there is one for the admins, but you're most likely gonna get spammed there
<pawalls> Nah. I've been around them long enough that I just need to ask them one question.
<pawalls> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=293620 <-- This is the post in question.
<nalioth> i have no clue what it is you want  to know about
<pawalls> It's kind of a 'help wanted' thread...
<pawalls> but I'm just looking for one of the mods or forum staff to take a look at it.
<nalioth> i have no clue
<R4v3n> oh wow a ubuntuforums admin lol
<nalioth> R4v3n: yes, one of the admins
<pawalls> I guess the only place to ask is the forum itself.
<pawalls> If not... then I guess I need to go to ubuntu's IRC council.
<nalioth> pawalls: it is not appropriate for #ubuntu
<pawalls> I know.
<nalioth> pawalls: so, why ask here?
<R4v3n> No
<R4v3n> I asked here because he said no one reads the topic
<nalioth> R4v3n: but your original question was not an Ubuntu issue
<R4v3n> lol i know
<nalioth> so it was moved, but is not an Ubuntu issue any more
<R4v3n> i just didnt want to ask it in a more appropriate channel
<R4v3n> im gonna leave
<R4v3n> k bye
<pawalls> Bye R4v3n
<pawalls> Thanks again.
<nalioth> np
<pawalls> Good night.
<nalioth> no night, morning, whatever
<R4v3n> yea i know lol
<R4v3n> but i did just wanted to leave it open here
<R4v3n> im gonna run
<R4v3n> if anyone needs me
<R4v3n> g2g bye for now
<pawalls> heh. 'Night everyone.
<nalioth> night, pawalls
