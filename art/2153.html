Her second solo CD, 'I Don't Know Why', was released in 2008 and is her first music release to feature solely her vocals, as a co-producer and a co-writer of the album. In July 2008, she launched the 'Karma & Mystique Tour', playing in front of 2000 people at the Meredith College, Torrington, Connecticut and in another 1000 at The Stone Pony, Asbury Park, New Jersey.

In 2010, as a member of the group The Sick Chirping Dove, she released her third solo album, titled 'The Bird Will Fly The Coop'. This album was an eclectic blend of styles such as reggae, folk, blues, and classic rock. Soon after it was released, 'The Bird Will Fly The Coop' rose to #3 on iTunes' Top Albums and quickly gained the attention of the national media. In addition to its original songs, 'The Bird Will Fly The Coop' features songs by The Staple Singers, The Beatles, Bob Marley, and others.

In 2011, as a songwriter, Meredith launched two new online music projects called 'Kokoloskoolooloo.com' and 'Mikisounds.com'. These sites feature her solo, new and used songs for free download.
