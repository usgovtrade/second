I would love to hear an interview on this topic from Phil Duffy. He's a
clinical psychologist who did the research on this study:

Another thing that never seems to be discussed is that long-term use of
antipsychotics almost certainly comes at the cost of cognitive decline. This
isn't really surprising, since we now understand that these drugs actually
directly affect areas of the brain that are strongly associated with those
tasks. It would make sense that they have permanent effects on cognition.

It seems like an obvious conflict of interest that so much research money is
being paid to doctors who also profit from those drugs. Surely we can find a
better way to investigate the effects of neuroleptics on healthy people.

The doctors doing the research are paid $40-70/hr. You can find some
ineffective antipsychotics for less than $20 a pill. There's nothing wrong
with that, it's the free market at work.

I'm not a psychiatrist or a mental health professional of any sort, but I've
been observing psychiatry in the US from the other side, having worked for
large government healthcare organizations for more than 15 years. When I first
started hearing about this sort of thing happening, it came out that people in
the mental health field didn't know anything about this and it was an
afterthought to just order them from their suppliers. But now, it seems, at
least in California, that everyone's on it.

When the government started passing laws about this, it was not to make people
think they are better than other people. It was to enable people to live
productive lives with as little difficulty as possible -- that is, enable them
to be as productive as the average population without being "crazy". Since
that's exactly what many of them would like to do, they should not be punished
or stigmatized because they decide they want to use the medication.

Now, clearly the people being punished are other people: "normal" people who
might get unlucky enough to come into contact with a mentally ill person. (The
one upside to the drug problem is that it causes many of us in the US to
discover that many people live normal productive lives with mental health
problems.) These people were never on these drugs to begin with. They were not
aware of this, and it would not help them, so the argument is that they
somehow failed to exercise self-control.

Now, what does that mean, other than to say that they don't believe in the
value of the medications? Do they just not believe in the value of people with
mental illness? Or did they just not believe in this drug because they heard
it caused psychosis? Do they think "causes psychosis" is an inherent property
of some drugs, in which case why is it only this one drug that's causing the
problems? Or does it mean "causes problems for people who are already crazy"?
Is it wrong to use this drug for people with schizophrenia? Or is it only
wrong to use this drug _for the first time_ for people with schizophrenia? If
it's wrong only for people who have schizophrenia, that means that these drugs
are being taken by all sorts of people with mental illnesses -- anxiety,
depression, and PTSD. What do we do with all the people who are taking these
drugs who weren't sick when they started them? Do they get to take them until
their problems are over? Can they stop when the side effects start to be
serious? (Remember that the side effects of these drugs are sometimes serious,
but most people have serious side effects to drugs other than anti-
psychotics.)

So here we have a situation where the medications are not just approved, but
actively promoted by the federal government. But yet some large percentage of
the population doesn't think they should be in use, because they don't see
their target population as deserving. But the other option is to let them take
this risk and hope that nothing happens.

The risk is that these drugs have terrible side effects, with the ones that
have killed so many people being among the ones promoted most strongly.

What we need to do is allow people to make their own decisions, and stop
making laws with the objective of using the laws themselves to push some
political agenda that everyone has to follow.

The idea is to help people help themselves.

We've seen this story before, about 20 years ago when "we" decided that people
were basically addicts for life, and "drug rehab" was the only choice. We're
now living with the results of that policy.

I don't know about it specifically, but I see a trend in the direction of the
society deciding to be more intolerant in general. So you can't offend people,
and in addition you are required to be politically correct.

If one did things in the past not according to the rules of politeness --
didn't say "God Bless you" when sneezed on, had an offensive or racist opinion,
spoke ill of women or homosexuals. Would get in big trouble. The attitude was
"just ignore it, it's a one off, someone will forget, and next time they'll be
sure to behave correctly.

Nowadays if you say something that doesn't fit the approved agenda, there will
be repercussions. I remember the controversy about the TV show South Park. It
is a cartoon comedy program in many ways similar to Family Guy, so what could
be different. First of all it aired on Comedy Central, not Fox or a CBS or NBC
affiliate. So, it is not protected by broadcasting guidelines and censorship
and FCC rules.

It had a skit where a character was trying to "convert" people to Mormonism,
they wanted to baptize him. The Church of Latter Day Saints sued Comedy Central
and got an injunction against the airing. Just the thought of South Park
running on that network is now illegal.

It has had a lot of skits in the past about topics that are considered taboo
by liberals, conservatives or both. The show got in trouble for a skit about
Jesus, which had a character saying "Let's just say his parents got
tetragonaphobics" referencing mental disorders (tetrisphobia being apparently
quite funny). Another skit had him dressed as the grim reaper and saying that
if he had a day off he would "off" people. And now, he's suing Netflix over
South Park. Now just saying in your mind that religious stuff might not be
funny on a cartoon show is already in trouble. How is that a different than
having to call some one a "jerkoff" and get arrested.

    
    
      Comedy Central, its parent company Viacom Inc, the writers and South Parkâ€™s distributor, had no comment on the legal action.

We got to a point where you can't do anything without risking your business.
Imagine the number of people in charge of content censorship in a company
like Google, Facebook or Netflix. They are probably really good programmers
that know their stuff and can sniff things out. How would you or I fare as a
developer in that environment?

No thanks. Give me my 20 years of neuroleptic medication.

The side affects of antipsychotics in my case were terrifying.

I ended up having to take Risperdol and Seroquel to combat the withdrawal
symptoms.
