"You're our only hope." "You're our only hope." "Only one thing I ask in return." "What's that?" "I get to kill the boy." "No!" "What is it?" "It's a baby." "But, Mommy, it's a really ugly baby." "Nuh-uh!" "We are giving it a bottle." "Really?" " Yeah." " And it's alive?" "Alive and well, and living in my butt." "I figure it's yours." "Oh, gee, I don't know." "Oh, come on." "Look how cute he is." "Oh, that's too much ickiness!" "I'm gonna be sick." "He's all covered with... ugh!" "He doesn't look like me at all." "No way." "Okay, maybe it's a little like you." "Look how happy he is now." "See?" "He's got that look that says it's time to eat." "And the food talks, too!" "Listen." "Ooh!" "Words!" "Oh!" "Words!" "Oh!" "Great, mom." "He's not a mute." "Now he's repeating everything you say." "You might as well have a great big sign on your forehead that says:" "I have no penis!" "And my mom's so fat... my bed might fall off the floor and crush her." "Oh, honey, you think your mom's fat?" "Wait till you see her after the baby's born." "What's that supposed to mean?" "He's mocking me!" "Mock this!" "You're mocking me!" "Yeah, that's it!" "That's it!" "Yeah!" "And this one... is for Billy!" "No, no, no." "For every time you made me get out of that trash can when you had me in there in college!" "Aah!" "Ohh!" "No, no, no, come on." "You're Billy." "You're..." "Yeah!" "He's mocking me!" "You're mocking me!" "He's mocking me!" "Aw, go ahead and mock me!" "It's not my fault I didn't get into medical school!" "That was one of the requirements!" "And I had to get into some stupid pre-med program... where I paid a guy to tell me I was smart enough to be a doctor!" "And it was a total lie!" "But then my dad died, and I had to get this job... which is good, 'cause the baby needs all the free doctors it can get." "You know, you don't have to be all mean about it." "You want me to help?" "Oh, hey, we'll sit down." "He'll do anything for food." "Just promise to show him your naked belly button." "And a picture of your dad, because that's the only way to cheer him up." "Oh, how could he even know about my dad?" "I can keep a secret!" "You just tell me yours!" "I don't have a dad." "How could I have lost him already?" "Well, okay." "Your son's right." "We should do something special for his father." "Well, he could have some clothes or something." "He can't even walk!" "Well, I could take him into town tomorrow and get him some new ones." "Yeah, I'll go with you!" "Okay, it's a date." "But we're gonna need a wagon... so he doesn't have to get into anybody else's stupid poop." "I'll bet nobody else knows about the deal we have with St. Ann." "I'll bet there's a secret code on all my mail and stuff... that I'd have to go in and look at." "You know, once you get in the system, you can't get out of it." "You think that makes you nervous?" "I got three kids to feed." "You look at my hands." "See?" "Look at my hands." "I got my hands for our children." "I want them to have everything." "I don't want them to have to worry about this... while I'm dying of old age, leaving them with nothing." "Don't you worry about that, my love." "You and me... we'll have more babies." "We'll be here forever... like lizards." "I am very happy right now." "Do you want to come in?" "Okay, but I gotta pee first." "Okay." "I'm glad you're here." "Me, too." "That's why I wanted to come in." "Me, too." "Look, we're gonna fix this." "We're gonna keep fighting." "We can do this." "You know, I always thought that we would get married someday... and have a family." "And then..." "I got the twins." "And then..." "Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo!" "Oh, man." "I gotta do this by myself?" "Dryer?" "Got it." "Okay." "Yeah, you know what?" "Here we go." "Ready?" "You know, when I started over in this business," "I had like two agents." "And they both quit." "And now I have my own agency, and it's growing like crazy." "You know, we'll have our own team, and..." "And I'll make so much money I'll have to make you sign a prenup." "And then, you'll never see me again, and we'll both be very happy!" "You all set?" "Oh, yeah." "I've been in my position before, okay?" "And my legs can really get you right where you need it." "There's nothing in this world I won't do for you." "I know." "Can you please close the door?" "Oh, no!" "I'm a woman." "Men are supposed to come through the door." "Aah!" "Oh!" "We have to do something!" "This is insane!" "We're gonna starve!" "He's not gonna go without eating something." "Then we'll have to get something for him to eat, so he comes back!" "You know what?" "We need some bait." "No way." "No way!" "I'm not going into the kitchen with that thing!" "All right." "Fine, go get some bait." "Good luck." "You're gonna need it." "Go get some bait." "Oh, you're looking sharp today!" "Let's go!" "Let's get 'em!" "They went out there." "Go away, St. Ann." "You can't have my son!" "No!" "Yes!" "No!" "No!" "Yes!" "St. Ann's here!" "The baby's coming!" "We have to get St. Ann to go away!" "I'm not taking care of him all by myself!" "I got a job!" "I've been looking for a job for like a month!" "I was gonna go with you!" "We could go together now!" "What's gotten into you?" "If we could just get St. Ann to go away..." "I'm not letting that thing get my baby!" "You know what?" "It's time to get the big guns." "You know, like... a real hunter." "But you don't have a real gun." "Yes, I do!" "It's like a stick, only it's bigger and not wood." "Okay, you go get it!" "Bring it back!" "Where is the big gun?" "It's a secret." "It doesn't come out till the day before we go back in time." "Where is it?" "Gimme it!" "I'll go get it, but you have to help me, okay?" "Why can't you just do that?" "What does it look like I'm doing?" "I'm taking care of a newborn." "And look, you're the one who wanted him out here, not me!" "Oh, man!" "Okay." "We've got St. Ann gone for now." "It's a shame we can't spend our vacation here." "It's not so bad." "I bet this place had a pretty nice nursery... when it was in the shape of an island." "What do you think the baby's gonna be when it grows up?" "Maybe a doctor or a pilot?" "Come on, guys!" "We don't know nothing about him." "I don't know." "Maybe he's like a little robot." "Or maybe he's like, uh, maybe he's your twin or something." "What's that?" "You remember the thing that your dad sent you when you were in the womb?" "Yes!" "Yeah, but..." "I don't know what that has to do with this, but we don't have no twin." "Just remember." "We don't know what's gonna happen, so we better just get used to the idea." "Hey, can't you guys stay a little longer?" "Yeah, I wish we could." "But it's my day off, and, you know," "Amy and I have this whole beach thing that we gotta get ready for." "You know, sun." "Wanna talk about this more tonight?" "Yeah, I'm gonna call you on my way home."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:38
