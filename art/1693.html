If you wish to have your order shipped after that date, please note the delivery date on the confirmation email (before or on May 8, 2019) when you place the order.

We're sorry that some of these items are currently not available. The new 25th anniversary logo T-shirt, which we initially thought was going to be available in sizes other than women's small, had a very poor quality-control problem, and is no longer available in that size. There was no production run, and it was only produced to satisfy the public demand for this product! We are currently investigating alternative methods for acquiring them.

No, this is just a little bit of nostalgia for everyone who participates. You'll receive a copy of the commemorative pin featuring Hubble’s golden armadillo, two T-shirts (one for yourself and one to give away), and two copies of the book Hubble’s Cosmic Journey, which will come with a certificate of authenticity, signed by Dr. Matt Mountain, the author of the book.

Not really. You can order just one, or as many as you like! Orders may be placed any time during the party, and you will receive the order when we are able to ship it to you. Your shipping address must be in the U.S. We are not responsible for shipping delays.

No, as a special offer, we've made arrangements with STScI to give discounts on some of these items to all the people who place orders during the limited time period between now and the anniversary on May 25. We have provided a few options for customizing this offer: (1) you can use the promotional code STC25, (2) the code is already included in the item description. These choices cannot be combined with other discounts and offers. If your order includes both the STC25 and another special offer, you will only be charged for one of the codes. If you receive any of these items through this promotion, you will be entered into a drawing for a free year of STScI membership.

No, but we will send you an e-mail with more details.

You can request your order as many times as you want! We cannot guarantee that all requests will be honored, but we will do our best to fulfill them. Please allow up to two weeks to process your request. To request a T-shirt, please call 888-466-6342 or e-mail the orders@stsci.edu. To request a copy of Hubble’s Cosmic Journey, please send a physical mailing address to the same e-mail address.
