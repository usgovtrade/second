The latter two were only recently composed for the project and were not performed until this run. The songs all feature lead vocals and saxophone by David Fiuczynski.

"The Sound of Music" received its world premiere in May 2016 at the South Shore Music Circus in Hoffman Estates, Illinois.

Recordings
Music From A Valentine Theatre originally only consisted of tracks from "The Sound of Music" and "Play or Go Home". In late 2016, "Harmonize" was added to the setlist, and more recent incarnations of the show have included both "Play or Go Home" and "Harmonize".

Other tracks in the world premiere cast recording include:
 "It's a Hoot" – vocals by David Fiuczynski
 "It's a Free-for-All" – a children's singing game, recorded by the audience
 "The Game is the Thing" – vocals by David Fiuczynski
 "The Game is the Thing" – recording of a video that was projected onto the stage's screen while the scene was performed
 "How's It Going" – the only piece from Play or Go Home featured on the cast recording, sung by David Fiuczynski

The songs all feature lead vocals and saxophone by David Fiuczynski.
