sports-viewing parties. 
That's fine in theory, but the party is 
not that enjoyable with only the TV for 
company. 
But when you combine that with real-time 
updates on the Internet, you have the 
most exciting party in town. 
It's on the Web, you can take part from 
anywhere in the world, you'll only be 
tied to the TV by your satellite dish. 
And you can even watch sports for free. 
In an industry that doesn't usually reward 
the underdogs, we found the underdog, the 
underpaid. 
In our quest for a bar that not only offers 
the best sports bar atmosphere but the 
greatest value for sports fans, the bar we 
found is a neighborhood bar in one of the 
oldest working class neighbourhoods in 
Toronto, Roncesvalles. 
Roncesvalles is known for low rent. 
But it is also the site of one of the great 
barcades in the world, a kind of beer bar 
that's actually a cross between the beer 
bar and the pool hall. 
Roncesvalles is Toronto's own beer 
culture. 
With its large number of bars, it's 
something of a cross between Paris and New 
York City. 
But for sports fans, the real stars are the 
sports bars and this was our top choice. 
The bar may be called St. Clair's, but I 
promise there are no saints here. 
They sell all kinds of cheap beer and the 
owner does everything in his power to 
make sure his customers know it. 
I got the impression that everyone was 
cheering together. 
The St. Clair's beer bar is one of the 
best places to watch sports because all the 
action happens in front of you. 
You can place a bet for anything you like, 
but our recommendation is to play roulette. 
The sports fan who spends the night in 
the Roncesvalles St. Clair's should probably 
carry a bucket because it's likely they'll 
be able to empty it before the end of the 
night. 
What do you want to bet? 
Our top sports bar, the Sports Centre, 
is the oldest bar in the city. 
Its fame is such that even people in 
other countries recognize it. 
I don't think there's a world 
championship or World Cup 
that doesn't use it as a backdrop. 
Their motto, "The House That Sports Built", 
makes them the most famous sports bar in 
the world. 
So it's the top choice. 
And I think it's an absolutely magical 
place to watch a game. 
You can watch every one of these games. 
The sports centre was actually an old 
billiards hall. 
It was remodelled by a famous sports bar 
owner, Fred Sargent, and turned into what is 
probably the best sports bar in the world. 
Sports centre. 
The only problem is that as it stands it 
has the feel of a really fancy gentlemen's 
club. 
But you don't come here to see the people. 
You come here to watch the game. 
Every one of these rooms is equipped with 
a huge TV screen, including the toilets. 
How often does that happen? 
The reason it's such a great sports bar 
is that the ceiling is so high that a 
small TV can accommodate 100 people. 
So you never feel crowded here. 
At certain times, we can even make do 
with 100 chairs. 
Here, you get to know the other people in 
your section. 
It's not uncommon for beer to be consumed 
through a straw. 
It's also the place where the 
proprietors have made sure that you can 
watch the same game from every seat. 
It's so cool. 
To make room for beer, the patrons have 
been forced to move the pool table. 
The first floor of the Sports Centre is 
called the House of Sports. 
And it's where the main events take 
place. 
The biggest events take place right here, 
the Toronto sports awards, the CFL Grey 
Cup Awards, the CFL awards, the NBA games. 
That's where the main event happens. 
This place never disappoints, in all the 
years we've been going there. 
It's the best place to watch sports in 
Toronto. 
Everything has been arranged for you. 
You can watch the main event from there, 
from every seat. 
I can tell you that you can't do that at 
any other place. 
I've seen sports in Toronto. 
I've been to the bars. 
None of them compare to the Sports Centre. 
There is one other place that you may want 
to consider. 
The second place. 
As far as watching a game goes, this is 
the best one, this is the only one. 
I don't recommend it. 
The Sports Centre doesn't just let you 
watch a game, they'll bring it to you. 
They also have the most knowledgeable and 
friendly bartenders, and the most popular 
bar in the country. 
This is one of those rare sports bars that 
doesn't have a bar. 
The Sports Centre is the best place 
to watch the NBA, NHL or NFL. 
There are the best bars for watching any 
sport. 
If you're a hockey fan, look no further 
than the Sports Centre. 
You can watch every NHL game on any of 
their 65 TVs, or you can watch the Toronto 
Marlies, for the hockey fan who's too old to 
go out but can still play beer pong, it's a 
great place to watch hockey. 
The Sports Centre. 
As the oldest bar in Toronto, the sports 
centre is a natural choice for sports fans 
who don't mind the idea of watching in a 
smoky bar. 
But if you're looking for that special bar 
experience, you'll find it at The Mosaic 
Club, one of the best places in the world 
to watch sports, with the best atmosphere 
you'll find on the planet. 
The Sports Centre. 
The sports bar that has a million-dollar 
arena. 
This is where the Canadian Football League 
is played. 
It's a great place to watch sports. 
In fact, this is where many of the games 
take place. 
We just came from here. 
If you've always wanted to watch a hockey 
game and wondered where you could do it, 
this is the place for you. 
It's a great, sports bar. 
We're sitting in the right section, if you 
look closely you'll see it's a hockey game. 
The atmosphere here is very special. 
If you're a hockey fan, the place to be is 
at the Mosaic Club. 
And the perfect sports bar to watch the 
Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team is the 
Maple Leaf Gardens. 
This is our number-one pick. 
The Sports Centre, if you're looking for 
something special and don't mind missing 
out on the party, the Sports Centre is a 
great option for you. 
Sports are for men, the Mosaic Club is for 
men, and women and children. 
They serve beer, sandwiches, pastries and 
delicious snacks. 
Everything you want. 
The Mosaic Club. 
And of course, they have beer. 
If you're looking for a perfect sports bar 
to watch the Leafs and a hockey game. 
The beer is fantastic. 
And what does a hockey fan drink on the 
other 364 days of the year? 
Ladies, what does a hockey fan drink on 
the other 364 days of the year? 
We can help. 
In addition to being a great sports bar, 
it's also one of the best places to see a 
baseball game. 
And I think it might be even more romantic 
than the other one. 
It has one of the most stunning views of 
the city. 
So if you can afford it, go for the 
Toronto's newest landmark: the Skydome. 
It's actually the world's largest indoor 
gymnasium. 
It seats about 24,000 people. 
We'll take a closer look. 
We get the same sports bar action and the 
action is at the core of what makes the 
Skydome amazing. 
It's not just</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:06
