I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things.
The Doctor, and by now the Cybermat, is getting up to go and do other 
things. 
Kent: Come on, Sarah, come here. Come on, that's it. 
Sarah: What do I do? 
Kent: You're holding his hand. He'll want you to give him mouth to mouth. 
Do you see the slot? 
Sarah: No. I need my medical book. 
Kent: Good. Just do it. Good. I'm going to go to the control panel. I'll 
be right back. Be careful now. Don't pull him up. You'll pull him up and we 
won't be able to get him back. 
Sarah: A Cyberman's mouth is full of all kinds of nasty little things. You 
wouldn't want him to spit in your mouth, would you? 
The Doctor: He can't if you're pulling him up. You don't want to pull him 
up, 
Sarah. Just leave him. 
Kent: Okay, Sarah, okay. There's no problem. Don't worry. 

The Doctor: Sarah! 
Sarah: Yes, yes, yes! 
The Doctor: Oh, wonderful! Did you find it? 
Sarah: Just leave him. 
The Doctor: I've just got to get a screwdriver from my TARDIS. Sarah, what 
about the engines? 
Sarah: All that stuff is jammed up. Look, we don't have time for that now. 
The Doctor: But, Sarah, it's my ship. 
Sarah: Don't worry about the ship. You've got to get off this planet now, 
right away. Sarah! 
The Doctor: What? 
Sarah: What's happening? 
The Doctor: Where is he? 
Sarah: He was right here. He's gone. He's left. He's not coming back. 

The Doctor: Hello! 

The Doctor: (in the TARDIS, playing "Who Will Buy" on the keys) 
Doctor Who: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: [at the top of his voice] 
Doctor Who: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: [playing up] 
Doctor Who: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: [off again] 
Doctor Who: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: [playing fast] 
Doctor Who: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: [playing real fast now] 
Doctor Who: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: [playing faster and faster] 
Doctor Who: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: [playing the tune very fast] 
Doctor Who: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: [playing the tune very fast]

THE FATE OF THE UNFORTUNATE
[ The Doctor's theme music plays really loud.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[ The Doctor stops playing his theme music and the music that is left is the 
tune of "Unchained Melody," so of course we hear the sad song.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor stops and then starts playing his theme music again, then, he 
starts to play "Unchained Melody" and again, we hear the sad song. Then, the 
Doctor stops the tune and starts to play his theme music once more. The 
"Unchained Melody" part keeps playing and we hear the sad song, but it is 
louder.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor stops playing his theme music once more and now we just hear the 
sad song. We are not able to stop the sad song from playing, even though 
everything else is very quiet.] 

The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[Then, the Doctor stops playing his theme music again and the sad song is 
still playing and we hear the sad song getting louder and louder.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[Finally, the Doctor stops the sad song from playing.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[Then the Doctor starts playing his theme music.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[He starts to play "Unchained Melody," but the sad song does not sound 
louder and we hear "Unchained Melody." It is a weird experience, and you 
don't realize the sad song is not going on until the Doctor stops "Unchained 
Melody" and the sad song returns.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor stops playing his theme music and the sad song is once more 
playing very loudly.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor stops the sad song.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor starts playing his theme music. The sad song is louder.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor stops the sad song from playing again. And it's a weird sound 
because the sad song is louder than the "Who Will Buy" tune when it first 
came on the radio.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 

THE CRASH
[This is a repeat of the ending part of part 1, but in the TARDIS because of 
the bad stuff the Cyberman did.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Cyberman runs out of the room. The Doctor is by the time circuits in the 
TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor does a jump across, but he misses. The Cyberman runs to the 
TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor does another jump and he grabs the Cyberman.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor is spinning his head around in circles and looking at the 
Cyberman.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor jumps through a wall and the Cyberman is very surprised to 
discover where the Doctor is.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor goes through the wall and the Cyberman is still behind him.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor grabs the Cyberman.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Cyberman's eye is still pointing towards the TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor grabs the Cyberman's arm and the Cyberman is trying to hit the 
TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor runs and the Cyberman gets closer and closer to the TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor runs and stops by the TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor grabs the Cyberman.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Cyberman hits the TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Cyberman throws the TARDIS on its side. The Cyberman throws the 
TARDIS' 
other arm up.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Cyberman is now holding the TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor grabs the Cyberman by the leg and throws it up. The Cyberman is 
now hanging up and there is a crack. The Cyberman goes through the crack and 
the Doctor picks the Cyberman up again.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor picks the Cyberman up again. Now, the Doctor starts doing jump 
the Cyberman around and around and the Cyberman gets very upset. The 
Cyberman goes down. The Doctor goes up and gets the Cyberman.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor starts to do a dance while the Cyberman falls apart.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Cyberman is still falling apart.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Doctor goes through the wall. The Cyberman is falling apart.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Cyberman goes into the TARDIS.] 
The Doctor: Cybermen! 
[The Cyberman is now walking on the TARDIS. The Doctor</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:26
