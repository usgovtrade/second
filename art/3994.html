19:50 local - A brief steam-and-ash eruption occurred with a column height of 1-2 km.

August 17, 2011

19:31 local - Steam and ash eruptions from the volcano in the past few minutes have resulted in a low level of ash fall in the area surrounding Mt. Erebus. There were no reports of any significant ash fall on surrounding sea ice during this event.

August 17, 2011

23:00 local - Several small ash emissions have occurred from the volcano in the past several hours. These emissions are occurring every few minutes, with only low levels of ash fall observed on surrounding sea ice.

August 14, 2011

18:00 local - The Alert has been lowered, and all Alert Station personnel are now on standby. If significant volcanic activity is observed from the Alert station at any time during the night, Alert staff will sound the Alert. The Alert is likely to be raised again once the Alert Station observes signs of a new crater on the lava flow area.

August 13, 2011

20:00 local - An explosion took place at the cone vent on Mt. Erebus during the early afternoon today. Although it is not clear what initiated the explosion, the result is ash emission and intermittent small explosions. The Alert is still at level 4.

19:00 local - Today, lava activity at Mt. Erebus was noted at about 16:00, though not much activity has been observed by this time, other than some mild and mostly intermittent gas and steam emissions. As a result of increased activity observed during the past few days, the Alert is increased to level 1. The Alert will continue at level 1 for a week. All Alert personnel will return to duty tonight. If there is further significant activity over the next 24 hours, the Alert level may be increased by one level.

19:00 local - Today, the Alert level has been raised from 1 to 2. This means that minor eruptions of lava and ash have resumed from Mt. Erebus, but the Alert status does not yet reflect the most severe situations of the past few years, when lava and ash emission increased to a level of around 4 and a level 5 was reached. No significant activity is expected to occur in the coming 24 hours.

March 21, 2011

19:30 local - The Alert is at level 1, meaning lava emission has resumed from Mt. Erebus. The new activity has apparently been going on since about noon, but at a low level. The current alert level has been maintained at level 1 for several weeks now.
