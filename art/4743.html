Earlier this week, Google was showing off new features in Chrome 63 which allow users to protect their private data even after a browser takeover has been initiated. The move by Mozilla is particularly notable since it comes just months after the company unveiled the 'Tracking Protection' feature which was introduced in Firefox 58 and 60 and which was developed in collaboration with the European Union-funded Disconnect project.

Mozilla has explained that Chrome 63 relies on a set of heuristics to detect when users are being tricked into installing unwanted software. Firefox 57 doesn't include any such functionality and it seems unlikely that Mozilla will roll out any such anti-tracking features for users before Firefox 63 which is due for release in June of this year.

In Firefox 57, Mozilla disabled all of the options related to data-collecting add-ons by default. Furthermore, Firefox 58 added protections to try and prevent unwanted add-ons from accessing users' sensitive information on the device.

If you haven't done so already, you can read our guide on how to disable unwanted data collection on both Firefox and Chrome. You may also want to take a look at these add-ons.

Summary Article Name Firefox 57: No Tracking Protection (yet) Description Firefox 57 has a new experimental feature that allows users to monitor the permissions of add-ons but lacks the option to stop unwanted software from being downloaded. Author Martin Brinkmann
