He has performed with a number of artists, including Peter Sarstedt, Shirley Bassey, and Engelbert Humperdinck, whom he has dubbed "the world's most over-rated singer". The duo's vocal harmonies were often praised in the press, as were the arrangements they composed for many of the songs, though the lyrics were often criticised for being banal.

They have released two albums: 'The Greatest Songwriter Ever', and 'The Next Album' - most of which was recorded in a 'home studio' in his home.
