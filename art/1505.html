The woman I was seeing at the time was named Jessica. I met her because she wanted to be friends with my best friend. (I was also friends with her best friend.) Jessica came to my best friend's house for dinner one night. One thing led to another and we became very, very, _very_ close. I would later learn this would not have happened if Jessica had not been such a loyal, wonderful friend of my best friend's. I didn't see Jessica for years and then out of the blue we ran into each other again, and we both immediately realized we had feelings for each other. This happened in Los Angeles during Super Bowl weekend; it was around midnight and Jessica, my longtime best friend, was with a girlfriend. Jessica and I talked, got to know each other again, and had a few drinks together. It was after midnight when I left. Jessica went back to her girlfriend's hotel.

On Tuesday, I met with Jessica, and it was all falling into place. She and I were in love, but I was worried about Jessica's other guy, the one she lived with and was engaged to. I suggested we date but not live together, just see how it felt. This was a good idea for both of us, even though it was a little tricky. I worked out of town a lot during this time, so my girlfriend usually came with me and would stay at her mom's house. We would do it that way so I would not feel like we were living together. (The girlfriend and her mom knew about Jessica but did not have a clue about my new love.)

At the end of the summer, the girlfriend and I decided we did not want to be engaged. She did not want to get married for a long time, as she felt she did not have the same feelings for me that I did for her. I was devastated when she broke up with me, but I was really relieved that we could work things out.

The girlfriend and I were staying at my mom's house when my girlfriend's mom said I needed to come over and talk to Jessica. I told my girlfriend that I was not ready to talk yet. She said, "I love you, man, but I can't keep doing this." That was our only conversation about it.

I sat down in Jessica's room and she told me she loved me. I told her the same and that I loved her. It was like love at first sight. We kissed for about ten minutes and we both agreed that we could not get enough of each other. We went back to her room and got naked. She was extremely beautiful and all natural. (I was looking at her pictures on her desk. She was so hot.) We made love all night. We got up at six in the morning. She cooked me breakfast and we lay in bed talking.

I was on my way to work and said I was not looking forward to work. I said I would be happy to call in sick. She told me she had some business to take care of and that she would come to the office with me that day.

I was a little nervous but figured if she had made the choice to be with me it must be because she really loved me.

She stayed at my place, and I never had a worry in the world. We had some lunch meetings that day and then she went back to her place and got ready to come to work. We walked down the hall and she said, "We don't have to work out." I went back to work and later that night she called me to say she would be coming over later.

She said she wanted us to celebrate our new relationship. The more we got to know each other the more we liked each other and thought we were better for each other than anyone we had ever met. We decided to go to dinner and a movie. We saw Saving Private Ryan, a great war movie.

We got back to my place and were about to go in when we saw that the dog had gotten out. Jessica was not too happy about that. She would have had to take off her pants and shoes to get her underwear and socks off to look for the dog. I told her it was okay, and I went back inside to get my shoes on.

Then I heard something like a "tssssss," then what sounded like a woman scolding her dog. Jessica was walking around calling, "Here, here, here," while she was trying to find the dog. Finally she found it and brought it inside the house. After that she seemed more at ease.

We went in and had a great evening. We were having the time of our lives. We went to sleep that night. (I fell asleep before she did and she was awake looking at me.) She said she could not sleep with her back to me. We agreed to sleep in my bed.

In the morning we were both up and getting ready to leave for work. As we were getting dressed, I turned to her and asked, "Have you ever done anything kinky?" She said, "No, I've never done anything kinky."

Well, I knew she had never tried anything kinky before because she was a virgin. I asked if she wanted to and she said yes. We went back into my bathroom, sat down, and started kissing. I started kissing her neck and rubbed her breasts over her shirt, then unbuttoned her shirt and looked at her breasts.

She just looked at me and asked, "Are you still okay with this?"

I said I was definitely okay with this. So I removed her bra, then her shirt, and started kissing her breasts. They were very small and soft. We stood up and kissed and she said, "Let's get some new things together, then we can have sex." I said okay. She went to the bedroom and came back with a tube of K-Y jelly. I had never used it. She told me to put it on. We were kissing, then she started kissing me all over. We took off the rest of our clothes and got into bed.

She then asked me to do K-Y. I told her to turn over. She was ready for me. Then she said, "You have to keep going, baby." I asked her why and she said, "Because I want to get fucked." She was already on her back with her legs slightly up by her head. I started by kissing her toes, slowly made my way up to her legs. She kept moving them up by her head and that kept me very turned on.

As I worked my way up from her legs to her vagina, she said, "Yes, keep going." I put some K-Y jelly on the tip of my finger, and with my thumb I entered her.

She said, "Oooh!" She told me to go slow. I worked my finger in and out. When I had done all the K-Y, I started kissing her inner thighs and her vagina. She was very wet and my finger went in easily. I was inside of her at that point, but she asked me to put some more jelly on. I put some jelly on the head of my penis and entered her. It was really fun. I tried to go all the way in, but I could not. I felt it would be better if we could go slow, so I backed out and then tried again. This time I went a little further and got all the way in, feeling the most amazing feeling I had ever felt. The feeling was unbelievable. It was the most incredible experience of my life and that was probably one of the best things she could have said.

I stayed in her vagina for a while, then asked her, "Are you okay?" She said, "Yes, I am so happy." I told her I loved her and I felt incredible. She just looked at me and smiled and smiled and smiled. I asked her if she wanted to go to sleep. She said yes. I said I would stay in the bed and she could sleep in my arms.

About thirty minutes later, she said she would go to sleep for about an hour and then she would want to make love again. I went into my bedroom, put on a condom, and came into her from behind. It was very hard for me at that point because I wanted to lose it, and I did. She said, "You should have gone inside before you came." I told her it was no big deal, as I had before. She asked me, "Did you come a second time?" I told her I was still hard. She said, "How big is your cock?" I said, "Thirty-five to forty millimeters." She said, "Wow, I wish I could be that big!"

After she told me that, we both looked at each other, and our eyes were so swollen. We made love again and she fell asleep again. We slept for a while and talked, and she had a great idea: We should go to the hotel, where we first met, and see what happened. I asked her if she remembered. She said yes, she remembered exactly.

We went to my place and packed. I called a cab, put my stuff in my room, and got in the cab. It was only two blocks to her apartment and I really felt good.

We got to her apartment. She opened the door and we were standing there when the guy walked in. He looked right at us, gave a</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:03
