"You don't get it!" "I'm a human being, not a piece of meat!" "Not a fucking punching bag, or whatever the hell it is that you are!" "Oh, man." "Oh, man." "I got the chills." "I got the chills." "So... we're not doing this?" "What does that mean?" "Hey, kid." "Yes, sir." "Hey, man, you've been released into our custody." "As a prisoner, I get these for free." "Not anymore, you don't." "I'll give you $20 for it." "You know what?" "Here's $30." "Have fun." "Yeah, have fun, college boy." "This is the guy who bombed the MTA." "How's it feel to be sleeping on the couch for a while?" "Hey, your cell mate was released three days ago." "What are you talking about?" "Released where?" "What the fuck are you talking about?" "I'm talking about your motherfucking cell mate, Travis." "You know who that is?" "He just got out three days ago, huh?" "Don't worry about it." "You're the only one who matters in here." "I got to take a dump." "Listen." "Listen." "Listen." "No, you listen." "I want you to know something." "I want you to know I didn't rat you out, all right?" "What are you talking about?" "That prick Pritchard set me up, all right?" "I had nothing to do with that shit, man." "I didn't do that to you, Travis!" "Get the fuck away from me!" "Hey, hey!" "Hey!" "Relax." "Relax!" " Get off me!" " Get him up!" "No!" "No!" " Fuck off!" " Shut the fuck up." " Listen." "Listen, man, listen." " Get off!" " Listen." "I found something out." "About one of the guys who did do it." "It turns out he's going to the police, he's going to tell them who the real shooter was." " Who?" " Who?" "Who?" "Pritchard." "Okay?" "He's going to tell them it was you." "All you have to do is sit tight." "Huh?" "Huh?" "And in a year, if you behave, you can have a transfer to minimum security." "If you don't, then we'll just have to find another place for you to live." "Yeah?" "Whoo-hoo." "You ever get lonely in here?" "You know, I mean, I got so much time to think," "I got a lot of time to think about this stuff." "Hey." "You know what?" "I get lonely, too." "Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about." "I know." "I know." "Hey, you want to know what I really think?" "I think you got a secret stash somewhere in this cell, you know?" "Like, a lot of weed hidden away." "Am I right?" "Yeah." "I'm right, aren't I?" " Hey, hey, come on." " You know..." "You hear that?" "That's the sound of Travis having a good time." "Right." "Hey, man, look, look, you got lucky today, all right?" "That old guy was a cuckoo." "Are you fucking with me?" "There's no way he was a cuckoo." "You're better than that." "What are you looking for?" "Nothing in there." "It's cool." "Hey, listen." "If you want to hang out with me, man, you got to start being a bit nicer to me." "I'm not trying to be your friend." "You just met me." "I've known you a long time." "You're my cell mate, man." "That's all we are." "You got to realize that, if you want to survive in here." "Okay." "Okay." "I see what you're saying." "I'll try to be nice to you." "All right?" "Okay." "Shit." "Did you see that shit that happened to the guy in 4B?" "What?" "Who, Cates?" "He was in here three days ago." "He was fine." "Okay, here we go." "Did you have any problems changing the media?" "No." "You got the receipt there?" "Yes, I do." "No problems, huh?" "No problems." "Good." "There you go." "You're all set." "Have a good day." "Thank you for coming." "Okay." "What do you want to do?" "Do you want to go grab a beer?" "That's fun." "Yeah, it was fun." "Can't go back though." "Why not?" "Got to get my uniform cleaned tomorrow." "You got to get in a shower, too." "You smell bad." "I'll see you back here." "What the fuck was that?" "You can't talk like that, Travis." "What, you think just 'cause you're a cop you can say whatever you want?" "No, I mean, you can, but I could arrest you." "Okay." "What, are you a fucking kid?" " What's your problem?" " What's your problem?" "Seriously." "Why don't you shut the fuck up?" "Why don't you do your fucking job?" "You know, I'm just sitting here trying to relax." "You come and just bust my balls over..." "Fucking bullshit!" "I'm sorry." "Jesus Christ." "Hey!" "Hey!" "Stop!" "Stop!" "What the hell is wrong with you?" "I'm sorry!" "What are you doing?" "What the fuck is wrong with you?" "I didn't mean it!" "Shit." " What's the problem?" " Yeah, yeah, come on." "I didn't mean it." "I didn't mean..." "I..." "All right." "Okay." "Thank you." "Didn't mean it." "Didn't mean it." "Yeah, you didn't mean it?" "Shit." "Okay, we're cool." "It's all good." "You know, you can't run around beating people's brains in without asking questions, you know?" "That's bad." "Yeah." "You guys got to keep that in mind." "We're getting to know each other." "Don't worry about it." "All right." "See you later." "Yeah, all right." "What's your problem?" "What's your problem?" "Why can't you talk?" "I'm sorry." "I can't work like this." "What, are you a fucking baby?" "No, I'm not a fucking baby." "Oh, good." "You know what, man?" "Look, if you can't talk to me," " we're not friends anymore." " We're not friends?" "You were my best friend." "You were my only friend." "Yeah, well, if you can't talk to me, we should be dead best friends and buried friends, okay?" " What are you doing?" " What?" "What's that?" "What's what?" " What is that?" " I don't know." " What is it?" " That's a rock, I think." " A rock?" " A rock." " Is it a diamond?" " It's an adamant." "It cuts glass." "Why would someone throw a rock through a car window?" "Beats me." "Are you okay?" " Yeah." " Okay." "I'm sorry." "You got to be more careful with these things, okay?" "I just..." "The rocks just came out of nowhere." "It's like, out of nowhere, like, one just flew through the air and hit me right in the head." "Yeah, man." "Let's get you cleaned up." "Yeah." " I got blood all over me." " Careful." "Oh, man, you can't get blood all over you if you stay on your own." "You need someone to help you with that." "Yeah, well, how about him?" "He seems to want to help me a lot." "That's probably 'cause you helped him out." "Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too." "I'll be back." "Hey, man." "We're out of towels." "We're using them to bandage people's hands." " Tie them off with some string." " No, you're not." " I got some extra string in the car." " Okay, I'll go get it." "Go get it." "Go get it." "Hi." "What the hell are you doing?" "I was getting your string for your hands." "What..." "What, are you trying to be nice to me now?" "No." "No, I'm..." "I'm trying to help you." "That's what I'm doing." "I'm trying to help you." "Oh." "Is that what you call it?" "I don't know." "Is that your thing, being..." "Oh, that's real nice." "That's a real nice thing to do."
