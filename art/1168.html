Iâ€™m sorry for the interruption, but we have to come to an agreement: In the next episode of TAS1MP, someone will die. The choice of victim depends on your participation and decision. The voting will continue, but we will take your opinion into account. You can also say whatever you want in the comments below, and we will hear you.

It is also time to return to the new story in TAS1MP: The Legend of Babel. If you have not played the game and have not gotten it yet, then we are waiting for you in the beginning of this story. If you are in the second part, then go to the second level (2) to get all your progress back. If you are still in the first part, then stay on this level. Here you should wait for the coming of our new hero. What we promise you - we will return to it at the end of the fourth episode. Stay tuned with SqueenixGames and watch the next episode of Let's Play "The Legend of Babel" to find out about our new hero.

As always, we are looking forward to your comments, positive or negative. They will all be considered in this rating.

The rating of the last episode:

4,55/5.0

Spoiler:

The player has already died, we could not save you and we got your soul. The decision to finish your life came from two places - the player himself, who wants to try the second level (2) of the game, and the developer. The decision was not easy to make, but if the player made a mistake, we can not get his soul. We need to save the hero, so we decided to do this. The choice was not easy. Do you understand what is happening? Do you understand what happened in the last level (4)? Well, you have to understand what happened.

And here we go again. To get the second part of this level, you should play the game until the end. There is only one way to do it - find out who killed our heroes and finish the game. After that, it would be right to finish this story and get a new hero.

This is the last episode of Let's Play "The Legend of Babel." In a new story we have a new hero, who will protect the world. That is not a surprise, we have another character. The player was killed in the last episode (5) and we need to find out who is the killer. We promise you, after the second part of the level (2), we will return to TAS1MP again. Until then, you can watch the next episode.

We will wait for your comments, positive or negative. If you want to say something about this episode, please leave a comment or write a review. Also, we want to inform you that at the beginning of the new story we started, so the next episode will be the first episode of the new story. We decided to wait for some more reactions, that is, we need to wait for the reaction to the new game. For the moment, our story is taking care of itself. But, do not worry, we have a plan for a new video. It will happen in the next week or two. Stay tuned with SqueenixGames and wait for the new episode of Let's Play "The Legend of Babel." You should watch the TAS1MP game and learn all about it.

The last episode of the "Legend of Babel" is ready to be watched. The hero of the game was killed by the monster in the last episode (5) and it took revenge for that. As a result, we got his soul and we will give it to the developer. After that, we hope he will keep our hero and will give him a new life. Until then, we will wait for the next part of the story and will find out who is going to be our new hero.

We are waiting for your comments, positive or negative. Stay tuned with SqueenixGames and watch the last episode of Let's Play "The Legend of Babel" for the next episode.

In the last episode of the new story, we have a new hero, who we believe is our hero for the new part. That is our player and we are playing on his behalf. The choice of our hero did not come accidentally, we have a plan to continue the story. But do not worry, we are not ready to give up on our heroes. All the new story will be presented in the new part of the game. Also, we will return to the original gameplay of TAS1MP and to the first part of the new story, where we start in. The time has come. In the next video, we will continue the story of TAS1MP, where we will continue our work with new heroes. Stay tuned with SqueenixGames and enjoy the last episode of Let's Play "The Legend of Babel"!

The last part of the TAS1MP story was completed and we see a new hero, who we see in the opening credits of the game. This is our player and his avatar. We will play on his behalf and now we will enter a new part of the game. We decided to not rush the story. Also, this is the beginning of the original gameplay of TAS1MP. Only, there is no need for more heroes, but instead, we need more tools. In the last episode of Let's Play "The Legend of Babel" we talk about the new hero and the new tools. Stay tuned with SqueenixGames and watch the last episode of Let's Play "The Legend of Babel."

The developers have started a new story and, as a result, we have a new hero for this story. The choice of our player came from the developer, who believes in our project. Also, we played together with a friend and saved his soul from destruction in the last episode. We were ready to do anything to save the soul, because we care about our player. We hope this project will be completed and we will have a happy ending. We are expecting your comments, positive or negative. If you have comments or have some questions, you can write us in the comments or write a review. Until the next time, we wish you good luck and success in your future gaming!
