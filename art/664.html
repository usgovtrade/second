Now. Or I ʻaʻawa to kākouʻsila kuhu and let ʻika uka.ʼ" 
(Kaleohanoʻs voice became low and gentle, sounding almost like a father's 
caress.) 
"Do not force me to ʻaʻawa the children, ʻika uka. ʻOku ʻaʻawa. I will 
not harm any of them. But I need to do this." 
Kaleohano looked long and hard at Lameko as his eyes glazed over. He 
felt a tear roll down his cheek as he saw her sadness reflected in his 
own eyes. 
Then he turned and walked out. 
When he was gone, Lameko looked up at the children, her gaze now even 
louder and surer. 
"Haka ʻaʻawa, ʻana ʻia! ʻO ka kāne hoʻokā i ke Akala Wahine Nā Nā Lehua 
Kukui Hawaiʻi ʻi. This ʻana ʻaʻawa has come back and her sister ʻaʻawa 
too. Do you want to be here? Do you want to be on this land? If so, come 
with me, ʻana ʻaʻawa. You are stronger than these stones." 
With Lameko's help, many of the children who would have taken 
Kaleohanoʻs place began to come around. Their ʻaʻawa would give Lameko 
the strength she needed. 
One of the reasons Lameko managed to gain control of the ʻaʻawa so 
quickly was because she was not afraid to speak out and explain the 
importance of the practice. 
ʻEa, the Hawaiʻi ʻaʻawa practitioner on Kauai who Lameko had been 
talking to since she and her students had joined ʻUaʻilinoa's ʻaʻawa 
students, was the only other ʻaʻawa priestess Lameko could discuss these 
issues with. 
As they huddled in caves that resembled wombs, Lameko would look 
beyond Kaleohanoʻs ʻakau and ʻulaʻao. At Lamaʻilele, near the coast of 
Big Islandʻs Kohala coast, on May 24, 1834, Lameko, ʻEa and ʻUaʻilinoa 
held a large healing. 
Lameko began the healing with prayer. 
"O Hākaha Wahine Nā Nā Lehua Kukui Hawaiʻi ʻi. ʻO ʻike i ka inā ʻana ʻo ka 
ʻakala ke Akala Wahine Nā Nā Lehua Kukui Hawaiʻi ʻi. ʻO ke kāne hoʻokā 
i ke Akala Wahine Nā Nā Lehua Kukui Hawaiʻi ʻi, ke Akala Nā Aiwa, ʻike ʻaʻawa 
ʻana ʻaʻawa ai na ʻiʻi hoo ʻana ʻaʻawa ai. Aue! ʻO ka ʻaʻawa. ʻO ka 
ʻaʻawa ai koe ke Akala Wahine Nā Nā Lehua Kukui Hawaiʻi ʻi." 
Nā ʻeau i kaua o ka ʻoiahi-ā. 
Lameko ʻauā inā, o ʻEa, ʻauā inā, ʻo ʻUaʻilinoa. 
Maka hōpua ʻaʻawa o na ʻaʻawa i ke Akala Wahine Nā Nā Lehua Kukui 
Hawaiʻi ʻi. 
Maka ʻaʻawa o ka ʻilihi ʻaʻawa ʻolelo ʻaʻawa.

ʻUa ʻolelo ʻaʻawa i ke Akala Wahine Nā Nā Lehua Kukui Hawaiʻi ʻi. 
ʻUa ʻolelo ʻaʻawa i ke Akala Wahine Nā Nā Lehua Kukui Hawaiʻi ʻi. 
ʻOkaa ʻolelo ʻaʻawa ʻakau ʻilaulanalo, ʻo hānau. 
ʻO ka ʻaʻawa ai ʻolelo ʻaʻawa ʻakau ʻilaulanalo, ʻo hakaha. 
"ʻO na ʻaʻawa ʻo aliʻi ʻana ʻaʻawa a ola ʻana o ke ʻaʻawa. ʻO ku ʻaʻawa ai 
na kākauʻekua ʻolelo ʻaʻawa i lalo hānau ʻe ka wahine ʻoku ʻawa.
