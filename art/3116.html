"You Get What You Give" is a song written by Phil Coulter and first recorded by the Irish traditional music group Planxty. They released it on the album Rags and Robes in 1982. The re-recorded version, which is also the album's lead single, reached number one in the Irish Singles Chart, as well as spending four weeks at number one in the UK Singles Chart and also peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.

Background
The original Planxty version of the song was a traditional Irish song popular in Scotland at the time, which was adapted to express the sentiments of the Troubles of Northern Ireland. The song was credited to "The Kildare's" rather than to The Wolfe Tones, a group from County Kildare in Ireland.

Chart performance
On 10 November 1982, "You Get What You Give" first entered the Irish Singles Chart, at number one for four weeks. It was only beaten from number one by another song about the Troubles, Elton John's "Blood Brothers"/"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me", which also spent four weeks at the top in December 1982. 

The re-recorded version reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1983. In addition, "You Get What You Give" spent five weeks at the top of the Irish Singles Chart, as well as spending four weeks at number one in the UK Singles Chart. It is their highest-charting single in both Ireland and the UK to date. It also charted in many European countries including France (where it peaked at number four), Spain, where it hit number-one for six weeks and is one of their biggest hits, Germany, where it went to number three and Belgium where it hit number two.

A re-recorded version of the song was recorded by the Scottish folk band The Proclaimers and released as the band's debut single in 1988. This version reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart, number 23 in Ireland, and number 68 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also reached the top ten in Canada and New Zealand.
