Musical style 

50 Cent's music incorporates many elements of hip hop music, as well as elements of genres such as house music, R&B, and rap. In one review, music journalist Sowmya Krishnamurthy referred to the album as "an amalgamation of rap and pop." The album was described as having influences from house music and rave music. Its music has also been compared to The Neptunes. In a similar vein, Rolling Stone noted the album's "trap sound" similar to that of Atlanta trap music. Several tracks from the album were noted to have a reggae vibe. Music critics have described the album's musical style as "futuristic" and "disco-tinged".

Production 
While writing his previous albums, Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson had a clear vision of what he wanted his next album to sound like. In an interview with Noisey he explained his views on why the album's sonics are similar to one another:

Speaking with Noisey about "No Sour Notes" in 2018, Jackson recalled that the song is "the first true 50 Cent song that I've ever worked on." He continued, "No other artists I was working on this album with were really into the sound... The first time I worked with other producers besides Eminem for these songs and producers like Boi-1da and Hit-Boy, I would always say 'you guys didn't give me my vision.'"
