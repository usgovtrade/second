## PEPPERONI

3 pounds sweet Italian sausage

1 ½ pounds hamburger

1 large onion, thinly sliced

1 green bell pepper, cut into strips

1 red bell pepper, cut into strips

1 red bell pepper, cut in half

2 tablespoons garlic, minced

2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper

6 large potatoes, peeled and cut in ½-inch dice

2 to 3 tablespoons oil, as needed

4 large eggs

Salsa and grated cheese, for serving

Preheat oven to 450°F.

Spread Italian sausage on a baking sheet and roast, uncovered, for 10 to 12 minutes, until meat is browned. Slice sausage on a slight angle; set aside. Combine hamburger, onion, peppers, garlic, and pepper in a large bowl. Add black pepper to taste and toss to coat. Spread mixture on a second baking sheet. Roast, uncovered, for 30 to 35 minutes, stirring halfway through, until meat is browned. Let cool slightly.

In a large stockpot, cover half of potatoes with water and boil until tender. Drain. Add remaining potatoes to stockpot, cover with water, and boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain well. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add sausage mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until mixture is lightly browned.

Add eggs and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.

In a large bowl, combine half of the potatoes, half of the sausage mixture, and half of the potatoes and sausage mixture. Stir to mix. Add half of remaining potatoes, half of remaining sausage mixture, and half of remaining potatoes to potato mixture in bowl, stirring to mix well. Transfer potato mixture to a large baking dish or 9-inch cast-iron skillet. Repeat with remaining potato mixture, sausage mixture, and potatoes.

## BAKED APPLE FILLED DOUGHNUTS

_Doughnuts are a part of family tradition in our home. When it was time to buy doughnuts, my dad was always very careful to take a look at the ingredients before choosing a flavor._

_The first two doughnuts I remember eating were homemade, and they did not disappoint. This is a new twist on the basic doughnut. Instead of using a pastry blender to mix the doughnuts, we mix them by hand. Although these are a healthier version, they are so good, I'm not sure you'll mind._

**2 teaspoons active dry yeast**

**1 cup warm water**

**1 teaspoon salt**

**2 teaspoons granulated sugar**

**3 to 5 cups all-purpose flour**

**3 to 5 tablespoons oil**

**1 teaspoon baking powder**

**2 cups apple juice**

**Topping**

**2 tablespoons butter, melted**

**½ cup granulated sugar**

**¼ cup packed light brown sugar**

**1 egg**

**4 medium apples, peeled, cored, and sliced into wedges**

**8 packets (7 to 8 grams) sugar substitute, crushed**

**1 teaspoon cinnamon**

**Powdered sugar, for serving**

**Maple syrup, for serving**

**Cinnamon sugar, for serving**

**Butter, for serving**

In a large bowl, mix yeast, water, salt, and granulated sugar. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes to proof. Add 3 to 5 cups flour, oil, and baking powder to yeast mixture. Knead well to mix, adding a little more flour if dough is too sticky to handle. Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature, or until doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 375°F.

Pour apple juice into a large stockpot. In a small bowl, combine sugars and egg and beat with an electric mixer for 1 minute.

Place apples in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet and add half of the apple mixture. Mix to coat. Repeat with remaining apple mixture.

Remove dough from bowl and pat it down into a 15-inch circle. Cut into 16 triangles, starting with the triangle at the bottom of the doughnut shape and working up to the top. Place doughnuts in the apple mixture in skillet, cover, and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together crushed sugar substitute and cinnamon. Brush melted butter over the hot doughnuts and sprinkle evenly with cinnamon mixture.

Place on a wire rack and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar and maple syrup, if desired. Serve with butter and cinnamon sugar.
