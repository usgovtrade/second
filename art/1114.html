I arrived there March 1980. How time flies.
One of the reasons I took the job was it had a very good dental plan.
In fact, you could do anything except have root canal and crowns covered by
the insurance.  That made up for the low pay.
of course, would come under the heading of "other", would be reimbursed about

Well, as we all know, computer science is a new science (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science).
I'm a civil engineer.  I'm pretty computer savvy, but it was some serious
brain work on that thing!  I'll be getting another one any day now.
If it didn't hurt so much I'd be tickled to have one of my own...but that's
a long story best told over a drink or two.
In other words, if you're trying to figure out how to save a human life, then
you're an engineer, if you're trying to figure out how to make a car run, then
there's a lot of engineering involved...  In any case, you'll need a good doctor.
The last two decades have brought enormous improvements to the medical field and
it is now possible for people with serious illness to extend their lives considerably.
A simple aspirin a day has been shown to reduce heart attacks significantly.
The same holds true for some cancers.  The human life span is increasing.
When I first came to this country, and especially in New York City, the average
birth age was about 40.  Now it's around 60 and it is believed that it will go
higher, perhaps as high as 80 in the next decade or so.  It isn't just
people who live longer that we should be concerned with...we also need people who
can spend more years being productive citizens of our society.  The more brain cells
I think that technology has played an enormous role in improving human life
throughout history.  My grandmother's life was extended many times over as a result
of better medical care and technology.  The old adage that medicine is a branch of
history...we've come a long way and there's still a long way to go.
Let me answer my own question.  I did this all in the last six months and
to do so without losing my job.) Here's what I did:

I am an EE graduate and I agree that a computer system is only as good as the people
who design and maintain it.  It's a fact of life that there will be errors and as
long as someone is around to fix those, you can feel confident in using the
machine.  You just have to keep in mind that not all humans are equal, some are better
programmed than others, so you need to be able to sort out who is good and who isn't.
You're a doctor?  Did you go to MIT or Carnegie Mellon?  Where do you work?
By "engineer", I don't mean you're working on a computer system or anything.
I mean you're really in the engineering world.
> You don't happen to be a computer science graduate, do you?  Sounds like the kind of system
As far as I know, computer science is a new science (see
computer systems.  You're right on the mark with regard to programming, it's a trade,
just like plumbing or carpentry.  To put it another way:  "I'm going to have a
new bathroom put in, what do you charge?"  "Well, that depends on the size of the room".
If your goal is to become a doctor you have much more to learn. The medical world is
completely different from that of an engineer. For example, one thing I noticed when I
first came here was that medical schools seem very different from engineering schools.
engineering (not at the graduate level though), but even at the graduate level medicine has it's own special way of doing things.  I can't really go into it here, but just by reading the book
"How To Get Into Medical School" and talking to a few medical students will give you
an idea.  There are only about 4 or 5 people in the world with the knowledge needed
It is obvious from this exchange that we are still discussing a general topic and not a
specific event or specific individual.  Even though I don't have an MD, I have been in
your shoes more than once so please take the following information on faith because
it is based on my personal experience.

The more brain cells I keep in the game, the better off I'll be when I get old.

> I've always had a problem with people who talk a lot about "saving lives". If you talk about it as though it were simple then you make it sound like it is simple.  Many times people have very poor judgement in these situations which causes them problems and those problems don't get fixed and those people die and cause people like you more work.
It seems that you've been on the sidelines for too long.  I don't want to discourage anyone from going into medicine...I just want to point out that being a doctor is not an easy job and you should know that going in.  Not everyone makes a good doctor.  It's probably one of the most demanding professions there is...and they're underpaid!

>Well, as we all know, computer science is a new science
We'd love to have you.  You've been a teacher in the U.S. (undergraduate level?) and
I've done a bit of teaching myself in the past...I'll be retired in three years and
I'm sure I'd enjoy having a teaching job again.  Don't forget about North Carolina
Please don't go off topic!  Do you live near Atlanta?  That's where I'm located...

>to do so without losing my job.)  Here's what I did:
In short, use common sense.  You don't need a computerized system to tell you that a patient needs attention.  That's just the first step.
>4) As I'm almost positive we're in agreement on this, I will say this: A computerized system does not operate in a vacuum; there are humans involved somewhere along the line.  The programmers must be responsible for the quality of the program and must be willing to take criticism and suggestions from those people who use it, so that it might be improved.
>5) A person should never look at only one source of information.  I would recommend, to avoid mistakes such as the one I made, that the patient speak with their own physician before any decision is made about medical treatment.  The patient should understand all of the options.
