How’s that for an interesting way to get to know a person?

You don’t get much more interesting than this new release from director Andrew Bowler and AIC, “The Sinner.” When the cops arrest Rosie for murder, she has just one question, “Who will I become?” As we get to know the people of Gaffer’s Ridge, they all have secrets to tell and lies to hide. For the first time in a long time, Rosie’s not the one being chased.

I’m really looking forward to next week’s release of “The Sinner.” How about you?

It may be a little early to talk about the new release from AIC Films, “Gothika,” but why not? If it doesn’t make my list, then it’s not worth talking about. “Gothika” had something a little different going for it, and that’s one of the things I liked about it. And it’s got a good cast. It stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Naomi Watts as the star-crossed lovers. It’s not a thriller, but it’s fast-paced and good fun. They had me at “Sleepless in Seattle.”

It will take a lot more than a little girl to bring down Nick and Mia, but when their daughter disappears from the family home, Nick is on his own, trying to find out what happened. After a little girl named Alice disappears from her house next door, Mia becomes involved with a task force that is investigating the case. If the two detectives can find Alice, they may be able to find Nick’s missing daughter before it’s too late.

You can’t talk about “Gothika” without mentioning the excellent performances by the two stars. Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely riveting in this movie, and it’s just as good for Watts. She brings her characters to life in a more mature way than some of the roles she’s played in the past.

As in the past, I’ve already seen some of the films I’ll be watching this weekend, and there’s no place better to start than with a film by Michael Crichton. It may not seem like it when you’re watching the film, but “Disclosure” is a good thriller.

This movie is based on a book by Michael Crichton, and so far there have been five movies based on books by him. This one is one of my favorites of all his adaptations. It’s also one of the most difficult to find, not because it doesn’t exist, but because it’s been out of print for years. If you can find it, grab it, because it’s a good one.

This is the plot of the movie, from the film’s official site:

“‘Disclosure’ is the story of a woman who discovers a series of letters which her husband wrote to another woman and had intended to be published after his death. These letters contain the story of a two-year affair with an idealized woman he calls “Alice”. The discovery of her husband’s secret inspires a newfound passion in the woman he betrayed. Meanwhile, her son becomes more distant, and as she tries to save their marriage from unraveling, a dangerous chain of events begins to unfold.”

How’s that for a plot? It’s got an interesting hook, and although I’m not sure how realistic it is, the story has a lot of meat, and is one of the more entertaining thrillers you’re going to see all year.

The story comes to us from director/writer, Don Coscarelli (“John Dies at the End,” “The Beast”) and stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Robin Tunney, John Leguizamo, Richard T. Jones, and the always-incredible Milla Jovovich.

It’s the first of the month again. So, what should you be watching this week?

Well, “Star Trek,” the new “Sherlock Holmes” films, a lot of TV, the return of “Fear the Walking Dead,” and there’s something about a guy who is one of the richest men in the world and wants to be his daughter’s prince. But let’s start with the new release from AIC Films, “Gothika.”

This movie is one of the more unique films I’ve seen in a while. It’s not your typical horror film. It’s a love story, with Nick (James McAvoy) and Mia (Teresa Palmer), two investigators trying to find a missing little girl and a serial killer out for her. Even though he’s already a murderer, Nick falls for Mia while searching for his new target, Alice (Lily Cole), the little girl whose photo they find in the first few minutes of the film.

I liked the movie, and was pleasantly surprised by the actors. I saw this film because of James McAvoy, who, for some reason, doesn’t get as much attention in the press as some of the other actors, but he’s the best actor in this film, and he’s well-matched with an equally good-looking and talented star, Teresa Palmer. She was a little older in this movie than she is in “Teen Witch,” but I think she would have done a good job in that film.

The story wasn’t bad, and the characters were well-developed. This is the kind of film I like, because it’s got a little mystery, it’s got a lot of romance, and it’s got a lot of fun. In a world full of mindless shoot-em-ups, it’s good to see a film with an intelligent script that doesn’t just throw in a new action movie for the sake of giving viewers something new. It’s a smart film, and you have to give credit to the writer of this film, Luca Guadagnino, for working with the director, and also working with the screenplay. I’m hoping they do something for another film, and maybe make this one better than it was.

It was great getting to see her in “Fantastic Beasts,” but as far as she’s concerned, it’s the very last film she’s ever seen. It’s a dream sequence, and it plays a vital role in her life, but it’s not all there is to her story. It turns out there are many other realities, including a reality where Mia’s sister is an assassin sent to kill her.

One of the reasons I like it is because of her performance, which is so good that you’d think they were giving her real scenes to act in. This is a very tough role for someone to play, but she’s great, and I think she deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. Maybe she can get it for playing a werewolf in “The Wolfman.”

The only thing I didn’t like was a scene at the very end of the movie. It was a little too dark for me. There were a couple of other scenes with lots of darkness, but they went away pretty quickly. If this is what the director thinks is too scary, I’d love to know what he thinks is safe to show the audience.

When you’re a little girl in 1958, you’re told it’s a normal thing for girls your age to run around in short skirts and make-up, and even go to the movies to see the latest horror movie with blood dripping from the fangs of a monster that wants to kill and eat you. But when you’re 12 and a half, you realize the only thing scarier than the film was the idea that a werewolf killed your grandfather.

You’re 16, living in a very rural environment, and you work in a local bar that is frequented by a lot of the locals. One day a man comes in to ask you about where he can get a job. He turns out to be your long-lost uncle, who you find out was part of an experiment at the local college. Now, it seems that he has escaped, and if you don’t stop him, he will kill a lot of people in the small town, and you’re a witness to what happened, as you are also involved in the experiments. But it’s not as simple as running to the police and giving them his name. That’s a dangerous thing to do.

Yes, there are some other scenes with violence, but if you’re going to see this movie, you might as well know what’s in store. I thought it was a good movie, and I’d recommend it to anyone who likes scary movies.

It’s almost Christmas. So what should you be watching this week?

As usual, there are a lot of new movies coming out, including “The Dark Tower,” which I’m seeing for the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:00
