Many current communication systems use one or more multiple antenna elements and one or more receiver processing chains for every user within the system. In multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems, every user's signals are separated and processed separately, but in a synchronized manner such that a receiver and transmitter pair for a particular user never processes signals from more than one user. A MISO system for a large scale, multiple-user MIMO system with hundreds to thousands of users would require a very large number of receiver chains and transmission chains. Hence, there are a limited number of potential applications that use MISO because of the system complexity.
However, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with hundreds to thousands of users does not suffer from the same complexity constraints. In a MIMO system, receiver chains and transmission chains are correlated, as a receiver/transmitter chain cannot receive signals from more than one user. Hence, there is no direct correspondence between the number of users in a MISO system and the number of users in a MIMO system. As an example, a base station (BS) with three antennas and one receiver chain can easily serve more than three users in parallel. A MIMO system with more than three antennas per user, where each user has a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, can also serve multiple users in parallel.
A MIMO system is much more efficient for transmitting information than a MISO system because multiple independent streams of data can be transmitted over multiple transmit antennas simultaneously. Moreover, MIMO system is able to determine the transmission characteristics that optimize transmission of a signal to each user in a specific environment.
MIMO systems can use many different techniques to separate different users and provide them with optimal transmission. In addition, MIMO techniques can be combined with advanced coding and modulation schemes to further optimize the signal separation and transmission characteristics of the system. In particular, transmit antenna array location and geometry are factors that affect the determination of optimal transmit antenna weights and the optimization of transmission characteristics in MIMO systems. However, in large scale MIMO systems having several hundred to thousands of users, it may be challenging to determine the optimal antenna configuration. It may also be challenging to optimize the transmission characteristics for all users in the MIMO system.
Various types of devices can be used in a MIMO system. Some devices can be considered mobile stations (MSs) for MISO systems, and others can be considered MSs for MIMO systems. MSs include user devices or mobile stations (e.g., cellular phones, laptops, and tablets), and fixed or static devices such as wireless access points and controllers.
In view of the above, there is a need for systems and methods that can adaptively determine optimal transmit antenna weights, and that can optimize transmission characteristics in large-scale MIMO systems having more than about 200 to about 1000 users.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:50
