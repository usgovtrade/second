So, the real question is, are the recent rumors about my leaving the school overblown, or is this just one more case of the administration having to spin?

The answer, of course, is to keep an eye on the school’s Web site.

“The news of this move has come as a surprise,” wrote SJFCU President/Chief Executive Officer Mary Jo Wertz.

“I could not be more proud of the students, faculty and staff at South Jersey that have made this a great place to attend and work and I would be remiss not to acknowledge those that will follow in our footsteps who will carry the mantle.”

What a lovely sentiment. Let me just say thank you and goodbye.

Onward.
