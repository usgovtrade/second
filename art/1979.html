I prepared the tomato puree and mashed it with the back of a fork before pouring it into a blender. I then worked the blended puree through a sieve to get rid of any remaining bits of seeds. I used canned diced tomatoes rather than diced fresh ones, which are not recommended for recipes in which you'll simmer the puree for a couple of hours.
