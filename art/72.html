"If you want to win you must understand the enemy you are facing and the kind of training required. We, above all, want to win and the Americans above all. It is one thing to know what you are going to do, it is quite another to know how to do it and how to do it quickly, and how to do it effectively. We have all three. When all three are present, you have an unbeatable combination. (Jones and Brown 1956, p. xvi) 

In other words, Jones did not want to win at any cost, which is also where he came from and that's what I remember.  

To answer your question, Dr. Jones had a clear idea of what he wanted to do. His knowledge of the Americans was pretty clear. But he wanted to learn from them as well. 
He wanted to learn their culture, what their training was, how they lived their lives, the kind of training he required, and how to get that.  

He could have just asked the US Air Force and they could have replied with, "hey, we're gonna train you and you'll learn it all and when the war is over you will bomb the hell out of Germany." But he wanted to learn.  

In this case, he may have gotten what he wanted (because it may have been what he wanted to learn the most), but it is worth noting that he was quite unaccustomed to the idea. He had not been to the US and it was a pretty weird concept. 
I mean, I can understand what he meant, because US culture and military culture are completely different from the British. I was part of it for a few months. It was the most wonderful time of my life.  

As to Dr. Mengele, it is not that he had a specific purpose in mind when he was torturing the prisoners, but the fact is he did have something in mind, something Dr. Jones wanted to get away with and Dr. Mengele was probably the perfect man to help him.  

It is not that he wanted to murder the prisoners, it is that he wanted to murder them. He had the best motivation in the world to do it and to have the best methods of doing it.  

One thing to consider is that it is possible Dr. Mengele wanted to do this. He might have had something in mind all along and when he was in charge of the camp, the SS were trying to escape, which is how he was freed, and was not in charge, he didn't want to help them, because they were evil, and he was free to do as he pleased.  

This is in no way a general theory of evil, but this is a theory.  

It might not be true, because if that was the case, it is hard to see why he had so much money and was doing so much to get to England. The fact that he was very rich for the time and did many things to escape detection, says otherwise. He was a very rich man and he had resources.  

If the story is that he just wanted to torture and murder the prisoners, that he didn't know if he would get the opportunity to do it, it is likely he wanted to do that and it was his motivation.  

If he knew he had the opportunity, that is when he would get the idea, so the fact that he wanted to is because he had an idea, it's possible that his idea was not to murder, but that he had an idea that he would get the opportunity to murder.  

So, as to the question, it is not the right word to use, but it is possible, so the question is based on a false premise, but is not entirely false.  

Again, it is not a general theory, but it is based on the real history. It is not entirely wrong, but it is not entirely right.  

Finally, my question is not about Dr. Jones, it is about the Nazi science, about Hitler's experiments and about the victims of the Nazis.

Again, I do not want to jump to conclusions, because that is not the purpose of the question. I want to know what this person thought, how this person thought, how it affected the war, and if it affected the war at all.  

Now, I do not have a general answer, I do not know what he thought. I do not know if it affected the war or not. But I want to know if he thought it would affect the war, and I want to know what he thought about the prisoners of war, and I want to know if he thought it was right or wrong.  

I do not know how he thought, I do not know if it affected the war or not, I do not know if he thought it was right or wrong. I just want to know what he thought, and that is it.

Note that this is a question about a single, uneducated person, and it is not a general theory of anything.  

A:

There's no evidence of what Jones thought or what Mengele thought. There's evidence of how Mengele behaved and what Jones thought of Mengele.
I won't go into detail, but what is certain is that Mengele, despite his advanced age, was trained in the art of conducting gruesome medical experiments on living human beings.

There's a fine quote in a book by the surgeon Dr. Hans MÃ¼hlfeld, that I like. He said:

The most difficult work for the surgeon, apart from his art, was the
  ability to distinguish between right and wrong. To the man of honor,
  everything was right that would help to remove life from the human
  body, even if one of the things employed, was the devil, the devil
  that he knew was within. This is why the Nazi surgeon was not
  interested in anything else but was not concerned about the truth or
  the welfare of the prisoners but only about his own advancement.

Obviously, the Nazi system needed doctors, therefore there was a lot of demand for Nazi doctors and Mengele was the biggest name out there.
Also, he was a brilliant doctor, but he was only interested in developing means to carry out his work.
Also, he was well read, he was able to read original medical and medical-philosophical works and to that he added the experiences he himself had to the scientific-philosophical corpus.
He had a lot of knowledge, and he used it in a very efficient way to carry out his work.

Mengele was a monster, but he was also very knowledgeable and he used his knowledge in a very efficient way.

He probably developed himself scientifically by applying the things he had to carry out his work, by applying and understanding the theories and medical knowledge and by carrying out the things he had to carry out his work.
Jones, on the other hand, became a general and a military-political expert and was a very powerful individual.
His mind was on a completely different level to that of Mengele.

Jones was a general, but his mind was on a completely different level to that of Mengele.

I think this is what you were after, so you got an answer.

Jones could only observe what Mengele was doing and what results it was getting and what results it was not getting.
  Jones was not a murderer.

In addition, it is hard to believe that Jones would have had the balls to stand up to the "Big-A" general.
He was too powerful and too proud.
The only person who had the balls to challenge the "Big-A" general was Mengele and this is what Jones' mind was on.

Jones was an expert at killing.

That is true. Jones was an expert at killing, but he was an expert at killing the "other" in a very efficient way.

He was an expert at killing, but he was an expert at killing the "other" in a very efficient way.

He was very professional. He carried out his work in an efficient way, and he achieved the goals he was looking for.
His actions were very efficient. He was an expert at killing and he was an expert at killing in a very efficient way.

He was an expert at killing, but he was an expert at killing the "other" in a very efficient way.

He was a very cold man, he was a very organized man, and he was an expert at carrying out his work.
