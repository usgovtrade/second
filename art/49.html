Phillip,

I was not being disrespectful.  We were having a discussion about Enron and
we both agree that there needs to be more women in high level jobs.  And I
mentioned that my work with the National Association of Women Business
Owners is not as high profile as yours.  I don't know of your position, but
there is a big movement to place women in high level jobs and it would be
great for the whole country to start seeing it.  So for you to tell me that
I am just looking for another man (although a successful one) to date is
disrespectful and not worth the time and effort.  If you are not interested
in continuing the friendship then that is fine with me, just tell me what I
can do to keep the respect of you.  It's you that is getting disrespectful
(as far as I know, it's the first I have heard of the "man" part of our
discussion).  I don't have to keep going over and over the same points if I
am not interested in hearing you, so please tell me if you are and I will
leave it at that.

I am truly interested in seeing women move into these high level jobs, but
I also know there are some great men out there to balance the mix.  You
should have as many women on the "high level" as you have men, both as
individuals and groups, just as you should have equal numbers of men and
women in all jobs.

Thanks again for your concern about my dating life.

Anne

Phillip.

I know you said in your message that you wanted to talk with you about
things.
I'm not trying to pressure you to meet me for dinner. I wanted to ask you
a
few
questions about the relationship between men and women and it's role in
purchasing.  I know you are busy but maybe you could give me a short
quick
email.  Let me know if there's any way I can answer any of your questions
about
this issue for you.

You don't have to tell me about your life if you don't want to.  I'm
comfortable
with the fact that you can have other things going on in your life.

Thanks for giving this a thought.
