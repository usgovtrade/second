You will want me to do as I have said before, to surrender the children to the authorities in exchange for an improvement in my situation. It's quite obvious that the alternative would be death for them. But I could agree to that as well. It would suit your purpose and would mean that I would probably have some protection at least, given the fact that you are a law-abiding citizen. As things stand, I am on my own, and they could do with me what they want.

"But now, my dear Mrs. Brandt, it is my duty to warn you that if I go to the authorities they will surely keep the children and put me into some place where I won't be comfortable and can't protect them as I have done. I believe in them. I have seen what I haven't seen in years. If they come, if I am put into a home, I will die. I couldn't bear to see you go through what I have gone through. I might not have another chance to help you.

"Therefore, I must make the decision for you. I will leave it up to you whether you want to come back with me to the children or whether you have a better idea. I can let you in on a secret." He gave a slight grin. "I have two sets of papers with me, so that you can live a life where you are not dependent on them. One set of papers says I am your illegitimate son, which is not far from the truth. But the other set, which the authorities do not have, would make you a daughter and yourself a Jewessâ€”or whatever they are calling people who are not what they are. It may give you more clout." He gave her a penetrating look. "Do you think they would allow you to adopt children, for instance?"

She nodded. "It is why I came here," she said, "so that when the time came I could adopt a child to call my own. I had thought that I would choose one child from an orphanage, but . . . you do not know how a Jewish orphanage is run."

"But _you_ could be the one who chooses," he told her. "With that, I think you could get whatever you want."

She looked down at her clasped hands. "You have gone to a lot of trouble," she said. "But what you have done is far too dangerous. And I cannot understand why the authorities have not done something about you already. It would have been simpler if you had only left the country without their knowing. Or died. I would like to die too. But how can I take you to them when they are certain to think I am trying to save my own skin, that I am working with you? How can I take you to them and claim you as my own if we are working for each other?"

"They will let you go back without me."

"No, I think they would think that we had something to do with your escape. They will want to bring me in for questioning."

"No, no," he said. "You don't understand. If they keep me and find out I am your friend, there is no telling what they would do to you. Do you understand what I mean?"

She looked a little alarmed. "What do you mean? They wouldn't kill me if they found out we were working together to save the children."

"It wouldn't matter to them, believe me. If they couldn't have the children, they would kill you to keep them. I have seen it. That's why I want to get the children out of danger as fast as I can. If I am known as your friend and they know you helped me to escape, you can forget it. But you must be quiet. We must speak in whispers."

She looked dubious. "But they would come and find you. You don't have to hide from me."

"No, they are not sure about you, and they don't know about me at all. But even if they come, as long as we are together they will think I am just a neighbor who has come to visit. They won't know you from the child I see in the park. You don't need to hide me, for all I can do is die in my sleep. But you must hide. Don't leave your door unlocked, and for God's sake don't talk to me about this ever again. If you should die, and be found in this house, they will know everything. You will never be sure whether they will find you innocent or guilty. Believe me, no one will ever know."

"And what will you do?"

"Go back to that corner of the park and dig in the ground and wait."

"It will kill you. And if they catch you, you will be imprisoned anyway. I cannot do this."

"It is a chance I must take. You don't have to worry about me. I have lived my life as I have."

He was silent a minute or two. "You could be arrested as well. And I cannot see how the children would be any safer. They would just have a different protector. I don't think you understand what I'm saying."

"Oh, stop!" she cried out, raising her hand to her mouth. "I know what you are saying! But I can't just go along with the system. You're the one who came to me. I knew something had happened to the children. I had to do what I thought was right. You're just asking me to do the same thing. It's just because you know they want to get the children, and I am with them that you want to save them for me. You're right, it is my weakness, and I can't let you exploit it. How do you think I will live with that? I don't know what the authorities would do to me for taking your child. For my own safety, I must just have a little more time. Just a little more. If I have to give them the child, then I will give them the child." She shook her head. "Do you really think I am going to live in fear for the rest of my life? That I would hide from you until it was all done?" She put her head in her hands. "And what would it do to me if it went wrong? What do you think I would be able to face about this?"

He had been watching her closely as she spoke. "What do you think I would face?" he said. "I am no different than you, only I am willing to risk my life for you. You should be glad that I am willing to take this responsibility, to take your place."

"I could never say that. You do not understand my situation. You do not even understand what I want. And what if they think you've been helping me, helping the children, just to save your own skin?"

He was unperturbed. "I don't see how they would think that."

"I wouldn't be able to face you."

"All right," he said, standing up. "I am leaving. I have nowhere to go. I can't get back to my country, and I don't think they are still looking for me. Maybe I can find someone who will help you find the children. When I do, I will contact you."

"When will you be able to come back?"

"There is nothing we can do here," he said. "I may stay out of prison and into exile. Maybe, if I behave, they will even let me come back and live in Germany. I might have a chance then."

She did not believe him, but he had no more time to talk. There was no reason why she should ever see him again.

It was late that night when he went back to the apartment to take the children. The night clerk did not see him.

He went through the office at the desk where the night clerk sat. He had thought of getting papers under a different name. But he could not take the risk.

They were playing when he came in, the girl's blond hair shining. The boy was still looking at the window.

"You want to go back out to the park again?"

They both nodded.

"Then we must hurry. We will have to make sure the street is empty."

They said they were ready.

The last light was just going out as he took them back to their place in the park, carrying the large, leatherbound book. He told them to wait quietly. He would find the man. Then they were out of the park, into the street, and walking along as casually as he could manage. He had to walk on the sidewalk, holding the book and keeping the bag and the boy's hand close to his side. He had to move slowly, hoping that no one he knew would be out.

The street was empty. They went to the park, and he took them through. The park man was not there. But all the children were asleep, except one pair of eyes, and they were closed.

He showed the girl how to open the book and write in it. She was afraid. She wanted to do it herself. But he made her hold it still while he showed her how.

It was too late, for the man was already coming up the street.
