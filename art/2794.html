Kanye West was interviewed on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show on Apple Music, and the interview just dropped!
"I did six songs in one night, I just sang all of them and I did a bunch of interviews," he said when asked about how long he'd been working. "My favorite records, the best records were all done in one night. I did a whole album in like three days. I just made some beats, you know, the old school way and then, like, I made a song out of a beat that somebody else made."
Kanye also discussed his experience of a near-death experience while on stage with Kanye West and Rihanna at Wembley Stadium, discussing the details.
Kanye's interview with Zane Lowe was taped around one month ago. During the interview he discusses his reaction to the 2016 election, working with Pusha-T, working with Drake, and more!

Beyonce's recent single "Formation" set Twitter on fire with its provocative lyrics, the video's dancing and overall aesthetic.
Some argued that the video, which includes Beyonce and her backup dancers doing the Harlem Shake in a parking lot, was a form of blackface because she was imitating black dancers from popular culture and that the song itself was a parody of the black experience in America.
The video also caused some to comment on her skin, with users saying that Beyonce's skin was lighter than most of the dancers.
Twitter user @Hail_Jaz posted, "To the person that said black people could care less about colorism because we are literally BLACK. Lol."
Beyonce has never denied that the "Formation" video is meant to be a parody of black culture and she has also made it clear that she considers herself to be a "black American."
The artist's manager has also come forward in the past to dispel the notion that the single was meant to be a parody, though she said it was meant to "open a conversation."

On October 11, 2016, Kanye West posted an image of himself on his website, Kanyeuniverse.com, in which he was wearing brown contacts. The next day, the "All Day" producer said that the glasses were a result of him going blind in one eye for a week following a vitreous hemorrhage in that eye. "I got into this new style of contacts where it's a gradient from green to dark, I think it's called the Masc-Emmers," he explained in an Instagram video, and added that he tried to get them approved for him to wear at the Grammys, but didn't "have the strength to beg." "I'm like so blind. I'm just so blind. It's so crazy. I can barely see," he said.
This wasn't the first time he'd gone blind or worn strange glasses. In 2005, he was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, which causes facial paralysis, when doctors said it was "definitely not from drinkin' too much Hennessy," as West famously told the radio station Hot 97.
West had already tried to get past the disability when he wore "my little sunglasses" at the Grammy Awards, and explained that he's "never had issues with my eyes, but I got to my mom's house and I put some cool glasses on and one of the contacts had fallen out." He even went as far as having a specialist check his eyes before he left for Japan to meet the Koi Company, who "fixed" him, and he used the same glasses on stage at the Grammys.
On Twitter, he revealed that the glasses are fake contacts he likes and had made himself. "I tried to put some contacts in but you can see I am an amateur," he wrote. "Fake eyes."
His account seemed to mock the idea that his sunglasses were intended to be a signal of his distaste for the Grammy Awards — his original tweet about going blind after taking off the sunglasses was captioned, "I'm blind, bitch." — and he said as much himself. "They're not contacts, that's not what I was trying to do," he told GQ. "It's like me going, 'I know this thing has been crazy and everyone is losing their shit,' and I just wanted to show that I'm as blind as I wanna be," he said. "I’m just blind, it's real. It's my true self. The glasses are just more of a fashion."
However, it would seem that West can't leave his sunglasses in the bag forever. In May, he confirmed that his eye is "still very cloudy and blurry," meaning that he hasn't worn the glasses in public. "They're for on-stage and stuff like that," he told TMZ, before adding that he still doesn't want to wear contacts. "I've gotten to the point where I know when I put contacts in, they're gonna crack my eyes. And I don't like wearing contacts."
The glasses might be back on for the 2018 Grammy Awards. While at home in Wyoming, where he was working on his album "ye," Kanye explained that "They wanted to bleach my blonde for the Grammys, and I told them I ain't doing that," he said. "I’m going to rock these gold rims all the way to the Grammys. That's my statement. That's my answer. Why do you think I'm f---in' with this?"

In a new interview with Rolling Stone, Kanye West talked about his new video for "Fade" and explained how the song is a "breakup song."
"The title Fade is telling a story, 'fade in, fade out.' It's almost like a breakup song. Not so much I'm breaking up, but if I were to go to the club and see my girlfriend with someone else, that's the feeling I'd have. The beat, 'Fade,' sounds very James Bond-y," Kanye said.
"I know people want the next The College Dropout or Late Registration, but for me, my process is more like how it used to be. I feel like I'm going back to the way I created music before I had a record deal."
He added, "Before they told me what to do. When I had the freedom. I don't think I can do anything better than anything I've ever done. So the most important thing to me is how can I improve my past work."
West has said that his upcoming album will feature more "rhythmic" production than the more "bubbly" sounds of his most recent releases.
"It's actually kind of more rhythmic, but still soulful. I haven't necessarily worked with that many producers, but it's still gonna be more than one," he explained. "It's very soulful. I don't know what it sounds like yet. I haven't mastered anything. I mean, it's my fourth album."
Kanye recently took to Twitter to unveil a mysterious album cover of a blank white tile with the word "God" written in large gold letters.

Kanye West recently gave an impromptu performance of "Black Skinhead" at a concert in Paris.
The singer performed a surprise set for a crowd of about 2,000 people at the D?rieux Point in the city on Saturday, Oct. 22. He ran through about 10 tracks from his The Life Of Pablo and said that "most of the album will be out in December."

The show ended with West performing "Wolves" and the new track "Famous," which features verses by Ty Dolla $ign. You can watch the performance above.

Gwen Stefani gave an emotional speech at the Time 100 Gala on Saturday night where she gave a powerful tribute to her late husband, musician Gavin Rossdale.
Stefani, 53, opened up about her past relationship and how she still misses him, reports People. The singer revealed that the couple met when she was touring on a solo tour in London and he had just broken up with his girlfriend.
"When I met Gavin, he was singing songs at the piano and I fell in love with him the moment I saw him. That moment was like a connection," she said.
She added that she and Gavin bonded over his musical beginnings. "Gavin would tell me, 'Gwen, you know I really wanted to be a rock star when I was a kid, but I</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:40
