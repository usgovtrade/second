1 portion of Jellyfish 'N Chips

The jellyfish will have a nice light flavour, the chips crispier and crunchier, and just the right amount of seasoning and chilli. It's quite light and simple to eat, and you may not notice the jellyfish, but what a great food, so clever, and all on the one plate.

**Tuna 'N Chips**

**This is a tuna and breaded potato salad with some tinned crisps (tortilla chips) tossed in, if you want to call it that. It's been on the menu for quite a while now, and we've done a lot of tasters, but everyone still loves it. The flavours work really well together, the tuna provides the creamy taste, the crisps with the salt and the ketchup, and that touch of acidity from the ketchup.

Taste Test #46

**Chicken 'N Chips**

**This dish has quite a bit of depth to it, especially if you choose your chips carefully. We've used frozen chips to create a crunchy coating, which is great, but the real star here is the chicken. They used to do a 'boneless skinless chicken breast' version, and that was just ok, but for us it didn't have enough depth, so we added the crispy chicken skin, which worked really well. The 'N' word fits perfectly here.**

**Taste Test #47**

**Spicy Crab 'N Chips**

**I've done loads of tests for this one. All to do with texture and taste, and different chilli, ketchup and salad oil concentrations. One version had a massive amount of chillies, but all the trials and tests didn't seem to make much difference.

The result is this. We make these in two sizes. One is a smaller more finger-friendly size. These are usually the ones that go for Â£3, they are smaller than a tiddler's portion, and are a real treat. For the larger portions, we use larger chips. The texture is the same, but the oil and chilli concentration is much higher. It doesn't really matter which you pick, as long as you like spicy.**

**Chicken Nuggets**

**We've had the test for these for quite a few years now. It's one of the more classic ideas in a burger and nugget shop, and it's a bit of a surprise that there are quite a few versions. The one we've used for this one is the top one in our range, but the second from the top would work just as well.**

**Prawns Nuggets**

**The classic prawn and breadcrumb burger. These have been doing the rounds since they were introduced to the store, but we did make a few tweaks to get the flavours right. I thought that it would work well with prawns. Tasty little cubes of seafood, but I didn't think we could get the chilli, breadcrumbs, sweetcorn and lemon combination just right. We need to find a way to combine them, to make sure it all works, but in the meantime I think I will stick with this combination.**

**Taste Test #49**

**Tuna Nuggets**

**There's a lot of love for the tuna nugget and some for the chicken version. This works best if you get a good quality tuna, so that's what we're looking for in these next ones. We also try to make sure we can create the best tuna flavour. You should be able to see what we're doing with our flavours here. There's nothing more exciting than a tuna and sweetcorn combo.**

**Taste Test #50**

**Spicy Crab Nuggets**

**Another recipe for spicy prawns, but using crab instead. The crab makes the flavour super creamy, but the texture is very different, so you need to make sure you get a good crab. These nuggets won't win any prizes for being tasty, but they work well for those spicy kids.**

**Prawn Skewers**

**I think we've had these nuggets before, but it's a great finger food, and these give you the choice to eat them if you want. They are easy to cook and quick to eat, and can be added to any salad.**

**Taste Test #52**

**Chilli Con Carne**

**This works very well in a bun with a couple of chips, with the extra ingredients adding the depth and balance that was missing. We needed the chilli in the bun, the crispy tortilla chips and the cheese for the balance, and you can see this is a real treat. To me it's just a very simple but really tasty burger.**

**Taste Test #53**

**Chicken Satay**

**Another easy take on a street food classic. The chicken marinade can do a lot of damage, so a good tip is to put it on the inside of the buns, as this will get soaked up by the bread. It's a bit of an investment for what seems like a little piece of chicken, but I think it's worth it. The chicken flavour is fantastic, so for me it's a great example of a chicken burger.**

**Pizza**

**Most of these flavours were done last year, but we kept a few back and added the pizza one to the new selection. It's quick, easy to make, and a lot better for you than the standard takeaway.**

**Taste Test #55**

**Cheese**

**This one is one of my favourites. It's been one of the more successful, but we wanted to make sure that it was really good. The saltiness and depth are perfect, so the combination of the crispy bacon, the cheese, the sweetcorn and the sourness works so well. It has a good contrast of textures as well, so it's quite fun to eat.**
