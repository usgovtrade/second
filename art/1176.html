Nurse Red Dead Redemption 2 Ripoff. What is that guy doing? Oh no, why didn't you call me for help?

It's funny how the only problem everyone has with video games is how they make you act as a character. Not how the actual video game mechanics work, not that some of them are poorly balanced and they make you run for 10 minutes only to see your character fall down a pit in the ground, or that sometimes you run out of ammo but have to kill all the enemies for it because there is no resupply, or that sometimes there is some bug that makes your character start to move way faster than the frame rate would suggest possible, or that sometimes you get a health bar for taking damage for no obvious reason, or that there's an option that makes you invincible and is unlocked right away just because the developers felt like it, or that when you're killed in a game because you're trying to do something outside the gameplay boundaries, it's never your fault and it's always the games fault, that's weird, right?

What if I told you that games, instead of making you do all those things, could do the exact opposite and make you a perfect human being with a good moral compass? What if I told you that when you do certain actions in a game and do so outside of a normal context of the game, the consequences don't apply to the actions as they are meant to be taken? That as a result you'll be given a moral decision about what you want to do, with no logical consequences whatsoever? That some of the decisions you make would apply to the way real life works and some of them would not, because why not?

But, that would be boring! Not for me! That would be boring for me, I can't even begin to describe the joy in doing such things and seeing how my character reacts to them in the world around him, but just for the fun of it, no other reason, the rest of you can be boring.

I don't like all my achievements being wiped out just because I'm playing a bit outside the normal path of the game.

But I hate seeing my experience in the game being interrupted with these bullshit mechanics and this stupid dialogues and it's bad because:

It really interrupts the immersion (if you know what I mean) in a game that should be immersive.

It's not fun to see this kind of stupid dialogues, or really, dialogues at all (it feels more like reading some text in a tutorial), and I can tell it's really annoying to play for someone that wants to have a good time and have fun with the games mechanics without this crap everywhere in the game.

If you want to see some real immersion in a game, play a game like Metal Gear Solid. That shit has an awesome amount of immersion in a game. It's not even meant to be a game, it's a simulation, an experience, and if you do not like that, just play whatever the fuck you want. I'm not here to tell you how to spend your time. Don't like it? F off and play something you like instead of telling me what you should be playing. I just know that sometimes I don't want to be bothered with this stuff, especially when I want to have fun, not when I want to write an article on how amazing it is to talk to someone in the street, just a suggestion.

It's actually really entertaining if you can spot what's the problem and how the mechanics work. It's the exact same thing with all these open world games, people can't deal with it and complain about it. If you get to the point where you understand the game, then you can't even see the point in complaining about it anymore. In a way, it makes the game better, makes it more immersive. Because when you know what is going on you can concentrate on more interesting things. You're playing a game, not watching a movie or reading a book, you can deal with weird stuff being weird because that's a requirement to play a game.

Sometimes you just need to understand what's wrong to play a game. Not everyone is an open world kind of person. You might find some problems with it, not everyone will like it or get your jokes, not everyone gets everything the same way, or at all.

Yes, yes, you're right, I am the opposite of you and this game made me enjoy it way more than I thought it would. It really is a joy to walk through the wild or kill some enemies that were bothering me to go one way to get out of a city.

But... But... It's also not a game! Not everything has to be!

And as the games are becoming more and more like open world games, like The Witcher 3 and stuff, there are more and more developers that give you the tools to play</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:33
