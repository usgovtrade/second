Description:

This video is the first in a series of videos covering the Great Financial Crisis and the Great Recession. The Great Financial Crisis was essentially a massive loss of confidence in the world financial system after the events of 2007 and 2008. The effects were felt everywhere. There was a massive decline in commercial and personal lending and the prices of financial assets like stocks, bonds and property plummeted. But while the crisis was all around the world it actually started in the United States. This video will talk about the background of the Great Financial Crisis and where it came from. It will also discuss the various policy measures put in place in an attempt to turn the situation around and how the global financial crisis evolved. This is the first in a series of videos. We will try to get through a lot of ground in a short period of time.

Webinar: Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009

A Webinar that explains the financial crisis and how it is connected to the collapse of the housing bubble

History of the Great Global Financial Crisis by Prof. M. Ayhan Kose

What is behind the Great Financial Crisis? A history of Central Bank policy, Wall Street speculation and fraudulent accounting practices of the biggest banks. The video explains that the so-called market, is just an organized criminal activity built on fraud, lies, and deceit. The "free market" is actually an enormous crime scene on which the biggest banks are fighting for control over assets worth trillions of dollars. With so much wealth at stake, any attempt to regulate this financial crime scene would not be tolerated. No wonder the big banks and corporate lobbies are against financial regulation! What happened to the global financial crisis? Who was really responsible? And most importantly, what should we do about it?

A History of the Great Global Financial Crisis: Part 1

This video looks at the economic and financial causes of the great global financial crisis. We show why housing was so overvalued and how bubbles burst (we explain what a bubble is, why they matter, and show why the housing bubble was the worst). We also look at how the credit bubble eventually triggered a global financial crisis and show why and how governments reacted to the crisis.
(Parts 2, 3, 4)
