In 2010, she teamed up with American singer JoJo to form the band The Joy Formidable and released a string of EPs before releasing their debut album The Big Roar in March 2012. In 2015 she began a weekly column for The A.V. Club on gender issues.

Early life

Grimshaw was born in Southampton in 1978. Her father was an English teacher and her mother was a nurse. She has two sisters and one brother. Her grandmother's house was near an orchard, so she spent her childhood playing there with friends, and spent her time after school outside, pretending that she was on stage performing songs to the group of friends. When she was ten years old, Grimshaw was taken to see a local folk singer performing and was moved by the song. Her grandmother bought her a nylon string guitar, which she learned to play in two weeks.

She started to take an interest in rock music at the age of 14 when she heard the band The Replacements, which made her "furious" because her parents would not let her see the band. However, she was soon inspired by grunge bands like Nirvana and the Pixies.

Grimshaw took up painting in her early teens, inspired by the work of Mark Rothko. She was also inspired by the rock and roll album covers of the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Her first painting was a painting of her school music teacher, which she gave him in a Christmas card when she was 16. She then took a painting course at the Southampton Institute of Art. While there, she began designing T-shirts and selling them on the side of the street and in the music shop downstairs. She also took part in a college exhibition of artworks in a local gallery, where she met her friend Martin, who would become her first boyfriend. Her relationship with Martin ended when she started dating the drummer of the rock band The Replacements, Bobby Harlow. Grimshaw was inspired by Harlow, and by the way that he changed his appearance, in order to appear more punk rock. She began to describe herself as the "girlfriend of Bobby Harlow" rather than the painter she had been until then.

Career

Grimshaw performed her first gig at the age of 16 and performed with bands and music labels such as Jellycat Records and the punk rock group The Kills. She met her future husband, Paul, in 2002 through her boyfriend's sister and they began dating in 2003. They got married in 2006 and began living together shortly after.

In 2010 she formed the band The Joy Formidable with singer Josephine Olausson. They released their debut album The Big Roar on 16 August 2012, through their own label and on Jagjaguwar. Their second album, titled, What's the Problem?, was released on 22 June 2015. In 2017, she was included in the NMEs list of "25 Great Moments in Punk Rock's Last 50 Years".

In 2016, she formed a band with musicians and sisters Anya and Vera. They toured in the UK, Europe, South America and Australia.

Writing career
In 2015, Grimshaw launched a weekly column in The A.V. Club on gender issues. In 2018, she joined the editorial team at The Outline. Her writing can be found in The New Yorker, Slate, Marie Claire, Vice, Bustle, and The Guardian. She was hired by HuffPost to write a column on gender based fashion. In 2017, she began writing a monthly column for the online magazine of Elle.
