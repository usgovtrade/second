Time to Shine is the second studio album from American folk rock musician Jenny Lewis. The album was released on June 29, 2009 through Warner Bros. Records. The album's first single, "Gun", was released on March 23, 2009.  The second single, "Shirley Jean", was released on June 30, 2009.  A third single from the album, "I Want a Dog", was released on February 15, 2010.

On March 16, 2010, the album was re-released as Jenny Lewis, with the additional track "One Too Many Mornings", taken from the live performance of the same name. In September 2014, the same performance was released in its entirety as a 7-disc box set called Acoustic Classics, through Concord Records. It includes the original album in its entirety plus a bonus disc of unreleased tracks.

Background
Lewis began working on Time to Shine in Los Angeles, California, where she lived while recording The Voyager. Lewis enlisted help from several co-writers, including Benmont Tench, who had previously collaborated with Lewis on her debut album, Rabbit Fur Coat, as well as producers Ryan Adams, Scott Litt, and Don Was. Musicians contributing to the album include Tench, Adams, Mark Ronson, Al Clay, and Jay Bellerose. The album's release date was originally set for April 22, 2009, but this release date was delayed until June 29, 2009. The album was also released in the UK through Rough Trade Records.

Composition
Lewis told The Boston Globe, "All my favorite records are so different and distinct, which I think is one of the most exciting things about making music—in the past few years I feel like I've gotten to do a lot more experimentation and exploration in the studio. I find myself making a lot of these songs while I'm driving around. So much of it is spontaneous—I don't sit down with a sketch pad and a pencil and start penning stuff down. It's really intuitive. So when you're making a record it's not quite as methodical as you might think, but it was very important to me to try and write songs that felt true to where I am in my life right now."

Lewis told Spin magazine, "I felt like I was growing up and becoming a singer, so I made [the record] as an adult person. I'm kind of at a threshold point where I'm going through an identity crisis, which can be really fun or super frustrating. But I was really lucky because it was the first time I really got to work on a record in a studio without any of my own insecurities or self-doubt getting in the way."

Release and promotion
In January 2010, Lewis performed "I Want a Dog" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, along with Adams on the accordion and St. Vincent playing trumpet. This was the first performance of "I Want a Dog" featuring Lewis on lead vocals since her days in Rilo Kiley. Adams accompanied Lewis at Late Night with Jimmy Fallon as part of his Guest DJ slot on May 4, 2012. On May 15, 2010, a music video was released for the single "Gun", directed by Jeff Cutter. "Shirley Jean" was released as the third single from Time to Shine on June 30, 2009.

The first official single from Time to Shine was "Rabbit Fur Coat", which was released on May 19, 2008. "Rabbit Fur Coat" charted at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. The song's music video also features footage of Lewis recording Time to Shine, with a snippet of one of its unreleased songs, "The Dolphin", which did not appear on the album. In addition, "All of Me" was made available for streaming on Lewis' official MySpace page.

Critical reception

The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 66, based on 16 reviews. Q magazine gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, "It is not a record for every day but it does make a compelling case for herself." Uncut awarded the album 4 out of 5 stars and said, "She seems to have moved into a more contemplative phase on this album, with the singer and songwriter drawing on all manner of influences from Nico to Nirvana. Her songs can be dark or light, but they never sound complacent."

Time to Shine debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart, selling 20,000 copies in its first week.
