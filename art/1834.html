Wedding Jewelry FAQs:

Do we have to be dressed all in white for a wedding?

A special bridal set might be ideal to wear at your wedding, especially if you plan to do a theme wedding. If you have selected a white dress, then it is very important that the bridal set you chose matches your dress.

When choosing the perfect wedding jewelry for your bridal set you should always consult with a professional jeweler. Your outfit will have to be taken into account in order to create the perfect piece of jewelry for your special day. And, because everyone is different, an experienced professional jeweler is in charge of creating a piece of jewelry to meet your needs and wishes.

I had to move locations during the wedding, what if the bridal set I brought is not suitable for the next location and someone had to pick it up. How do I get it back?

The bridal set you were sent will stay with you even if you need to move to another location during the wedding. When you are making your choices for your bridal set we recommend you pick a piece of jewelry that fits your style and make up so that it matches every location at the wedding.

I want to order a bridal set, but I am not sure how to go about selecting the perfect piece. Is it ok to ask the store for help in finding a piece of jewelry?

We definitely recommend getting as much information as possible from the jewelry store. There are no right or wrong choices when you are buying a piece of jewelry and your personal taste and style must be considered in order to make your decision. Ask the store about the style of your wedding dress and, once you have decided on a bridal set, the best way is to take your time and get all the information you need so that you make the right decision.

At Valentino Bridal Jewelry we are happy to help you find a bridal set that is perfect for you, you can read more about this here.

As you can see, you have many choices when it comes to selecting a bridal set. If you are not sure about your choice, call us to discuss the best wedding jewelry option for you and your style.

Wedding Jewelry Collection:

There are two main types of wedding jewelry: the bridal set and the bridal party jewelry.

Wedding bridal sets are jewelry designed specifically for your wedding, in some cases, for a particular event such as your engagement party or your bridal shower. Bridal sets are not necessarily the same jewelry, although they are designed to match your wedding dress, they can be worn together or separately. They are not a pair of accessories and therefore, they are not “wedding accessories”.

Wedding bridal sets are very popular because they allow you to select a piece that best suits you and your style. This is something that is not as easy as it seems when shopping for jewelry, since sometimes the jewelry you see can be overwhelming or not the right size or style for you. This happens because your taste and style are not something you can decide on when you go shopping, you have to think about it in advance, which is why the right way to find the perfect piece is through experience and a good expert.

Wedding bridal sets are a great idea, but we also think they are overwhelming. This is because once you pick the right piece, you have to look at every detail of it, take all the measurements, think about how it will be worn and where, and how many different ways it can be used. It is a lot of fun but also very overwhelming and at some point, there is a tendency to call it quits, to say, “Forget it, I’m not getting it!” That is why we recommend that you do not go to the jewelry store right away but rather get all your information and let it sit for a couple of days so that you are not overwhelmed. If you do want to buy a wedding set, do not hesitate to visit one of our stores to get more information and pictures of our bridal jewelry collections.
