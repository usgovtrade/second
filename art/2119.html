  1. **Rule #1: You are always in control of your emotions, but be sure that they are rational emotions, not irrational ones.
  2. **Rule #2: Even if someone calls you irresponsible, make sure you're acting rationally and not reacting irrationally.**

It's true that you should always take responsibility for your own actions, but you should also never give someone the power to control you.

  3. **Rule #3: If someone makes you feel less than, try to remind yourself that you don't have to react to that person. Don't ever let someone tear you down; you only have to let them raise you up.**
  4. **Rule #4: Don't ever let anyone treat you like you aren't important.**
  5. **Rule #5: If anyone hurts you, be tough enough to walk away and know when to ask for help when you need it.**
