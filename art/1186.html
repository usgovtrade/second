Welcome! I'm from Arusha, Tanzania and work as a medical doctor in Sweden. I'm a global citizen - enjoying what this world has to offer, and always planning my next journey to taste the flavours of the world. I believe that global travel is important - both for you and for me. So let's talk about how you can become a digital nomad too! I'm currently writing from a beach in South East Asia, so that's my reality, and I'm very happy to share this with you. If you also want to share your reality, let me know - maybe we can learn from each other. And if you want to see more from my world, take a look into my Instagram feed - I'm @dragan_simic. Enjoy!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:34
