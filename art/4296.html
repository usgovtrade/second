The three-page summary, the public portion of the much-awaited FBI and Department of Justice report on the cyberhack, lays out the facts in regard to what they say happened: Russian intelligence agencies attempted to breach the DNC's servers in order to obtain confidential information on the Clinton campaign, using a fictitious persona—Guccifer 2.0—in order to disguise their identity. Russian intelligence entities then shared the stolen data with WikiLeaks.

Though the document does not actually include any proof of this information, it concludes that a Russian intelligence agency took part in a broad, covert operation that included the hack and later release of files on the DNC network in late July 2016, with the assistance of WikiLeaks. The cyber-espionage effort was part of a Russian operation that included cyber-operations against the U.S. government, the State Department and the presidential campaigns, among others.

"As a result of the compromise by Russian intelligence services, the private information of more than 8,000 individuals at the DNC were maintained on systems that were vulnerable to theft," the report says.

In addition, the release says that data from the 2016 presidential election shows a consistent targeting of the computer systems of Hillary Clinton's campaign, though no definitive link to Russia has been established. The Russians breached the Democratic National Committee, along with political action committees and Democratic Party officials.

Russia is thought to have targeted U.S. power grid and water systems, and hacked into systems that control American infrastructure.

The federal government says it will not identify those responsible for the hacks.

"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations," it says. "USIC assesses that the Russian Government’s goals were to undermine the US-led liberal international order that groups the United States and its democratic allies; to sow discord among US political parties; and to undermine faith in the US democratic process. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump."

In September, U.S. intelligence agencies said it was "confident" that the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, was behind the hack of the DNC emails, a claim the Kremlin has denied.

Though the report does not say who perpetrated the "spearphishing" attacks on the DNC's servers, they were linked to a computer system associated with GRU officers.

It is illegal to knowingly obtain or possess stolen or confidential information from a federal government computer, so it appears that Mueller's team was unable to establish a link to a human accomplice, the report said. But it said a number of people were still investigated for their possible involvement, including officers from the GRU, the Russian Federal Security Service and the Russian military.

The report is also devoid of the kind of in-depth analysis usually associated with FBI reports. It does not contain conclusions drawn by Mueller's team, or even a timeline of events. Instead, it simply says that his team "interviewed" a total of 26 witnesses and "reviewed" thousands of documents, though it does not say what investigators discovered in the process.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:50
