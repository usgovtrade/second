the market's own momentum.   Some of the factors contributing to this outcome 
are: 

?? The Commission's approval of the refund issue.  Once the utility did not 
admit any impropriety in its filings, it was almost impossible for them to 
contest the refund order -- and the refunds are due to start flowing soon.

?? The lack of any new significant generation capacity additions in California 
for 2000.

?? The ongoing need of generators and marketers to cover short term 
contracts.  Transmission constraints in California coupled with low CA load 
growth made for a shortage of physical delivery capacity into the state.  
Thus, the supply-demand imbalance at the Cal-ISO led to scarcity pricing 
practices and high spot market prices in 2000.

?? The relatively high utilization of generator capacity across California.  
This situation arose as a result of the need for coverage of short term 
physical and financial obligations.  When there are significant capacity 
needs, it may be appropriate for generators to cover these obligations by 
proceeding through the spot market.  Once again, this is a flawed market 
mechanism as a generator is forced to pay spot market prices for what should 
be cost based capacity payments.

??? Despite well intended efforts by the CAISO to mitigate the price risk in 
the market, spot prices continued to be volatile and increased dramatically 
in summer 2000.  This situation resulted from the lack of available 
capacity that was priced in the CAISO day-ahead and hour-ahead markets.  
Additionally, the continued low load growth in California created an overall 
weakness in the state.   The combination of lower load growth and the 
oversold situation in the state contributed to the market becoming increasingly 
unstable. 

?? The relatively high price of natural gas compared to the California 
surrounding markets.  Gas prices in California were 2.5 times those of the 
average US spot market and up to ten times the price in the Arizona 
surrounding market.

?? A new electricity market paradigm that is emerging across the United 
States.  We are now at a time when regulators are recognizing the 
importance of market dynamics in both the wholesale and retail markets.  This 
is evidenced by the fact that all states now have unbundled retail rates.

? 

This paradigm shift is making the electric industry "flat."  A generation 
provider with its own load served by an unregulated retail market will 
eventually earn more than a generation company with its own load served by 
California's ISO or New York's ERCOT.  The bottom line is that there are no 
long term markets for capacity.  There are only short term markets, and short 
term markets are the result of competition in the generation space.  

The CAISO and ERCOT are trying to implement rules that make the short term 
markets more attractive.  While we agree that these new rules are necessary, 
we strongly disagree with the CAISO/ERCOT methods for implementing these 
rules.  The CAISO/ERCOT is attempting to implement these rules as a series of 
day-ahead and hour-ahead markets.  

As explained in the October 20th NERC memo, the inability of the CAISO and 
ERCOT to determine the real time market price of energy to the CAISO/ERCOT 
has led to problems with their ability to design day-ahead and hour-ahead 
markets.  This problem arises because:

? In the CAISO/ERCOT markets, transmission constraints and associated real 
time prices are not available to the market makers, traders, and other market 
participants.
? In the forward markets, bids into the CAISO/ERCOT market are not known with 
any meaningful level of accuracy.
? Market participants have no other reference point other than the real time 
price to set offers in either the day-ahead or hour-ahead CAISO/ERCOT market.

This is an untenable situation that is being exacerbated by:

?? The fact that there are no long term markets with which to hedge this type 
of energy exposure.  Without long term contracts and the ability to hedge 
near-to-real-time exposures in the market, generators and market participants 
are left with little or no hedging tools.  The ability to engage in near-to- 
real-time forward contracts to hedge these exposures was critical to the 
effective working of the market.
?? Unsophisticated, but highly mobile and competitive, marketers who cannot 
be limited to only dealing with utility schedules.  This lack of utility 
sorting has created problems in scheduling in the market with no ability to 
sort the schedules by either utility or market participant.  This creates 
uncertainties about one's ability to actually schedule into these markets.
?? The CAISO/ERCOT, with no long term commitments to balance supply and 
demand.  This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the CAISO/ERCOT 
currently have no supply in storage and very limited operating generation.

It is clear that the markets are currently broken.  California is suffering 
from a shortage of generation capacity.  The CAISO/ERCOT have put a Band-Aid 
solution on this problem by creating these day-ahead and hour-ahead markets 
but the problem persists.  In addition, these markets are very illiquid, and 
therefore lack the necessary liquidity necessary to be successful.  It is 
illiquid because of the lack of utility and other supplier offers in these 
markets, the large amounts of uncertainty associated with real time prices, 
and the high natural gas prices. 

In order to implement a more market based approach to the problems in 
California, we need to allow supply and demand to be revealed in the near- to 
real-time wholesale markets.  This will provide participants with more 
transparency and confidence.  In addition, the CAISO/ERCOT should have long 
term transmission rights on all their circuits as a requirement to sell to 
the CAISO/ERCOT.

As an initial step to implementation of this approach, NERC is proposing 
this new paradigm for the northeast.  It is comprised of the following 
elements:

? One day-ahead market covering the PJM Interconnection, MAIN, and NE-ISO. 
? One real-time market covering PJM Interconnection and NE-ISO. 
? A second real-time market covering the NY Zone B market.

It is this new paradigm that we need to pursue on a national basis to address 
the problems in California, New York, and other regions across the country 
that are currently facing similar circumstances.  

As to who will pay for this new approach, a number of parties may end up 
paying for this paradigm change.  These are the three primary parties:

? The generators and marketers that benefit the most by a de-regulated 
environment and would ultimately bear the costs of this market restructuring 
through higher priced generation and more volatile prices.
? The CAISO/ERCOT consumers that ultimately bear the costs of this restructuring 
through volatile prices in the day-ahead and real-time markets.
? The utilities that ultimately bear the costs of transmission congestion and 
increased operating costs.

As you can see from the above discussion, it is quite a complicated issue.  
In order to better understand the implications of this solution, please feel 
free to contact me for our formal presentation to NERC.
