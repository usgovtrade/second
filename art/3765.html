the ballad that tells of a boy who goes out into the wilderness with
his rifle. “The only man there seems to be is the one who lies down on the
ground and dreams of the woman he loves.”

There is a quality to the story telling in “The Winds Twist, and Wander” that makes me want to make my
list for the next round. As for the cover artwork, there is just something about what we’ve been doing for three or four issues that I have always thought, and like, and think could be done in some other ways. A lot of artists really like doing cover art. I don’t think I have ever sat down and said to anyone that they should do a “cover” for this story. I think that the cover of an issue should be in keeping with the story inside. (And then the covers come out, and I think I never really liked the covers. I still don’t.

What other changes and things are you looking forward to seeing with the third season?

There are a few changes that I’m looking forward to seeing. But I don’t want to give any spoilers here. I will say that all the way up to issue #24, which is the season finale, there are a few major things that happen that will certainly change the scope of the series, hopefully for the better.

Anything else you want to say about the series, or about yourself as an artist?

If you will remember, I used the phrase in the first installment of this interview that The Fool’s Journey is not going to be what you think it will be. I also said that it would be what you don’t think it will be. It’s always hard to find your niche, but after I get the first installment of the series out, you will see it becoming clear.

I did want to say that I have loved working with Mark Schultz on the covers. We’ve worked together on many things since 1992, and so there’s a shorthand that we have come to share. And I feel that Mark understands the kind of thing I was looking for, and helped shape the style of what turned out to be both the book and the series. Thank you so much to all the readers for reading along. I’m grateful that you have read this far and I hope you will find a moment to take from this interview and share it with the world. So, please keep reading and take a moment to share your thoughts and feelings about The Fool’s Journey with me. And as always, take a moment to check out the series. As always, thank you for reading.

The Fool’s Journey will be in stores on February 23. A preview can be found here! Please consider contributing to help Duffy take a well deserved break before the second story arc is released in 2013.

Dust off those old drawings and write that story about a guy and his dog. It was a great series when I first read it (in the comic book store) and I bought every issue. After the series finished, the books were forgotten about but you can’t go wrong with a good, simple story.

I loved the first series of The Fool’s Journey, but it will be nice to see the story’s future. After all, it is not a series as much as a very long comic book! So many great characters from his past pop up throughout the series. I do look forward to more, I hope it is a nice read.

I will say that I liked your style of storytelling. The series was really nice and it seemed like a slow start, but then things started picking up. It was an interesting series that made me wonder what would happen next. I can’t wait to see what happens next.

I did hear that this story was being planned to be a huge arc. Which would certainly be cool. I’ve just noticed that for the past couple of years, there haven’t been too many new series out, but everyone is excited about this one.

This story may seem slow to start, but I’m sure a lot of people haven’t followed previous stories. This story seems to be taking place at a later time after previous events.

I’m looking forward to next year and this story. I’m looking forward to seeing what new things will happen.

I absolutely loved your take on Mark Twain’s writing style. I am a huge fan of the Fool’s Journey comic book series. I loved the artwork and I loved seeing how the storyline evolved. In fact, I read The Fool’s Journey because it was an homage to Twain’s style. I would love to see more comics that are inspired by his writing style. The stories in your comics are very refreshing and have the classic Mark Twain quality.

I don’t recall any of the book titles from this series, but I really enjoyed reading all the comics you suggested. I love how you incorporated the little details that give the stories so much life. There is a subtle touch of realism in all the stories that I can’t wait to see in more of your comic books.

I am looking forward to the next installment of The Fool’s Journey comic book series. So far, I have enjoyed all the comics you have suggested and I look forward to checking out more of them.

Thank you so much for this interview! The artwork in this interview is really beautiful, especially the covers. I’ve always loved drawings of Mark Twain and all of your covers have been really cool. I think the covers for your comic book series are also really good. Also, I’m looking forward to the next volume of Fool’s Journey as well as the other series that you have done. I think I have the order mixed up, but I think the next comic book you did is about a boy who goes to Vietnam and his brother goes AWOL.

If you could make a crossover with someone’s character in one of your other series, who would it be? If it wasn’t too hard, do you have any other characters in mind that you would like to see in another series? I think Jack Spicer from The Fool’s Journey would be a good character to crossover into Wonder Woman.

I like your take on Twain’s writing style in “The Fool’s Journey”. I’ve been reading books by Mark Twain for years and your cover is great! I saw you talk about “The Fool’s Journey” at the Chicago Comic and Entertainment Convention back in 2008. I’m looking forward to reading more of your stories</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:57
