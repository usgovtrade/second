“The whambulance was amazing. I got a large order of flowers to decorate my son's high school stadium and my home and the whambulance came in handy. The weatherman was calling for rain for the whole week leading up to the event and my family and friends were worried about my decorations. I used the whambulance instead of the traditional steel barrels. I was able to get all of my flowers in their right place to avoid any disasters, and my whambulance is still looking fresh and vibrant right now as well. I would definitely recommend the whambulance to anyone!” – Brittany T.

“I wanted to let you know that this whambulance did indeed make our football game more fun! My dad is the coach, and he used it for the concession stand. It made the whole week leading up to the game more exciting! Our team won, so, therefore, everything was fun!” – Lauren L.

“I used the Whambulance to decorate my new outdoor space. I was worried that the rain would ruin my decorations for my big day, and the whambulance turned out to be just what I needed. Now I am looking forward to throwing parties and family gatherings! The whambulance really is a game-changer. You guys have made it much easier for me to host a good time.” – Alyssa B.

“My friends and family had been talking about getting a whambulance for some time, and I finally broke down and bought one. It took us a bit to set it up and get the hang of how to use it, but now I have a great place to display all of my fresh flowers for the holidays. Thanks so much.” – Jessica S.

“Our home was recently placed on the market and I needed to do some work to improve the curb appeal of our house. My wife has always loved the look of flowers, but our lawn does not look very well kept. We decided to see if we could jazz it up and give our yard a fresh look. My wife said it was absolutely amazing and she can not wait to put it out this summer when we redo the flower beds. I hope you have great success with your business.” – David R.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:58
