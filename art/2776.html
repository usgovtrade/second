Carp, who spoke during a panel event at the African Hunting and Conservation Expo in South Africa, revealed he was aware of the controversy and defended the group’s stance, reports Telegraph.

“A lion like Satao has a big personality,” said Carp.

“So maybe it’s that people have not understood the value of the lions and what they mean for the species. But we are trying to create awareness and that will make people understand the importance of the king of the jungle.”

Carp went on to claim that the king of the jungle is under threat.

“It’s more important now than ever before,” he said.

“When you consider the lions and what they are losing to poachers, they are becoming fewer and fewer. Without lions there is no life. If you cannot have one you cannot have the other.”

The hunting event will reportedly feature a leopard hunt, lion hunt, elephant and rhino hunt, tiger and buffalo hunt, hyena and wild dog hunt.

“People come to our conservation hunting and hunting safaris to experience something they never have before,” explained Carp. “I’m just getting a feel for it. I am a professional hunter and my goal is to help the people we are doing the event with help protect these animals.

“I am a hunter and passionate about the animals in general and when I came across their plight I thought, ‘How can I help?’ It’s a once in a lifetime thing to be able to do, to meet people from across the world.

“I am very passionate and I feel like I have a duty to the people we’re meeting to help them protect what they are looking at.”

“This is going to be an absolutely huge event.”

“The funds that come from a game reserve, for example, are used to protect animals.”

“It’s a very important part of conservation. There is no way one can preserve something like an elephant without hunting. Without poaching.”

The hunting event will run for a week from December 20 to 27 at the North West Province’s Khulaan Naudé hunting area in Rustenburg, reports The Sun.

Fur seals have become common enough on Tasmania's southwest coast to have earned a name: the "Lone Male Beaches".

A couple of kilometres north of Triabunna and a couple of kilometres south of Triabunna is the lone male beaching. I’m going to show you what it’s like at the moment because I’m standing on it.

Just the other week, we had a real-life drama down here where we had a beached elephant and the animal handler, the rescuer, had to cut a rope and release an innocent and injured elephant. He couldn’t walk away from his job. It’s too much to ask of a person.

We had a large bull elephant come up this beach and I said to my assistant, ‘we’re going to have to help this one, aren’t we?’ When we assessed the situation we saw there were four to five other bulls up the next headland. They came up this way because of the fresh blood in the water that attracts them in. They were there with that smell of fresh blood in the water. We took photos, I made a phone call and the Department of Primary Industries were the heroes of the day. The rescue vehicle was here in half an hour.

These days, once in a while, the Lone Male Beach is still known to attract Lone Male Beings.

That is why I can honestly say I have been here on days when all of a sudden I have felt a bit alone.

It’s hard to put your finger on why this seems to be the case.

I’ve got a hypothesis: Maybe when the sea is rough and turbulent, the sea conditions have a lot to do with whether or not I feel this way. I guess it could be something about the sea, or the air or the sky.

My sense is it’s something to do with what’s happening in my environment. Is it just as simple as that? It’s kind of scary.

When I was out on the beach a few days ago, it was overcast and it was like that but also that the wind was coming off the south so it felt colder, and drier.

Drier is another thought.

Maybe that’s it.

I’ve thought of this on days when I’ve been alone: I wonder if this could be like something in the psyche of one individual. If a sea was like this on other people’s beaches they would say, ‘why aren’t you on the beach like everyone else?’

But I don’t know, I’m a realist.

Because I feel like this even on a small and very gentle female elephant beach, so that’s not how I think it works.

Maybe if there was a big old man in a wetsuit sitting on a rock that’s where I’d be.

I can see how it happens. But it just doesn’t make any sense to me.

Last year the sea was out in the harbour. It wasn’t rough. It wasn’t rough at all. It was out in the harbour and it was so quiet. You couldn’t hear a thing, or see a thing.

The ocean was like that, but the breeze was coming off the south. It made me feel like I was in a desert.

Or maybe it was me that was in the desert.

I think it’s more likely to do with the wind. I can’t say that for sure.

And I think it’s because of the wind.

These days, whenever I stand on the lonely male beaches, I find myself wondering where the lonely male beings are and why they aren’t here, because I see signs of all of them: in the air and in the sky. You can just tell when something is wrong, when it is off, like there is something wrong with the air.

You just know it’s off.

I don’t know what it is about it, but it’s like I get that feeling when I am alone on the beach here. I just do. Maybe it’s because I feel like there’s something about that place and something about the air, but you can tell it’s not right.

I’ve got a sense of dread about it.

I don’t know why. But that’s what I feel. I think that might be why it scares me.

It makes me want to not stay by the water.

It makes me feel like maybe I shouldn’t stay here, and even if I were to go and walk down the road, I wouldn’t feel safe.

When I do stand on this beach alone, I wonder where the beings are and why they are not here and I see a sense of calm and safety in the air, like it’s almost like being in a safe place.

So I think it’s more to do with the wind.

These days I am feeling a little more concerned and a little more alone.

It’s getting more and more of a feeling.

For me, there’s no getting around it, I just think I might have to choose my beach.

To help out, I am having my local surf lifesavers go over the beach, I’ve told them they need to do a full assessment on the beach and I’ve told them to pick a beach, any beach, but not to bother me.

On the day I am talking about, I am the only one here and I am the only one here, so I guess there is no other beach.

So yes, it is scary for me. But I have to say: maybe</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:38
