"He's a crook." "He's a good thief, he is not." "Come along, boy." "Wiggins, do you see him?" " Not yet, sir." " He's the one..." "Come on, now, boy." "Hah!" "Come on." "Come on, boy." "Come on." "Wiggins, do you see him?" "Keep quiet, and you'll see him!" "Come on." "Yes, I have it." "I have it." "I saw a flash of color," "I think it was white." "In the King's Road." "All right, that's in the King's Road, just by St Martin's Lane." "Mr Gower." "There are men with guns down here." "Keep the boy close by us, eh?" "Mr Mipps." "Wiggins?" "The little one?" "He's asleep." "Sorry, sir." "Look." "Oh, dear, what a pity." "Good night, Mrs Bedwin." " I do beg your pardon." " Good night." "Wiggins, the baby's gone!" "It's gone!" "I know it, Mrs Bedwin!" "I know it!" " It's very simple." " Is it?" "Let's make sure of a few things." "Who brought up the cart?" "Me and Mr Mipps, sir." "All right, now, think very carefully, boy." "What made you go into the cellar?" "Did you see anything that you shouldn't have seen?" "There was one like Bedwin down there." "He was looking for something, he kept pulling it, pulling it out of his pocket." "So you followed him down and eavesdropped." "So you saw the paper in his hand and you took it." "Do you know what you took?" "It's..." "It's a list." "List of what?" "Lots of things." "Names." "Numbers." "Colours." "I've seen it before." "Well, boy, go on." "You found the baby." "I followed you to the King's Road." "You went into the shop, we didn't hang about, I waited outside." "Did you hear me tell him to give me the baby?" " No, sir." " Yes, you did." "No, Mr Mipps did." " No, Mr Mipps did." " Did he say, Mr Gower?" "Yes, he said it." "Thank you, Wiggins." "Well, there we are." "That's very strange." "Mr Gower, you were in the shop, you told the man to give me the baby." " Now..." " Look me in the eyes and say that." "You're in a very dangerous situation, Master Fred." "You're a good boy, aren't you?" "Well, then, you must help us." "Now, I'll just take you to the station, we'll have a chat." "Let's go." "Wait a minute." "Wait." "Here." "Have a couple of those." "You take them, I've had enough." "And you leave Mr Mipps to me, we'll make him see sense." "All right." "I'm a policeman." "I must warn you, we suspect you were planning to kidnap a child." "What?" "Good Lord, are you crazy?" "Have I got a wooden leg or something?" " No, no, nothing like that." " What are you talking about?" "You followed the boy down here, you tried to steal the list, when Mr Gower and Mr Mipps caught you at it..." " Who told you that?" " It's what happened, isn't it?" "Yes, but what happened?" "If it had all gone like you planned, you wouldn't have needed the list, would you?" "And it would have been me that was missing." "We found that rather funny, I must say." "When we realised what you had done, we thought you'd see reason, and come here and hand the baby over quietly." "Mr Gower, who is this man?" "Do you know him?" "Is he a policeman?" "No, I don't know him, I've never seen him before." "I've never seen him before." "I don't know why you have." "He's just some fellow that came to ask us some questions." "Wiggins said that he caught you looking for something down there." "Oh, dear." "I'm sorry, Mr Gower, I just couldn't wait." "When I saw you at the police station..." "We decided that we were going to give the baby up." "I told them that there was nothing to worry about." "Then who is the man?" "What is he to you?" "All right, he's a detective." "We were with the police force in..." "We can't talk here." "Come in the back, let me take you in the back and you tell me all about it." "I'm sorry." "I would like to have taken you home, but it's not me that's got the baby." "If you want to go back to the house, I'll tell them that you are there." "Thank you, Mr Gower." "Let's just get this over with, shall we?" "We've brought you something that was left for you at a shop where you used to work." "Mr Gower has explained everything." "We don't need to put the baby down." "Let me see it." " Is that where it belongs?" " Yes." "The poor little thing." "Do you mind?" "You won't need that." "I'll take the baby." "Now, what's the matter?" "He's mine." "I'm sorry." "If that's not mine, whose is it?" " You'd better tell him, Wiggins." " It belongs to Mr Bedwin." "That poor old gentleman you work for." "He is too weak, I'm afraid." "But I shall look after him, I promise." "All right, all right." "Mr Bedwin is not as helpless as you think." "Please, sir, don't say anything to him, please." "I think that's probably enough for one day, Master Fred." "Yes." " Thank you, Inspector." " Yes, yes." " Thank you very much, Inspector." " Goodbye." "Goodbye, Inspector." "Wiggins!" "Well, I didn't get very far with him, did I?" "Oh, Wiggins, I feel so much better now." "Tell Mr Gower that I'm here, please, and that I'm looking forward to seeing him again." "Please, Wiggins." " Goodbye, Inspector." " Goodbye." "Wiggins, go and tell Mr Gower that I'm here." "Tell him I'm looking forward to seeing him again." "Wiggins, go and tell Mr Gower that I'm here." "He's gone." "Gone?" "Gone where?" "That's what I can't seem to understand." "Who's that there?" "Mr Gower!" "You're back already!" "How..." " How did you get in?" " Through the window." "He's come back." "Gower!" "Gower!" "I'm sorry to surprise you like this, but I want you to help me." " Gower!" " Gower!" "Gower!" " He's in here!" " Oh, God, please help me!" "Gower!" "There you are." "We were beginning to think you'd gone back on your word." "Mr Gower, I don't want him in here!" "You see what he's done to me!" "He's broken my little finger!" "Oh, darling." "Where is it?" "Where is the list?" "Gower has it." "I'm so..." "I'm so sorry." "I'm sorry, Mabel." "What did you do with the list?" "I think she's killed him." "Well, I think we must get help." "Help!" "Mabel!" "Oh, what have you done to me?" "Mabel!" "Mabel!" "What have you done to me?" "What have you done to me?" "Help!" "Help me!" "Somebody, help me!" " Mabel!" " Mabel!" "Mabel, come back!" "Please help me, somebody!" "Come back!" "Mabel!" "Mabel!" "Stop it!" "Please!" "Stop it!" "Stop it!" "Stop it!" "Please stop it!" "For God's sake, get out of here!" "Fred!" "Fred!" "Where are you?" "Fred!" "Come on, old man." "I'm up here." "Where's the list?" "I burnt it." "Why did you burn it?" "It was blackmail, wasn't it?" "What did you do with the boy?" "He's not the boy, Inspector." "He's a man." "He changed into one." "He's dead." "He might have changed into a man before he died, but he didn't die." "I don't know what you mean." "But I do." "You took Fred's body and you buried him in the cellar." "But you've been playing some kind of cruel joke</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:57
