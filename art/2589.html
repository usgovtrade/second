I'm post-op now... So I just went through an operation that got me a new breast! This surgery was done before. If I have post-op issues, I've only just had the surgery. In this picture, I had a different size on my breasts, but the surgery was the same. This is after the reduction that made them smaller in size. The breast reduction was on a different date from this one."

2. On her relationship with boyfriend Chris Brown: Lolita: I see the relationship as being happy for now. We went on a date to the movies. We're trying to have some fun and see where it goes. I have a busy life and can't spend all my time on him. The last thing I want to see is myself with somebody who's not even interested in what I'm doing right now. I have a lot of things going on.

3. Her next TV project: Lolita: I'm working on a variety show. I don't know when it will air. We have meetings every week with the network. We're having meetings with people right now about what we want and how it can get to the networks in a different way."

4. Her reaction to the "Lolita" controversy: Lolita: The "Lolita" film was made when I was 14. All of the fans who saw it know that I wasn't 14 in that film. Even though it was a very provocative role, I was always careful to never break my morals or tell anyone to do something they wouldn't. I would never say to go on and do it. To have someone try to use the film to make me look like a bad person is wrong. I've never had anything bad said about me for being in the movie. I've always had the same respect from the young people who watched it and the same support from the rest of the world. People love to talk about it; people love to use it as a big point. It's all in the past and it's not my business to be dealing with. I have no control over it. I don't know how it happened. It's all out there, and to try to bring it back is just crazy.

5. Thoughts on "Gossip Girl": Lolita: I've only had a chance to look at the pilot. That show is very interesting. It's so cool for a TV show. It shows how much people are into it. Everyone wants to be like that because it's the 21st century."

6. The media frenzy surrounding her: Lolita: I can't stand being an everyday person and having all that focus. I'm not a celebrity. I'm a celebrity that just has my own name, just like every other person out there."

7. Her favorite television shows: Lolita: "Biggest Loser," "America's Next Top Model," "My Super Sweet 16," and "Top Chef."

8. Her favorite film: Lolita: I love the movie "Monster." I love the thriller, horror and comedies."

9. Catch her in a television commercial: Lolita: "I did an ad for the Guess Collection. The photographer was just amazing. We did so many things. I can't wait to go to the premiere because I can't wait for it to be out."

10. How she's doing in school: Lolita: I'll be in school in LA when the school year starts. I have three months of summer, so it'll be the summer at Harvard."

11. She's making friends in Hollywood: Lolita: It's so funny to me to hear people talk about me, because I love it. I had a chance to see "Twilight" before it came out, and I had a chance to see "Harry Potter," and I have to tell you, I didn't notice anything different about me. I'm not looking like a different person. I went to the premiere. They changed it a little bit, but it was OK. People were talking about me and thinking that they looked different. They weren't. People like me in LA really make me laugh. They don't give me that much to think about."

11. "I love to read books," she says. "A lot of the books I've read have had a message and some really dark stuff. "

11. "But," she says, "there is no one book that stands out."

12. How she'll describe herself: Lolita: That's funny because I don't know. There isn't a word I could use to describe myself. I don't know how to explain it."

13. On her friends: Lolita: I have wonderful friends. I have wonderful people that are always giving me a smile every day, and that's really nice. I love everyone here because they bring out my best."

14. Her love life: Lolita: "None of this would have happened if I didn't like talking about love. I've learned a lot about love. It's crazy to think that some people only want to talk about their work because it's the way they make money and then talk about love on their day off."

15. What she has planned for the future: Lolita: "This was my first time at the MTV VMAs, and I'm going to do this all over again. You just can't sit and complain about everything. That's not the way to go about things."

About Me

I have been a NYT and Washington Post bestselling author for almost two decades, writing both fiction and nonfiction books for young readers. For my teen and children's books I use my married name, Linda Chapman. I never use the names Linda or Lindsay on the blogs, although I'm known by both names. I write about everything from dating and divorce to peer pressure and adult themes. You can reach me at lindac@yahoo.com.

I've had several articles and stories published in both the NYT and the Washington Post.

What I like to do most, though, is to travel. I've been on three USO tours, two to Asia, one to the Middle East. I've been all over the country from Hawaii to St. Louis to Alaska and many places in between. Most recently I visited Honduras where my sister and brother-in-law work with Mission Aviation Fellowship. I write about many of these adventures on my blog, Plane Truths.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:45
