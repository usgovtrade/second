looking for a father figure," Mom said sternly.  "And besides, I'm sure 
this has absolutely nothing to do with your upcoming nuptials."

Tiff was about to say something snappy back when the cell phone 
interrupted with the familiar tinny "Pop up a Squirt" sound that all 
smart phones do.  But this one wasn't a standard phone.  The caller 
identity box said "I am Mr. Big"; and it was sitting on a black velour 
lap.  The phone was attached to a long velvety sleeve and had a little 
pink felt heart at the bottom that said "I love you.  Tiffy."  In the 
corner was a picture of a big red rose, and the velvety sleeve was 
decorated with hundreds of tiny pink and yellow flowers.

"Oh my gosh!" Tiff said as she looked down at the phone. "He's 
brought me a heart. Is he trying to tell me something?" She bent over 
and studied the heart more closely, and it all became clear. "Oh my 
gosh! It's not a real heart! It's a stethoscope! Who would bring me a 
stethoscope? Why?"

"I was sure you would know, child." Said Mom in a teasing voice.

"Dad, I don't know what to do."

"Just do what any good loving wife would do," Dad teased. "Just get 
him on the table."

"Dad! I'm sorry, but I think that's one thing I never wanted to 
happen!"

"Okay, then just put it on the bed," Dad countered.

"But, oh, geez, Dad!" Tiff ran into the bedroom and brought out an 
extra, flat bed she had lying around somewhere, brought it into the 
kitchen, then dropped onto it dramatically. "Okay, Dad, get ready!" 
she said to the doctor. 
"Wait!" Dad's voice boomed loudly from the bedroom. "You two are 
talking about me!"

"Okay, okay," Mom called back as she walked into the kitchen. "Go 
ahead."

"Well," Tiff started, "I've been trying to make an appointment with 
Dr. M for months now, but my mother wouldn't let me go and there are no 
openings for an older teen at my local clinic." 
"No wonder." Mom said. "The pediatrics department will have to be 
closed in three years. Too bad, so sad. A clinic needs the income."

"A stethoscope!" Mom remembered with sudden insight. "Of course! You 
are too old for pediatrics! The stethoscopes must mean that he is 
wanting you to get an ob-gyn exam. That's how the stethoscope usually 
works."

"So I guess that means I should talk to my dad about doing ob-gyn." 
Tiff said. 
"Wait a minute!" Mom said. "Why are you talking about ob-gyn? You're 
not planning to have sex, are you?"

"No!" Tiff said, horrified. "I just want to have a doctor's 
examinations so I can find out if I'm doing what I'm supposed to be 
doing," she added quietly. 
"You know what they say. 
No sex, no fun. 
Right, Dad?"

"Huh?" Dad said. "I was gone for most of the conversation."

"Anyway, what we need to do now is get her an ob-gyn. We'll have to 
go to St. Ives to see Dr. Uta."

"What?" Mom asked. "An ob-gyn?"

"Yes." Tiff replied. "Because my parents refuse to spend any of the 
extra money in the budget on me unless they think I'm preparing for 
kids, she's offering to do it for cheap."

"Oh, no! Not you! Oh!" Mom wailed. "Not you! You're so pretty! You're 
going to kill your dad. Did he go to see the doctor?"

"No." Tiff said. "He has the flu. He should be back tomorrow."

"Then your mom can go!" Mom said happily. "I want to spend the day 
with my girl."

"Can we?" Tiff asked, almost inaudibly. 
"All you have to do is eat an unopened can of green beans. I swear 
there isn't any fun stuff in them." 
"I'm not eating them!" Tiff said. "Why would I? You eat them! You 
swallow them!" 
"Not really." Mom admitted. "I only eat them because I'm afraid I'll 
get the flu if I don't eat them, and I have to eat them or you'll get 
mad at me. But you don't have to eat them if you don't want to."

"Good! Let's go!" Tiff said excitedly. "Dr. M is going to give me an 
ob-gyn!"

ought to stop praying? When we have used up all the words in the 
dictionary! (Attributed to David Brainerd, missionary to the Native 
Americans)

Hold on tight.
