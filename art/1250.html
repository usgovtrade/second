What a fabulous list of films! I cannot wait to get there, and hopefully see some of these movies! As for what we are seeing: I went with the kids to see Captain America and X-Men movies (both of which we loved) at the Paris Cinema. And now we’re hoping to catch some of the Euro Cup games on TV…

Terrific list of movies to see. It does make me a little sad that you didn’t see Waking Ned Devine or Pride and Prejudice but there are plenty of other good movies. We have actually seen several of these movies so I would have to pick The English Patient as my fave movie and The Thomas Crown Affair as my second favorite. Have a great trip and thanks for sharing this!

Wow. There’s quite a few. There are a lot of the classics out there that I’ve seen a couple times already. Of the new releases that I haven’t seen, I can definitely say I’d like to check out Waltz with Bashir.

I am so in love with the movie Captain Corect. I can’t say enough about how much I love it! But a list like this is awesome for those of us in New York. We always visit the movie theaters in New York. Enjoy it! I lived in Paris during my studies at the Sorbonne and love to travel to France. I live in Florida now, so it’s on my travel wish list for retirement! Thanks! Love it!

I love those French movies! We’re missing some classics that are at least now out on Blu-ray, but we have others. My favorite movie of the year was Les Miserables, mostly because I was singing along with every word…my husband was not a fan of the French language version (and not just because we’ve seen it a few times already).

I’m getting excited about my upcoming trip to Paris! I’ll try to check out some of these, if I can squeeze them in…and there’s plenty more that I wouldn’t mind seeing, as well. Thanks for the list!

We just spent 3 days in Paris recently and there were times I just looked at the wall behind our bench to escape the heat and enjoy a movie. We saw so many…I’m so glad we didn’t rush through the films on your list – I may have missed a few. Thanks for sharing your tips. I’m planning to join some friends there and it’s good to know that a few of them have already seen a few of these films. Thanks for the opportunity to win the travel pack!

Fantastic choices…there were two movies that we missed that you missed…Waking Ned Devine and Waltz With Bashir. But that’s just because we happened to run out of time before it ended and we didn’t have a chance to catch it. Thank you for sharing!

This is a great list. I saw the Captain Corect movie but missed the others, so I’m looking forward to seeing them on DVD or blu-ray soon. We live in France so we have many of these films. A few movies I like in France is “Spirited Away”, “The Notebook”, “Saving Private Ryan” or “The Silence of the Lambs” (just to mention a few). Have a great trip!

I’m always drawn to things that offer the ultimate escape, and I am so glad to see that there are great things to do in this case. I really enjoyed Les Miserables, and now I cannot wait to see what you recommend here! Thanks so much for the wonderful list.

Watching that movie is one of the most beautiful experiences I’ve had in a long time. We were</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:40
