Life Insurance

You should carefully consider the interest rate used in your MetLife life insurance policy. There are various factors that could affect the rates used, including (i) the time you have the policy, (ii) any changes in interest rates, and (iii) the type of policy you are offered. These rates are set as of the issue date.

Your payment options

Your MetLife payment options for your life insurance policy are determined by your individual plan design. These are set as of the issue date. A change in the amounts charged or in the method of payment to any one of your payment options might be made at any time.

If you would like to learn more about our insurance products, the features of each type of policy, and the costs associated with each, please contact your MetLife Agent at 800-247-4282 or the phone number located on your policy documents.

You will receive a free copy of your MetLife Individual Annuity Disclosure Document (the "Individual Annuity Disclosure Document") within 10 business days of receipt of your request. The Individual Annuity Disclosure Document provides details on each MetLife insurance policy we offer. The Individual Annuity Disclosure Document will explain whether you must choose between a certain level of cash value accumulation or a minimum death benefit. It also discusses charges and any benefits. A separate booklet (disclosing the contract terms and conditions) will be sent to you.

Under certain conditions, you may change the face amount of your MetLife life insurance policy by making a written request within 30 days after the policy anniversary month that follows the policy anniversary month in which your death occurred, to one of your MetLife agents. In the event you wish to change the face amount, you must sign and date the request for change of face amount and return it to your MetLife agent with all documentation required to support your change. Failure to complete this process could cause your request to be rejected. We require proof of your identity, change of ownership, change of address and written notice. If you cancel any coverage within the first 12 months, the premium will be returned, less any non-refundable fees.

The amount you wish to change will be subject to available policy cash values and other features such as the date and age of issue, whether it is a life, term, universal, or variable product and the policyâ€™s current premiums. Any changes requested during the first two years of the contract will apply to your new insurance only. Any changes requested within the first year will be applied to your existing life insurance policy. After the first year, no changes can be made to an existing policy. We may not be able to make the change you request. The cost of your insurance policy and related services are based upon numerous factors and will vary depending upon your age, state of health, and the time remaining until your next premium due date. It is important to review these factors carefully in deciding on the amount of life insurance that you need.
