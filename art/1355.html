This is a nice read and a good example of how a new game can be built in such a way that it expands on the ideas of a familiar game.

We're also getting reports that this game is, to some degree, a more sophisticated version of a popular game released on Gog where players try to survive against the elements by killing zombies and collecting items and resources. While we've been told this is not currently a feature of this game, if it ever is this game will certainly face some big questions about what it does to that game's audience and how it tries to stand on its own.

We've heard and seen this game, and its makers, talked about a bit recently in connection to games called Escape from Tarkov and H1Z1. We haven't seen the gameplay ourselves, but we're wondering if this new game is actually based on this other game. If so, then they might have to walk an interesting line, especially if the game does have Zombies as a playable class.

So far, we've been told that only the publisher, Chimera Project, is being silent about the project. We've also been told that a lot of this is being created in-house as "contract work" and that it is a game that is, at the moment, in the early stages of development. As we've mentioned, Chimera Project is one of the publishers we'd previously expected to put out something from the H1Z1 team, which makes us wonder what this game is for Chimera Project.

We reached out to both Chimera Project and Lince Works and we're awaiting a response.

I had the same thought as another poster in regards to the name. I was thinking that it might be for the Lince Works team (Lince Works, not Chimera Project, apparently have a side-project going called The Long Dark). I could see them deciding to collaborate with Lince Works on a game to make up for any bad blood.

So that's a possibility. But now that I'm thinking about it, I wonder if I'm wrong. I guess it's possible the publishers are using each other to make up for different projects that failed. But that would seem to go against a few things in this article (and not in the first comment). For instance, the article states that, "weâ€™re also told that this game is not actually part of H1Z1." Yet the first comment does say it's a new zombie survival game, not that it's connected to H1Z1. The comment also doesn't mention a publisher, and the article mentions Chimera Project. The other thing the comment points out, but the article doesn't, is the use of the word "new". I would agree that the game being "new" does imply that it's not related to H1Z1, but it doesn't prove that. Especially because there's been no word about it from either Chimera Project or Lince Works.

I dunno. It's a mystery, at least for now.

I do see how they could try to keep both projects a secret, because if anyone asks, there won't be anything but silence.

No game that has been built in the past decade needs an excuse to make money. They only need the right people to make an audience for them. And for a small indie studio they don't need to fear people jumping ship as long as they don't completely cock it up.

If anything, I think that this is more evidence that the only game we're seeing is actually the one they've already started. But I agree, these days you could probably make your game anyways you want, because the market is huge. Not in a bad way, though. And while you'll still face obstacles in the future (obvious one is piracy), you're not facing near as much as you did back then.

A "new" game that makes money? Or... a new game that makes a decent chunk of money... perhaps like, $5 mil a year or so? I'd say that'd make it "not a failure"

This is not a new game - it's not even the same game - but yet, its on Kickstarter. How much of this would of had to exist for it to be a new and innovative game? If it existed already and was making money for a year I don't think Kickstarter would of been a necessary choice. The game we see may not be a new "experiment" but a re-skin of something that isn't quite as popular yet, so "new" isn't the right word.

Yes, I'm a terrible business man but so is 90% of everything else here. No need to be that smug about it unless you really did something interesting with a kickstarter game like Minecraft that is the first and only success in the last decade. But I digress.

Kickstarter is about ideas and passion. There's nothing wrong with either. I hope that this game comes to fruition, and if it does I don't want to be an asshole about it because it's the exact opposite of what that whole article talks about.

Kickstarter should be used to fund things that haven't been thought of.

What if, in the future, we're able to just throw $15,000 at something and it turns out really awesome?

Would that make it less of a Kickstarter success? Less about ideas, passion, and the unknown?

It seems like, to me, Kickstarter is designed to fund games that already exist - I think in their infancy. It's what it means to be a "success" to a lot of people. If a Kickstarter game turns out to be just as mediocre as a traditional game studio (though, with an idea that existed for 10 years and had been funded on its own), how do you measure success?

I don't think any "indie" would do any less than what they're trying to do here, especially now. I understand how you might be getting that impression.

Kickstarter is all about funding for games that are not yet realized, not yet funded. It's why people use Kickstarter, it's the purpose of Kickstarter, not to fund things already being made. If the games were all just sequels or some version of something already being sold in stores, then I can see your point.

That's fine, but what they said should have been worded slightly better so you don't have to twist it to mean something it doesn't, or you should have read it more closely to understand what they meant by it.

That being said, I'm not against it as much as most other people. If they are just making money on some of these already popular ideas that only change, I don't see anything wrong with that.

No Kickstarter "startup" will ever need a Kickstarter again because in the future we'll all just have a Kickstarter account that you're funding every time you buy a game, and we'll just update the balance for you when you purchase a game with a credit card and not your bank account.

For instance, I've got a Kickstarter game sitting on my backlog. Well, one of the rewards on the card is to be able to pre-order the game. I'll do that, get the pre-order, and when the game comes out, the card will get updated with all my future purchases. I'll be able to keep track of my progress as if it were a pre-order model instead of a Kickstarter game with one big difference: when I pre-order a game, I'm usually funding it ahead of time (unless the game requires some physical component).

So while you might say there's some added risk with Kickstarter since there's some added financial risk involved, it's not like you're starting a business based on it. In the case of a "Kickstarter game" that also has a physical component like an adventure game, a Kickstarter campaign should have funding on day one, which is still completely different from a Kickstarter game that requires some level of pre-funding, like the first few days in the Kickstarter campaign for H1Z1 or Minecraft.

The risk with Kickstarter is not financial risk. It's the risk that your Kickstarter game will turn out to be shit, whether from lack of funding or lack of ideas, and the fact that this is an un-auditable and un-trackable form of funding does nothing to remedy this.

Yes, I understand that Kickstarter, like any crowdfunding campaign, has the risk of it being a dud. You know, the same risk that exists with any game, whether it's traditional in nature or not.

However, I would argue that we've also seen the same risk with traditional publishers. Look at the recent reports of a video game being in a "playable" form... but then being canceled because the developer couldn't figure out how to make money off of it.

This is where the benefit of Kickstarter comes into play. There's more</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:49
