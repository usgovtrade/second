That is going to complicate 
everything!!  We don't know the outcome of the litigation.  It might be 
nothing and the deal may still go forward.  It might be that the matter is 
resolved in a fashion favorable to us, in which case we're OK, or in a 
fashion unfavorable to us.   We don't have enough info right now to know the 
answer to any of these questions.   Let's not muck things up further 
throwing in that "what if this doesn't go forward" or that "even if this 
comes back our way it won't work because a certain individual won't approve 
of the transaction" scenario.  We'll wait for the deal to go forward or not 
as the facts dictate.

By the way, I got a call yesterday from our IT group's risk person regarding 
the "pitch" she received from someone wanting to set up an office for an 
internet auction house.  She called our lawyer and made an appointment to 
meet with her to discuss the matter.  No need to worry about that.

Regards,

Rob

Is anyone going to talk to Jeff about the NewCo thing?  I think I'm on 
record as saying I do not want to be part of something like that.  

Let me know.
