I’m SO excited! So much so that I am not able to contain my excitement!! We are officially announced to be opening in March!!

This is a very important announcement for us, as it means that we are now officially approved by the state, and it also means we can begin gathering our team.

We are still trying to secure funding for construction, and can now do that as well.

If you love us as much as we love you, help us in spreading the word about our restaurant. Re-Tweet this blog and share your favorite dish on a future visit. We will make you happy with every bite!!

Welcome to Daniel & Friends! We are a small and local vegan eatery coming soon to Southwestern PA.

D & F plans on being a restaurant that is approachable, friendly and delicious. Our ingredients are organic and locally sourced whenever possible. We will offer a healthy menu of vegan breakfast, lunch and dinner items, as well as catering to gluten-free, wheat free, grain-free and Paleo diets. You can expect to see gluten-free pizzas and delicious desserts as well. We will also have a few cocktails on hand for the grown-up crowd.

We are so proud of the progress we have made and are so excited to introduce to you the first of what will be many new menu items! Please take a look and let us know what you think!

In order for us to have the best product possible, we need the best ingredients possible. Our strawberries are organic and locally grown, and our organic lemon juice is hand squeezed at the source. This means that it is more natural and fresh than if we simply made it here.
