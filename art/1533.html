And the song is used for the season 1 ending.

You can watch the full trailer here.

[I can now officially quote it for you]:

You must be able to listen to the full version of the song, which can be found here.

How awesome is that?

Of course, it was probably obvious from a mile away, but the song is, of course, "Go Your Own Way".

The trailer was released March 12th and "I Have the Advantage, for Once" and "Go Your Own Way" were released as part of the Supernatural Season 12 soundtrack the following day.

Check out the full lyrics below!

"I Have the Advantage...For Once":

Advantage is to hold on tight

And never let go when your lips are cold, frozen

And the wind is blowing and it’s cold and you’re shivering on your own

And you’re thinking this might be the end

No use in letting go

No use in letting go

I have the advantage, for once

And I intend to make the most of it

No use in letting go

No use in letting go

I have the advantage, for once

I’m gonna make the most of it

And I know I can be one of a kind

And I’m gonna fight till I know that you’re mine

And I’m gonna stand by your side

And I’m gonna run the whole race with you

And you may not ever need me to say it

No use in letting go

No use in letting go

I have the advantage, for once

And I intend to make the most of it

No use in letting go

No use in letting go

I have the advantage, for once

I’m gonna make the most of it

And I'm gonna make the most of it

And I'm gonna make the most of it

And I’m gonna make the most of it

Go your own way

No, no, you’re better off without me

No use in letting go

And I say this all the time

No use in letting go

Go your own way

I’m gonna go my own way

I’m gonna go my own way

I’m gonna go my own way

"Go Your Own Way":

Hey baby, here I stand like an open book

And I'm gonna tell you every single page

And I'm gonna show you who I am

And if you’re into the things that I do

Well, baby, here I stand like an open book

Go your own way, babe

No use in talking 'bout it

Don't get it twisted now

Baby, here I stand like an open book

Go your own way, babe

No use in talking 'bout it

Don't get it twisted now

Go your own way, babe

No use in talking 'bout it

Don't get it twisted now

Go your own way, babe

No use in talking 'bout it

Don't get it twisted now

I've heard every line, babe

Tried to please you night and day

But there's one thing I should have told you

It's just the way that it is

Hey baby, here I stand like an open book

And I'm gonna tell you every single page

And I'm gonna show you who I am

And if you're into the things that I do

Well, baby, here I stand like an open book

Go your own way, babe

Go your own way, babe

No use in talking 'bout it

Don't get it twisted now

Baby, here I stand like an open book

Go your own way, babe"
