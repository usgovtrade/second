The present invention relates to a display apparatus, and more particularly, to a display apparatus which displays an image by forming a color corresponding to an image signal transmitted from the outside by using a driving method selected from a plurality of driving methods.
2. Description of the Related Art
Currently, a flat panel display apparatus is replacing a cathode ray tube (CRT) having a large volume in association with developments in semiconductor technologies and an information communication field. Such a flat panel display apparatus includes a liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, and the like.
In particular, the LCD and the OLED display generally include two panels respectively formed with two kinds of field generating electrodes such as pixel electrodes and a common electrode and an optical anisotropic liquid interposed therebetween. The LCD includes a liquid crystal panel as an upper panel for displaying an image and a polarizing plate as a lower panel for passing or blocking light emitted from the liquid crystal panel. In this case, the liquid crystal panel includes a color filter for rendering the light in predetermined wavelengths, and a liquid crystal layer for passing the light emitted from the backlight assembly to the upper panel. The polarizing plate converts light into linearly polarized light, and the optical anisotropy of the liquid crystal layer has an aspect that is adjusted by adjusting an electric field formed between the pixel electrodes and the common electrode, to allow the light converted into the linearly polarized light by the polarizing plate to be changed into a desired polarized light.
The optical anisotropy of the liquid crystal includes an initial alignment and a liquid crystal alignment which is a molecular arrangement formed by the liquid crystal due to a direct current voltage applied to the two panels. When the alignment of the liquid crystal is converted into a predetermined arrangement due to an alternating current voltage applied from an external driving circuit and an electric field is changed to have a uniform direction, light emitted from the backlight assembly is changed into the linearly polarized light, and thus it is possible to display images.
In the case of the LCD, since the liquid crystal panel does not emit light, a backlight assembly is provided at a rear side of the liquid crystal panel and thus the images are displayed by using light emitted from the backlight assembly. As a light source, cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) are mainly used.
In general, light emitted from the backlight assembly passes through the polarizing plate and is converted into polarized light such that only light of a particular orientation may pass through the polarizing plate. Therefore, it is required that the polarizing plate has an initial alignment such that the light of the particular orientation may pass through the polarizing plate, and has properties that the light transmittance is constant.
However, in the case of a color filter used for the liquid crystal panel, since it is difficult to manufacture the color filter such that all color light waves emitted from the backlight assembly are uniformly arranged, light of a wavelength different from that of the initial alignment may not be completely transmitted to form a light color distortion.
As a solution of the problem, the polarizing plate may be used together with a color polarizer which absorbs and blocks light having a wavelength different from a color of the color filter, or the polarizing plate may be made of a material having more excellent polarization characteristics than before. However, a light transmittance of a liquid crystal display panel in this case is still not 100%, which deteriorates a display contrast and an overall quality of the panel.
In the case of the OLED display, an organic light emitting diode is used as a pixel to emit light using a potential difference formed by injecting electrons and holes to an organic compound film. The OLED display may display an image of various colors due to the luminescent property of the organic compound film.
In particular, since the OLED display is self-emitting, the OLED display has advantages in contrast, power consumption, and viewing angle over the liquid crystal display. However, a disadvantage of the OLED display is that a life span thereof is lower than that of the liquid crystal display. In order to solve the disadvantage, a method of extending a life span of the OLED by applying a color correction film has been developed.
However, such a color correction film is required to have color correction characteristics that may approximate intrinsic color reproduction characteristics of the OLED, and also may be easily manufactured. Therefore, a color reproduction region of the color correction film must have a wider area than that of the OLED, and thus a display device including the OLED display is not sufficient in a display quality.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:30
