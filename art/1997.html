The video begins with a flash of light and then a few black and white screens appear and go by quickly. Several shots of a street in New York City go by before we are introduced to some of the song's vocalists. Then, during the second verse of the song, we are in a desert and some vehicles are driving down a road (the same shot used in the preceding video for "Guns N' Roses").

In Australia, the music video for "The Garden" aired in May 1998. The video begins with a voice stating that "Bands come and go", as seen on a tombstone and also in the video for "Not in This Lifetime". This is followed by various shots of a woman. When the first verse starts, a black male figure is shown running through a forest. When the chorus starts, the female is seen again. When she throws a flower onto the male, she is then shown again. When the verse changes, she is shown walking in a field. Then a black figure is shown. Then we see the man from before, and another black figure. Then, at the end of the video, the band are seen playing in a forest.

Alternate version
An alternate version was directed by Phil Griffin and Michael Binger. They had previously directed the music videos for "Nine Inch Nails", "Dope" and "The Perfect Drug". A short snippet of the video was shown at the NIN Live:1997 concert film during the song "Piggy". The video was shown on VH1 when the series Playlist was first aired.

In popular culture
The song appeared in the 2018 racing video game Forza Horizon 4 as well as the 2016 racing video game Forza Motorsport 7 as a free downloadable content and the 2010 computer game Fable III.
