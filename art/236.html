attracted to a married man." 
"That woman is not my mother," I insisted, wishing she'd get to the point. 
"I think we should take some time off from discussing this," she continued 
as she lifted my sweater off of my shoulders. "Let's put some music on." She 
moved around the room until she found some soft rock music, then she 
seated herself in my living room's love seat. "Cuddle up with me." 
"This is making me uncomfortable," I snapped. "Why are you doing this?" 
"To help you understand, that's why," she answered. "The truth is that you 
and I have a lot in common, and I want you to help me make an important 
decision about something. I can't decide whether to take my husband back." 
"Why not?" I asked. "You haven't done anything wrong, have you?" 
"There are things about him that I can't stand. But then there are things 
about him that I've come to love. To decide is hard." 
"Well if you need my help, then I'll help you decide," I said with a little 
smile on my face to disarm her. 
"I thought you'd see it from my perspective," she answered. "You know what? 
I think I like you." 
"You're married and he's not," I answered. 
"I know," she answered. "But you're not, and he is." 
"That's irrelevant." 
"Are you certain?" 
"Yeah," I said. "I'm just confused because I was under the impression that 
I was the one you didn't want anymore." 
"Well, now that he's back, I'm trying to decide if I can live with him." 
"I really don't care about your marriage or his affairs," she added. 
"Okay, I know that you need to decide if you're going to take him back." 
"And I need to decide if I should." 
"Can I ask you another question?" 
"Sure," she answered. 
"You once told me that the thing that made you fall in love with him was 
that he made you feel so loved, as if he saw in you some quality that you 
didn't realize you had. When I saw him at the restaurant, I noticed that he 
was speaking to you in a very loving manner, and you were responding to him 
in kind. I wonder if you could tell me what the quality is that you felt 
that you didn't know you had?" 
"That's an interesting question," she said as she thought for a moment. 
"I think the only thing I can say is that you're different from him in that 
you look to me for validation, and he is happy when you agree with him. You 
see, the thing about him is that he always wants my approval, while I 
wouldn't care if he asked for it or not. It's not my place to approve or 
disapprove of him. He's a grown man, and I don't like the idea of policing 
him. Sometimes he needs my approval, and sometimes I want to give it to him. 
And I know that is the way that you feel about me, and he sometimes needs 
your approval and sometimes you want to give it to him. But there's a 
difference in the way we look for the approval. You know, it's not what you 
like or dislike about me that I can't stand. It's the fact that he will 
always look to me to tell him if he is okay or not. I think it's bad for a 
relationship, that type of dependence. I like to tell him when he is right 
and wrong, and sometimes I'm too hard on him, but that's the way I'm made. 
As a woman, I like to be needed, but I'm not a needy person. I want my 
partner to be needed sometimes, but I don't want to need him all the time." 
"Okay, that makes sense," I replied. "So in the future, if he needs your 
approval, he needs to come directly to you." 
"No, you're right," she replied. "I don't want him to need me. I can't 
stand the need. I would rather that he not need me and stand on his own." 
"So you're not going to take him back?" I asked. 
"I don't know," she answered. 
"Then what about your husband?" I asked. "What's going to happen to him?" 
"I don't know that either." 
"So you're in a catch-22," I replied. 
"Yeah," she answered. "We both want a divorce, but there is no way out of 
it." 
"Maybe you should reconsider that," I said. 
"And maybe you should reconsider how you choose to live your life," she 
answered, "because the person you're with is making you unhappy." 
I looked down at the ground and watched the tears falling from my eyes. 
This was just what I needed to pull me out of the funk I was in. 
Sometimes things come to us in an order that we have no choice about and we 
can't seem to stop them from occurring. It was now obvious to me that I had 
to do something about the situation with Jeff. I had been caught up in a 
love affair that was so deep and powerful that I couldn't let it go. But I 
wasn't sure how to make it go away. He was in the process of divorcing his 
wife, and I wasn't sure if I wanted a divorce from my husband. I wasn't sure 
if I wanted to be with Jeff. And I certainly wasn't sure if I could leave 
my husband for him. All I knew was that I wanted to see him again, but I 
didn't know if I could do anything about it. 
I woke the next morning to the sound of the phone ringing. Jeff had been 
wanting to talk to me ever since he got off the phone with me the night 
before. I didn't know how I was going to tell him that I was still 
considered the other woman, because I didn't want to be perceived as a 
home-wrecker, or any of the other women's wives had been a home-wrecker in 
their relationships. I didn't know if he was capable of being faithful to me 
if I were to allow him to be with me in my situation. I was going to have to 
explain all of that to him, and I just wasn't sure I was up to it. 
I walked over to the window to answer the phone, knowing that if Jeff was 
calling to apologize, I had some serious apologizing of my own to do. But 
when I picked up the phone, I didn't hear anything from him. I started to 
wonder if he really would call, and then I heard a sound coming through the 
walls that I knew all too well. His ring. 
"Hello," I answered. 
"Hello," he answered back. 
"What do you want?" I asked. 
"You didn't call me back last night," he answered. 
"No," I answered, "I wanted to talk to you, but I fell asleep." 
"You didn't come to bed?" he asked. 
"Well, not exactly." 
"What do you mean, 'not exactly'?" he asked. 
"Well, Jeff," I started, "I want to tell you what happened, but I'm not 
sure I want to go through that story again, so I'm going to tell you this." 
"Just come on over to my house," he said. "I have something I want to show 
you." 
"No," I replied. "I'm not going to do that. That would be an incredibly 
bad idea, and I won't allow you to take advantage of me by asking me to do 
something like that." 
"What?" he asked. 
"Well," I said, "I have never in my life wanted to do anything as much as I 
want to be with you right now, but it is hard for me to come to your house 
and not be intimate with you." 
"Can't you just get over the jealousy?" he asked. 
"Jeff," I said, "You're the one who has to be jealous." 
"I don't," he answered, "I love you." 
"Okay," I said, "I won't come over." 
"Well then how about if you come to the shop," he said. "I have some things 
that I want to show you." 
"What?" I asked. 
"Just come to the shop," he repeated. 
"All right," I answered. "But I want to know how you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:18
