Our story begins with a trip by train from Vancouver to New Westminster. The railway track crosses the Fraser River just downstream from the town of Steveston where a sizable white community makes its home. In September 2011, the New Westminster neighbourhood of Shaughnessy is enjoying the best real estate values in the world. Real Estate prices in the area are the best in the world. (According to CNBC in a report in 2011). In 2011, Canadian home prices are up 22% year-over-year, according to Royal LePage (2011). In Vancouver alone, prices have been soaring for five consecutive years. This chart depicts the number of homes in Vancouver selling over the asking price. The number of homes that sold for a loss in 2011 was 2.2% higher than those that sold for a loss in 2010. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, total household debt in the Greater Vancouver area reached $1.04 trillion in 2010. This total included mortgage debt, consumer credit and car loans. At the end of December 2011, the total value of homes on the market in Greater Vancouver was $17.6 billion, the lowest since the inception of the CMHC. The following chart from a Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation report provides an idea of how the total value of the market fluctuates in a given year. It shows the total value of the market divided by the population of the area. There has never been a time when there were more housing units available for sale at any given time, other than today. The low point was the first quarter of 2008, when a record low number of homes were for sale. Since that time, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of homes that have been sold. This is largely due to the large number of immigrants who moved to the area for work. But as we will see later, immigrants are one of the major drivers of prices.
