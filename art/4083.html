"This organization is definitely one of my favorites. I think a lot of the guys on the team, myself included, are guys that have a lot of room to grow and show a lot of people that we're willing to work hard. I'm looking forward to it. It's something I'm really looking forward to for the next season."

That's saying a lot coming from a native of New Jersey who won the Art Ross Trophy last season.

"I'm not a fan of the East. I'm not a big fan of all that. But the way the East is and how tight it is, it's going to be interesting," said Tomlinson, who scored 15 goals and had 32 points in the same number of games last season. "I'm not someone that likes the pressure. I'm more of a person that just comes out there and plays. I think I'm one of those type of guys that can step in at any time and contribute. I think I can help a team out in any way and do whatever they need from me."

It's been awhile since San Diego has had a legit power forward, a goal scorer and a guy that can put the puck in the net with the snap of his stick. He'll certainly be up against it and at the top of the depth chart for the team's forwards when the puck drops for the 2014-15 season.

So who is he?

"It's kind of hard for me to say what I think my role is going to be. I like to be honest and open and tell people what I'm going to be able to do," he said. "What I'm going to do is I'm going to try and help the team win. There's not a whole lot to say about that."

He's been around a lot of good people and learned some things from some of them.

"My teammates, that's for sure, they're like my second family and I've learned so much from all of them," Tomlinson said. "Even some of the guys that are not with the team anymore, guys like Brian Boucher, Pat Sibley. They've all taught me so much about hockey and the game in general. I've learned so much from them, just on how to get to the playoffs, how to be a good pro and how to be a leader on the team."

Last year he was the one leader on a team that didn't have a whole lot of leaders, a situation he didn't have any trouble adapting to.

"Last year I think it really helped me more to not be the guy that leads by example," he said. "I had no choice but to lead the team as a captain last year, and that was something that I don't really like to do. I think I grew a lot with that. I didn't have to be the guy on the team or the leader for the team. I think I learned from all of those guys that I worked with on the team that I was able to grow and I'm sure for this upcoming season there's going to be some big role for me as well as for this team."

On Monday, Tomlinson began the new season with high hopes and expectations, which he hopes can carry over into this season.

"It's been a long offseason, like everyone said, last year was so different for everybody and this year is different. I feel like it's a new season for me," he said. "Last year was big, being the captain. Obviously this year is even bigger because we're moving into a new arena and we want to be on top of the West. We don't want to be on top of the West again but it's very important for us to be there.

"Just kind of a new year and we've got new players. We've got some new free agents and just a new mindset and new attitude from all of us. We have a new head coach that's come in with a different system, so I think it's going to be exciting for everyone."

So it's not like the forward has a long to-do list heading into camp or training camp. He's ready for a fresh start.

"I think it's going to be more than it was last year. I really do," Tomlinson said. "Last year, I don't think there was a lot that happened. Just a little bit of talking and getting things down on paper, I think a lot of that stuff is already out of the way, and it's just the players, everyone is ready to go, get things started. Last year I felt like everything was new and everything was exciting. I think we'll have more than that this year."

What kind of coach and system does Tomlinson think he has in coach Todd Richards?

"I think he's very skilled in his way of teaching and very personable," Tomlinson said. "He knows his system inside and out. He doesn't have to teach too much. He's able to teach the system and make players into the players they're supposed to be, which is nice."

One of the players he'll be watching closely will be the guy who was the big "X-factor" last season and had a lot to do with his success.

"I like the young guy. He's a good player," Tomlinson said of Kevin Leclerc, the 26-year-old forward who is making the move from the AHL to San Diego after scoring four goals and seven points in nine games with the Admirals last season. "I saw him a lot at this year's training camp in Wilkes-Barre (PA) when I was back. I thought he played great, he played big and made a lot of plays out there.

"He's a guy that I've always admired. I kind of watched him growing up and he was in a league that wasn't too far away and watched him play a lot. I was one of the guys he was scoring goals against and we were big rivals. So it's great to have another great player to compete with and go against and compete with him. It's good for hockey."

Like many new additions to a team that made the playoffs last season, Tomlinson will be getting up to speed quickly with his new teammates and coaches.

"I think we're all in the same boat, a little bit of information is lost at first," he said. "But we can still get to the point where everybody understands everything, so I'm just looking forward to seeing where we are at and what we're going to do. We all have a lot of information to learn. I know some of the players I've played with before and there's going to be some new guys coming in so it's going to take a little while for us to get there."

The question remains, though, how well can Tomlinson adjust to new line mates? It's a question that will have to be answered pretty soon.

"It doesn't matter, it's going to be a new opportunity, like I said," he said. "That's something that will happen here and there. Obviously with the new coaching staff and all the changes going on, things are happening pretty fast right now and with the new players.

"They're going to be the ones that are out there, getting ready for the season, so they'll be the ones playing the most. But in between that, they'll play me a little bit and I'll play some with guys like Keaton (Maddox) and (Mason) Ming. It's really up to them how I'm used or how I'm not used. It's up to them what type of role I get on the team."

So if Tomlinson is ready</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:15
