The final track is the only song on the album that was not written by Tyler, the Creator. He is credited with writing the music to "Lone" by Jhene Aiko and Mike Posner.

Development
Tyler said, "[...] I’ve been wanting to make a record like this for a while, since 2007 when I was a freshman in high school [...] When I was writing my album in the fall of 2008, I wrote about 80% of the album I ended up releasing. Then when I started working on the new one in 2011, I only had about 20% finished. The first half of the album is about me as a younger guy, and now the second half of the album is basically me maturing."

Release and promotion
The track listing and album artwork for Flower Boy were revealed on Tyler's website on November 12, 2017. Three days later, he revealed that the release date would be February 23, 2018.

The first single from Flower Boy, "Boredom", was released on November 30, 2017, with a music video by Kahlil Joseph released in December 2017.

Critical reception

Flower Boy received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76, based on 26 reviews. The Independent called it "arguably one of the best albums of the decade." Exclaim! said the album was "overwhelming in its excellence."

In his review for the album, Joe Lynch of Rolling Stone wrote: "Flower Boy isn't just a more fully realized iteration of his musical ambitions, but a crucial moment in the long evolution of rap." Jon Caramanica of The New York Times praised the album, writing: "There are plenty of moments here that will be sampled or referenced, with some success, by rappers across multiple generations. You’re also likely to hear these songs in concert, which means Mr. Tyler’s greatest and most surprising success here is how well he has captured the energy of live performance. "
