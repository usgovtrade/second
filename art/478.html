the simple,  but fundamental, truth that the only solution is a comprehensive
partnership.

?Enron,s partnership vision was created to drive productivity. We will look 
beyond our company,s immediate needs to create global solutions. We will 
collaborate with others to maximize financial and physical returns in 
everything we do.  We will strive to strengthen other organizations through 
outstanding relationships, improve internal processes, truly listen, and 
learn. These will be our driving forces.

We will respect all viewpoints and recognize that there are many paths to 
success.  We will not allow organizational barriers or working environment 
complications to interfere with achieving our objectives. We will eliminate 
+analysis paralysis, by objectively evaluating all options on the table, and 
we will not be afraid to make our choices.  We will offer creative and 
innovative solutions.

We will approach the enormous tasks ahead of us boldly, yet realistically.  
We will ask God,s blessing on our efforts. We will embrace change that will 
allow all of us to better serve the many interests of Enron. We will work 
hard. We will need to work together.

It is time to move forward. Let,s join together around the bold goals we 
have achieved, and with a strong sense of where we are going. Let,s share 
the responsibility of continuing to make Enron the great company it can and 
should be.

Thank you.
