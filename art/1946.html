"You can't stop them in the middle, so you have to wait," said Broad, as his side went 2-1 up on their hosts, who had a point at stumps. "Whether they keep batting or not, they have had their day. I just think you can't really keep looking at the scoreboard after each over."

West Indies were given a reminder about their batting frailties when Chris Woakes punished SIX from a full ball to take England to 54 without loss at tea.

With the second innings still in progress, Broad was again a threat with the ball, bowling an unplayable delivery to be caught behind by Ojha. But West Indies survived in the end, with skipper Darren Sammy taking India into the lead when he found the boundary with a back-foot punch to the leg side.

The tourists continued to battle on, with Sammy putting on 84 for the seventh wicket with Deonarine, who took 36 from 23 balls with his sweep and a reverse sweep before he was run out in a run-out act from the non-striker's end.

Sammy was last man out as West Indies lost their first wicket just three balls later, with Samit Patel striking for the final time in a six-wicket defeat.

"It was a fantastic effort from the boys to get us in the position we were in," Broad said.

"The batting last night was incredible, and that really pushed us on," he added. "Once we were there, we needed to keep it together for a long time. But it was always going to be difficult.

"You can tell from the way the boys went about it in the field that it's been a long year," he added. "But at least we have a game, and now we get to celebrate. It's a nice little cherry on the cake, for sure."
