A few weeks ago, Cindy Dugan, the vice president for University Operations who is retiring in March, sent a message to the NM State community to thank everyone for helping her get through her difficult, but triumphant, retirement.

The NM State Student Association board of directors passed a resolution last night to encourage graduate students to apply for a one-year graduate student visa to work in the U.S. after graduation. Last night's board meeting was held at the university's newly renovated student union building, which has been dubbed the "J-Center."

It's a great pleasure and an honor to be here with you this morning. I would like to extend my warmest welcome to each and every one of you to Cougar Country, and welcome you to State University. It's a great honor to be here, and I just want to be as up-front as I can. This is the first time that the NM State community will be hearing directly from me.

With this being my first official visit to the great State of NM, I wanted to take some time to meet some of the hard working, dedicated students at this state university. So, the other day I met with a few students, some from the university, and some non-university students who plan on attending NM State.

I just want to welcome everybody. As some of you may know, this is my first official visit, or formal appearance at this university. I have had a chance to meet with many of the students who have been supportive in the past, and I also received an opportunity to visit with some of the faculty, some of our faculty and staff, and some of our current students.

The Cougar Country Network is a website that features the best of the NM State Athletics program and serves as a way to enhance student experiences.

Cougar Country Network (CCN) is NM State's digital platform for athletics news, game previews, highlights, photos, and fan-favorite videos. It is a way to enhance student experiences through the content and culture of athletics.

There is a strong tradition of athletics at NM State University. Over the years, thousands of student-athletes have led NM State teams to numerous conference and national championships in all five of the NCAA's Division I athletic programs.

A lot of sports coverage has become dominated by TV and radio. It’s nice to have the option to check on events live from an in-person perspective.

If you’re an avid college athletics fan, one of the most exciting times for you is the week before the national college football championship tournament. That’s why I wanted to talk about how you can take full advantage of your time at the Sanford Pentagon by using the official NM State app.

There is a reason some people like their teams so much. And this year, there’s no reason to be ashamed of saying you’re a fan of the New Mexico State University Aggies. The Aggies started off the 2016-17 season winning seven straight games and finishing last season with an 11-2 record.

The NM State Cougars took to the court Tuesday night in hopes of extending their season for another year, and they did just that. The Cougars defeated the Eastern New Mexico Greyhounds 58-53, and extended their winning streak to six games.

The NM State Football program is on the rise, which is a fact not lost on the Aggies’ student-athletes. The football team hosted a clinic in mid-October at NM State, in an effort to show support for the Special Olympics of New Mexico.
