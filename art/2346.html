This was actually a fun game to play, though I can see why it's been abandoned.

The idea of the game is that a team of 4 astronauts on EVAs (exploring a near-Earth asteroid) must fight off an asteroid base that is attacking them by sabotaging their EVAs.

This was a cool twist to the normal scenario. It was too bad that most of the maps were completely different, or I would have been able to play the same map multiple times.

I really think that this game has great potential. I'll definitely be buying the expansion pack!

Weird, my laptop's fan made some weird noise and the game quit for a moment. Anyway, this is a good little roguelike game. I can't believe I'm having to use my fingers to type because I'm so amazed that I got this one to work with a computer I got in 2005 (Dell Optiplex GX1) before I ever heard of a mouse or keyboard. I even managed to find a computer game my family bought for my 3 year old, so she can spend the time I take on a game playing while I look for parts.

This game is very basic, but this is the kind of game that's not fun unless you're good at it.

There were a few games like this, that had me stumped on how to beat them until I figured out something to push around and use. I could always get something in the air, land it on something, then fly it off again, but otherwise it was a lost cause.

The first time I ran this game I was totally freaking out. My avatar flew off the map and could not be retrieved. I had to start over again, but at least now it's running fine.

This game does have flaws. I played the tutorial and the second time I got a popup asking me if I wanted to create an avatar. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to create one for this game. Anyway, the next time I started the game I got a "Game doesn't exist" when I tried to continue the tutorial. Eventually I found a save point and was able to continue without a problem.

I know this sounds kind of crazy, but that's kind of the point. The game itself is actually a lot of fun, I didn't know you were supposed to use your avatar to defeat this, I assumed there were special rules.

I started over because it's easier to do so than to figure out how to continue my own game. The demo was great though.

In one word, No! No you can't even use them!
