the desire to see a single, streamlined solution that provides a truly 
comprehensive trading environment.  The new version of the Global 
Environment for Trading is the logical next step.  The combined changes, 
along with the revised merit order ranking system will mean greater 
interaction and transactional transparency for Enron,s trading partners.

The new GLOBALTRADEMARKET_DOMAIN feature will allow marketers to register 
their domains in the new system.  Once Enron has approved the submitted 
domains, this feature will allow users to click on a trademark and use this 
to enter a website for a company that has registered a trademark in the 
domain name.

We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding further 
improvements to the system.  As we have finalized this new version, we will 
transition to the new environment in stages.  In the first stage, we will 
reach out to the new users with a direct mail package to introduce them to 
the new GlobalTradeMap website and ask them to provide feedback on the 
website.

If you have any questions concerning this new version of GlobalTradeMap, 
please contact Mike Burke at 3-6847.

Best Regards,
Michael Burke for Gene Lockhart ) Director 

NOTE: We are committed to keeping GlobalTradeMap a valuable and viable 
resource to the Houston community. If you have any comments or suggestions 
on how to improve this site, please send them to: globaltrademarketing@enron.com

Thanks for your patience and understanding while we have transitioned to 
the new GLOBALTRADEMARKET_DOMAIN.

Thanks,
