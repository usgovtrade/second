This question from one of our readers led to a lengthy discussion on how many types of heart rate monitors fail and how you can solve them, even if it means you have to pay more.

Here's a quick primer:

Heart rate monitors are electronic devices that track your heart rate from the beats per minute (bpm) in the area of ​​the chest. There are several popular models such as Polar, Garmin and Under Armour.

Most models have certain limitations and drawbacks:

Polar has several common complaints such as problems in the chest sensor, which can lead to improper functioning or complete failure.

Garmin has received high marks for simplicity and ease of use. It also has one of the most accurate heart rate monitors on the market. It is available in several models and packages.

Under Armour has three products. Unfortunately, it uses chest straps that are not compatible with a treadmill, it has numerous reports of failing to charge the device.

The common denominator in all complaints is incorrect reading of heart rate, leading to the failure of a proper workout. The main causes of failure are incorrect placement of the sensor, which can lead to incorrect reading. There are many other reasons and we'll cover them in detail.

How to Check Your Heart Rate with Fitness Trackers

There are several ways to check heart rate, ranging from very simple to complex. Most of them require that you do some effort and exercise.

Check Heart Rate with a Stopwatch and Pulsewatch

This method is simple. All you need is a stopwatch, a pulse watch and a stopwatch alarm. If you already use this tool as part of your workout routine, you already have everything you need. We'll just walk you through the procedure.

Step 1: Check your heart rate every time you change your activity level. For example, if you walk, run or jump, do this.

Step 2: Set up your stopwatch. Use a pulse watch to record your pulse once every 30 seconds and stopwatch. Now start your activity.

Step 3: Start recording with the pulse watch, wait for a minute and take a pulse with your wrist. Check the pulse rate on the stopwatch as you continue with the workout.

Step 4: At the end of the activity, record the heart rate again for a couple minutes to average out the last reading.

If you have this method of measurement, all you need to do is to keep track of your heart rate for any activity. This is especially useful if you are in for a hike or ride a bike.

Now let's get down to the details, check out what causes different types of heart rate monitoring failings.

First, let's see how to deal with each of the major heart rate monitor errors:

Polar Vantage HR Error: 1 of 5 Common Ways to Correct Failures

The Polars often have multiple issues. In this case, it was the faulty chest sensor, which caused the device to record incorrect data. Other issues are common to all devices. It should also be noted that you should be checking your pulse regularly to ensure that the sensor does not get dirty.

To fix this issue, you need to remove the sensor, clean it with soap and water and reattach it. You should not be using any kind of alcohol because it may cause malfunction. There is a chance that there will be a slight delay in the data, but you should solve the problem to avoid additional issues.

There are other reasons why you may have a reduced heart rate reading:

If you have a high heart rate that will be above 220 beats per minute, the rate is likely to be affected by this problem. You can use another wristband to check your pulse.

Even if you have a very high heart rate, it may be because you are out of shape. The heart needs to work harder and if you do not have a good strength and stamina, it will become too busy, leading to less efficient performance and fewer results.

In this case, you need to find a workout routine that is more balanced and will promote a better workout.

I'm currently on vacation in Mexico and this morning I had a great workout in 40 degrees air temperature. For me it was like I was in 60-70 degrees air temperature in the middle of winter. I have to admit that I forgot the jacket for many times when I was doing pushups and crunches. I had to make some corrections with the temperature control unit because it was not even working. After having the temperature control unit repaired, it began to get cold, but with the heart rate monitor and pulse watch I could adjust the temperature to my liking. I hope you get this kind of results.

GPS and Heart Rate Problem - Polar Vantage Pro

The Garmin Vantage devices are very popular, but it is not well known that they are quite sensitive. Nowadays, most people use GPS smartwatches, but they are also susceptible to these problems. If you have one of these, be very careful where you put it. You can also see how to adjust the heart rate monitor when it fails.

I have one of the best heart rate monitors in the market but I get trouble time after time with it. It works fine for a few hours and when I start my walk in the morning, I begin to feel pain in my upper chest. It is just my guess that when I was walking, the monitor got so hot it got too close to my skin. I had to take the device off and now I hope to fix the problem.

No Data on Garmin Vantage Heart Rate Monitor

Garmin has two main types of monitors that need to be checked:

The Heart Rate monitor:

If you go to the Garmin website, it says, "There's no reason to check your heart rate. The Garmin Connect feature on your compatible Garmin devices allows you to check your heart rate directly from your watch. This is a great way to measure your workout intensity, especially for higher-intensity workouts or running/cycling outdoors. You can check your heart rate at any time during your activity by pressing the start/stop button, and you'll get an instantaneous reading that's as accurate as a blood-pressure measurement."

The GPS:

Again, from the website, "While you're moving, you can use the GPS-enabled features on your device to help record your daily activity, such as time, distance, and speed, as well as the route you took for easier navigation."

If you don't feel any pain, I suggest that you check the Garmin device to see whether the battery needs to be replaced. I think that this is the most likely reason why the device has been damaged. You can buy a new battery if that's the case and then charge it overnight. It should work the next day.

Garmin Forerunner 220 Watch Stopped Working

Now let's look at another kind of issue, when the monitor is not working properly and you are forced to stop using it. As a general rule, Garmin is very good and you can expect a long life. I feel that sometimes when the Garmin is not working properly, this happens due to the user and not because the device is defective. Here are some things to remember:

Garmin devices use lithium batteries, which provide longer life. If you have been in areas where the weather was bad and your device got wet, it may not work properly and you may not see the battery icon or may only see a partial power.

We recommend that you keep these devices clean at all times. If the device is wet or dirty and left to dry, your battery will die. If you do not keep it dry, you can get a bad display.

There are numerous options for Garmin device repairs, including Garmin or Garmin stores. Sometimes all you need to do is to put it under the sun to dry and it will work fine. If you have a Garmin model that seems faulty or if you see any other errors, be sure to contact Garmin to receive a complete diagnosis</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:34:34
