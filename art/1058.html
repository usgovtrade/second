The only conclusion that can be drawn from this instruction is that Medicare Advantage is the only plan qualified to be Medicare Part C plan and is also “designated to be Medicare Part C plan”. It is interesting to note that CMS created this additional language to help Medicare recipients understand what plans are not “Medicare Part C plans” and it is specifically written to avoid conflicts with federal law and to avoid confusion.

Medicare Part C and Private Coverage

At the present time, it is not a requirement for an HMO to be licensed to enroll Medicare beneficiaries. Some HMOs may advertise that they are Medicare approved or Medicare certified. In actuality, no law or regulation exists requiring an HMO to be licensed to enroll Medicare beneficiaries. The reason this is important is that HMOs are required to comply with Federal and State laws which are very different from each other. Moreover, some private health insurers that are willing to cover their Medicare subscribers are in violation of State laws by providing coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, HMOs offering “Medicare Part C coverage” are not Medicare approved, Medicare certified or Medicare approved by Medicare. Likewise, Medicare-approved and Medicare-certified HMOs and insurance companies are not Medicare approved, Medicare certified or Medicare approved by Medicare.

Medicare Advantage Plans and Other Medicare HMOs and Private Plans

Some Medicare Advantage plans do not have a capitated plan; they do have a risk-based premium. Likewise, Medicare Advantage plans are not required to have a contracted primary care physician for enrollees. Moreover, “the contracts between Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans do not require (Medicare Advantage plans) to be located in a given geographic region.” This allows Medicare Advantage plans to contract with Medicare-certified and Medicare-approved HMOs and insurance companies to enroll Medicare beneficiaries and provide for the provision of Medicare Part C and private coverage. The Medicare Advantage plan contracts with the Medicare-approved or Medicare-certified HMO or insurance company to provide the service and pay the Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D coinsurance. The Medicare Advantage plan will then bill Medicare for the medical service, the coinsurance for Medicare Part B and the coinsurance for Medicare Part D. Medicare does not provide payment to the Medicare Advantage plan for this service. Instead, Medicare will pay the Medicare Advantage plan for the covered medical service. Likewise, Medicare Advantage plans are not required to provide a deductible to enrollees. However, the Medicare Advantage plan contracts with the Medicare approved or Medicare-certified HMO or insurance company to pay the Medicare Part B deductible. The Medicare Advantage plan will pay Medicare Part B, including the Medicare Part B deductible.

Enrollment in Medicare Part C Plans and Medicare Advantage Plans

In order to be eligible for enrollment, you must be 65 years of age and enrolled in Medicare. Medicare Part C coverage is one of the types of Medicare Advantage plans available. Therefore, anyone 65 years of age or older is eligible for Medicare Part C. In some cases, Medicare Part C benefits are also available to individuals with disabilities. It is important to note that some HMOs are Medicare approved and Medicare approved by Medicare that may not be considered “Medicare Advantage Plans.” It is very important to understand that no law or regulation exists to require an HMO to have a Medicare approved or Medicare approved by Medicare. It is only important to determine if the plan is a Medicare-approved or Medicare-certified HMO or insurance company.

In summary, Medicare Advantage Plans are an excellent option for most Medicare beneficiaries because you can still retain your current physician, you can keep your current plan of care, you have a variety of plan options, the cost of Medicare Advantage Plans is less than Original Medicare, the cost of Medicare Advantage Plans are competitive with other healthcare plans, your Medicare Advantage Plan is portable and you can change from one Medicare Advantage Plan to another.
