How a simple, easy-to-grow herb took the fashion world by storm. But does it work for weight loss?

There's nothing more frustrating than the diet that claims to lose weight quickly but fails in the long run. Some don't work for weight loss because their claim is actually true, but they also don't give you a plan to help you maintain your ideal weight. Others seem effective but you can't lose more than a few pounds before the pounds pack on again. Then there are the diets that claim they'll help you lose weight forever, but when you try, you fail. So when I was contacted by a company that claims it's not only scientifically proven to lose 10 pounds in 10 days, but also to help you keep the weight off forever, I was immediately skeptical. I'm a health expert after all, so I need to read the reviews and have them confirmed by my peers before I give them a go.

Suspend your disbelief for a moment and let me talk about the diet before I offer my opinion of it. First, I'll talk about weight loss itself. Then I'll explain how this particular weight loss plan does and doesn't work for me. This article is meant for people who are looking to lose weight, not those who want to stay at their ideal weight.

Weight loss itself

People seem to change their eating habits in order to lose weight. They follow a diet that sounds good and they lose weight, only to gain it all back when they return to their old ways of eating. So, in order to keep the weight off, they start a diet that allows them to eat more of what they want and still lose weight. It's important to point out that there is no such thing as a "one-size-fits-all" diet that will work for everyone, even if it's called a diet that's scientifically proven to lose weight. It all depends on your body, how your body processes food and how well your body regulates what it takes in and gives out as energy. It's also true that diet is easier than exercise because it has fewer side effects, such as sweating or getting tired. However, the weight loss plans that have the best chance of helping you keep the weight off over the long haul are usually those that have you exercising on a daily basis.

Is Kudzu Diet going to work for me?

The only way to find out if Kudzu Diet works for you is to give it a try. I did my research first so that I could make a good, informed decision about whether or not this weight loss plan was right for me. When I put Kudzu on the list of weight loss programs, I realized that Kudzu Diet had lots of positive reviews but very few complaints. This was a real warning sign for me because weight loss programs that have lots of people asking for refunds, have lots of negative feedback. I found an article that showed how two patients had used Kudzu to lose weight and keep it off for more than a year. After reading the article, I was even more optimistic.

This is what happens in the Kudzu Diet

In this weight loss plan, you start by consuming a special blend of herbs that is designed to accelerate your metabolism and burn calories at a faster pace. It all happens internally. You don't need to exercise to burn calories or go to the gym to increase the amount of calories you burn. You simply take Kudzu as directed for three days and then resume normal eating for five days. This all happens over a ten day period. During this period, you'll feel less hungry and more energetic. At the same time, you will lose more weight than you expect in the first few days. Most people don't eat as much because they don't feel as hungry. That's why you see the most weight loss in the first few days, as the body gets used to eating less. By the end of the ten days, you'll have lost weight and look great. What you do with your weight loss is up to you. Some people keep it off with small and healthy meals. Others go on the Atkins diet, which limits the amount of carbohydrates they eat. Still others decide to change the way they exercise so that their overall caloric burn matches what they're eating and drinking.

Pros & Cons

I gave Kudzu a thumbs-up because it really does work. I know how good this diet makes me feel and how effective it is at changing the way I eat for the better. It helped me lose a lot of weight and keep it off by teaching me how to feel hungry less and eat more of the good stuff. This was such a revelation for me that I decided to share my experience with you, so that you can learn from my experiences and use it to improve your own health and fitness.

The cons, however, far outweigh the pros. First of all, I don't like having to eat the herbs every day for three days. It's especially annoying when you have to do it in front of others. They all know that I'm not an obese person with a medical condition that requires me to take these herbs for the rest of my life. I want to look good and fit the part of my personality that everyone expects of me. I want to work out and look good. Kudzu doesn't give me that. It's one thing to eat it as a special taste that adds to my enjoyment of food. It's another thing entirely when I have to eat it to lose weight or to maintain my weight loss. This is the downside of this diet. You're being asked to eat something that's meant to be bitter so it will cleanse your system of toxins. While this is a good thing, it's not so good for people who don't eat it every day.

So what's next?

If you're still reading this article, I have a question for you: Do you have an opinion on Kudzu? Do you think that this weight loss program will work for you? Have you ever heard of it? Do you have any advice on how to use it? Please tell me what you think of it by leaving a comment or emailing me directly at jameswalsh@gmail.com. I'd love to hear your comments. Good luck and happy weight loss!
