An example of the semiconductor device is a probe card having a plurality of wiring layers. In a typical probe card, as described in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2001-34449, a plurality of wiring layers are stacked on a substrate, and terminal pins connected to the wiring layers are embedded in a resin (a sealing resin) so as to be exposed at the bottom of the resin. By embedding the terminal pins in the resin, water resistance of the terminal pins is ensured. A space defined by the resin and the terminal pins is called an interior of the probe card.
A test method of semiconductor devices includes, for example, a functional test. In this functional test, testing is performed by bringing electrodes provided on a probe card into contact with electrodes (pads) provided on a semiconductor device. The wiring layers of the probe card are connected to measurement equipment for measuring voltages of the electrodes to be measured by applying voltages to the wiring layers. The voltage applied to each wiring layer is applied to each electrode, which makes the semiconductor device output a signal. The voltage outputted from the semiconductor device in response to the input voltage is measured by the measurement equipment to evaluate an operation of the semiconductor device.
However, the test for a semiconductor device such as a microprocessor may be performed using a test terminal, which is used only for testing, instead of bringing the electrodes provided on the probe card into contact with the electrodes provided on the semiconductor device. When the semiconductor device is tested using the test terminal, there are cases where some of the wiring layers provided in the interior of the probe card are made to function as measurement paths of the test terminal in order to measure a test signal outputted from the test terminal.
On the other hand, the structure of the probe card has been changing in order to reduce the size and cost. In a typical probe card, the interior of the probe card is formed only by the sealing resin. In a recent probe card, for example, a resin (a base plate) having through holes is attached to an end surface of a wiring substrate, in which the wiring layers are formed, so as to secure the rigidity of the probe card. Accordingly, the structure of the probe card may be formed of different materials in different layers.
Under these circumstances, when testing the semiconductor device by using the test terminal in the interior of the probe card, it is necessary to provide contact between the test terminal and each of the wiring layers. Since there is a gap of approximately several microns to several tens of microns between the wiring layers, it is difficult to guarantee stable contact.
Furthermore, even when the wiring layers provided in the interior of the probe card and the test terminal are connected to each other by micro solder, it is difficult to assure stable contact for each of the wiring layers due to displacement of the position of each wiring layer caused by the change in the ambient temperature. If a stable contact is not assured, there is a possibility that it will be difficult to transmit a test signal. Furthermore, this may cause an electrical short circuit or the like. Therefore, it is difficult to assure stable contact between the wiring layers and the test terminal in the interior of the probe card.
As described above, in the probe card having a plurality of wiring layers, a stable contact state is difficult to assure between the test terminal and the wiring layers in the interior of the probe card, because of the gap between the wiring layers, displacement of the position of the wiring layers due to temperature change, and a high possibility of generating micro solder.
When there is an electrical short circuit in the wiring layers in the interior of the probe card and the semiconductor device is tested by using the test terminal, the semiconductor device operates to output a signal and generate an electrical signal at a point where the electrical short circuit is formed. Therefore, a measurement result obtained by performing test for the semiconductor device includes a noise (e.g., a low-frequency noise) generated by the semiconductor device itself. The size of the influence of such a noise depends on various factors including the ambient temperature of the probe card. Therefore, when performing test for a semiconductor device at different temperatures, there is a large possibility</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:15
