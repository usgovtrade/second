“The agency uses this data to investigate all cases of fraud and abuse, regardless of whether the item at issue was reported stolen,” the agency said. “The process does not deny a person the ability to report an item as stolen, nor does it force them to choose between filing a property loss report and enrollment in SORP. In fact, the process is designed to provide a person with the opportunity to learn more about their rights under the SORP and pursue a solution that is right for them.”

The agency said that the program in many ways mirrors other efforts to combat fraud.

A 2015 Senate report by Sen. Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat, found that in many cases drug cartels and others have obtained real property through fraudulent means, and that many Americans were left without property.

“These cases often start with stolen identities, fake names or fraudulent documents, making it nearly impossible for law enforcement to identify victims of identity theft, and oftentimes making it difficult for homeowners to know who to call when they are trying to get their homes back,” the agency said.
