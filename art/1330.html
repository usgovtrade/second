The problem with this particular game is the lack of a story or reason to follow this game's narrative.

Yes, some characters are interesting but that's what the voice acting is for. There is no need for it to be voiced in the language the character speaks in. In fact, that does nothing but add another layer of complexity. A lot of the gameplay consists of finding clues by looking at the dialogue, so having them voiced can make it very hard to progress. To me, this takes away the mystery of these games. In that aspect, it kind of feels like watching a show with the dialogue on. It seems a lot more difficult to play than it is to watch.

I do have to say though, despite my problems with the voices, I really did like the story. The way it is told is that a couple of spies meet up one day. As they all have some kind of hobby or interest, they decide to put on an art exhibition in which every piece is a mystery. Then, after this exhibition, all four of them get killed by their nemesis and their bodies get stuffed into garbage bags. And you have to find the reason behind all of this. Well done, Ubisoft, I really do applaud you for making that plot. But, again, there is no need for this story to be played out using voices. This sort of game doesn't need that type of presentation.

I think a large part of the reason why Assassin's Creed had so many fans is that it actually made sense. You can do more than just walk around and collect information, you can actually interact with people and find clues. Unfortunately, in order to do that, you need to have a story. A game like this really only works as long as there is a reason to follow it. And even though Assassin's Creed had a story that worked, it really only got people interested if it already had a big following.

Another problem I have with this game is how boring the environment can be. The gameplay focuses on you walking around town trying to find clues. And although that can work as an effective way of making a game, it still requires you to be constantly moving. With the number of times I just stood still, I would have really preferred a setting that had a more static camera. Then again, the camera in Assassin's Creed was horrible. If they had the same camera in this game, then I'd have no problems with how this game is played. However, it just really gets annoying because you stand still and the camera moves. I'm talking here about the walking animation. This is the same movement you do when you try to move around something like a bush. In this game, however, when you do that, the camera moves. It isn't very pleasant to watch. At least that's why I chose to stand still. It's like if you tried to move from one spot to another, the camera would also move.

In conclusion, the environments are the downfall of Assassin's Creed II. The only thing that has survived the transition from one generation to the next is the engine. Well, the game engine, that is. And to me, this game's engine is one of the best that I've seen in a while. But, it's almost not there. It's just kind of there. Like, if you were to put another game engine in Assassin's Creed II, I don't think you'd notice the difference. Or at least, I wouldn't have.

And that is it for my full review of Assassin's Creed 2. I hope you enjoyed it. If you did, then please consider subscribing to my blog. And as always, I hope you found my video review entertaining. And lastly, don't forget to check out all of our gaming reviews by clicking here.

Hey there. I just wanted to stop by and say that I found your review to be very well written and entertaining to watch. It was very interesting to see how you viewed the story and the things that you took out of it. Overall, I really enjoyed the video and will be viewing your reviews more often! :D

I agree with you on the voices. You can mute them if you want to just watch the story. I don't think I could ever take this game serious because of all the voices in the game, I think it would be hard to have a clear conversation with somebody. Especially when they ask you questions about what was said, would you even know what to say? I think your video was a good representation of this game, I haven't played it but after watching your video I'm willing to play it.

Very well done review. I watched the video twice already, and am now very interested to play this game. Great reviews. :)

What really surprised me with this game was the depth of it. From the moment you start playing Assassin's Creed 2, you see this massive city with a map that can literally be compared to the real life world of London and you don't really see any limitations. Sure, there is the storyline with all the little hints, but really, the game is extremely open and with a huge variety of ways to approach it and solve it. I can't wait to start playing.

I have a different opinion of the game as you have the Assassin's Creed. For me, it was boring. I did like the setting and I liked the art work, but overall I wasn't pleased with Assassin's Creed II. The only plus side of the game that I liked was the characters and their personalities. I think the voice work was okay, but I would have loved to not have to listen to all of the voicing all of the time. Overall, I would have preferred a story line that would have to be completed in the game.

I think you have to have a story in a video game. If it was just walking around with little to do. No I think it should be like that. For one, its good for the gamers and the people playing. It can increase the game play time because you spend time on it. Another point that i wanted to make was that people can actually want to try to solve the mystery. Or maybe your not supposed to solve the mystery for that matter, but it is something that can make you play longer than just the walking and looking for clues. And i dont think the game is boring at all. It has great visuals that are attractive to gamers.

I was very happy to come across your review of this game. I watched the video and actually got really interested in the game. The voice over just took it away for me though. I've heard many great things about the story in the game but it just doesn't really seem to have a point.

I feel like the voice acting in the game was very unnecessary. A game with many "clues" and "hints" shouldn't have to have voiced dialogue either. I think that the voice acting would have made it harder for me to play the game, and I'm sure it would have confused a lot of people who didn't know what was going on.

I agree with you, the voice acting was pointless. What really surprised me about this game was how much of a waste of time it was. What I mean by that is that when you are in a game for hours, don't you want something to be happening? A lot of my friends say it's their favorite game, but I personally think it's a waste of time.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:47
