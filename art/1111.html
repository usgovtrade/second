In the next step we will move on to the front of our engine to see how we can connect our new exhaust.
There are some basic questions you need to ask yourself when designing a chassis. I have listed the ones that I have asked myself when building and testing my own trucks
I want to drive at a maximum of 65 km/h
I want to move on my rear wheels first
I want to have 2 axles, that are able to turn
I will use a differential for drive to my front wheels, and in addition to each other.
As mentioned earlier, I will use a differential for drive, however it can be made without one, as my friend Vito has done. A simple way of getting around this is by using only one axle and then giving it an electrical (and mechanical) actuated steering system. This would give it an ability to turn in all three dimensions. However, by giving a differential, this problem becomes null and void and also gives you a larger turning radius.
However, it is possible to move in all three dimensions, just by keeping the wheels straight in the center, and this is an example of having only 1 axle. For example:
Another option could be to use several small motors that turn in all three dimensions and are connected in such a way that one wheel drives the car forwards (2-wheel drive) and the other turns against it (4-wheel drive). Although, this might seem like overkill, it is also an option.
This is the layout of my current truck. I will tell you where everything goes in the next post.
There are 3 major pieces that go into any vehicle when you are getting ready to test drive it:
1. Body – This is how the car looks externally and also provides protection for us inside the vehicle if there were to be an accident or the car got in a tough spot.
3. Motor – this power plant helps us take off (</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:28
