Rachel

Oh God!

Jenny

I don't care. You'd better not mess up my 
life too, you little whore.

Jenny goes out. Rachel stands at the kitchen door. 
She calls down.

Rachel

Are you alright?

Rachel goes into the room with the crib. She lies down, 
still clothed,
on the top of the crib.

Rachel

Mummy!

And falls asleep. 

Jenny comes out of the basement.

Jenny

You've been very bad.

Jenny looks over towards Rachel's bedroom and goes into it.
She stands at the door.

Jenny

Are you alright?

Rachel turns over.

Jenny

Rachel?

Rachel

Mummy?

Jenny

Rachel.

Rachel gets up, slowly and painfully.

Rachel

What are you doing?

Jenny

Just looking at your cot.

Rachel

What's the matter?

Rachel

I want to play something.

Jenny

You want to play something? What?

Rachel

I want to play with my crayons.

Jenny

Are you sure?

Rachel

I want to play with my dolls.

Jenny

You can't play with your dolls now, sweetie.

Rachel

Oh, Mummy.

Jenny

Let's put them away now.

Rachel

Mummy, it's very cold.

Jenny

We can put your dolls away when you've done what 
you've to do.
Now go get a towel to wrap them in.

Rachel

Alright.

Rachel leaves.

Jenny

It's been difficult for me.

Jenny goes to the crib.

Jenny

You've been very bad.

Jenny picks up the dolls.

Jenny

You mustn't cry.

Jenny carries the dolls upstairs.

Rachel comes back down with the towel and the crayons.

Rachel

I put my crayons in the towel.

Jenny opens the cupboard.

Jenny

Right. Let's wrap up the dolls.

Rachel takes the crayons out.

Rachel

I'm ready.

Jenny opens the door of the cupboard.

Jenny

I've done it before. But I just can't remember 
how.

She looks at Rachel.

Jenny

I'm not sure, but you're just like your mother.

Rachel stares at Jenny.

Jenny

I don't like you.

Jenny looks down.

Rachel

You've killed the girl who used to be 
your mother.

Jenny stands up and stares at Rachel.

Jenny

You're the daughter of the child murderer.

Jenny leaves the room.

Jenny

You've been very bad.

She leaves.

Rachel closes the door.

Jenny comes back down.

Jenny

I feel as if I've slept for ages.

Jenny goes to the sink and runs water in it.

Rachel

What do you want me to do?

Jenny

I'm going to run a bath.

Jenny is soaping herself.

Rachel

I'm going to make you wash me, and then I'll get in 
the bath with you.

Jenny stops soaping herself and looks at Rachel.

Rachel

I'm going to wash your hair.

Jenny soaps Rachel's hair.

Rachel

Are you going to wash my body?

Jenny stops soaping and stops scrubbing Rachel's 
hair.

Jenny

Oh God. That's enough. I'm sorry.

Jenny goes over and turns on the taps for the bath.
She goes to the hall to the stairs and calls down.

Jenny

Just you go and play, darling.

Rachel gets up from the crib.

Rachel

Come and play with me, Mummy.

Jenny picks up Rachel's clothes.

Jenny

Okay, sweetie.

Rachel puts the towel around her waist.

Jenny

Would you like me to go and sit on the bed?

Rachel

No.

Rachel

Mummy's gone to go and be in the bath, darling.

Jenny

I don't want to be in the bath alone.

Rachel

Well I do.

Jenny puts on her clothes and goes upstairs.

Rachel turns off the light and closes the door. She 
lies back on the crib.

Rachel

I want a new crib.

She lies there.

When Rachel moves down the screen, Rachel and Jenny 
are in bed together. Rachel is lying with her 
head over the edge of the bed, her face down.
Jenny is standing naked at the end of the bed, 
squatting and staring into the light.

Rachel stirs and comes round. She looks up at Jenny.

Rachel

I don't like it when you cry.

Jenny

What?

Rachel

I'm very scared.

Jenny

Why?

Rachel

I'm going to die.

Jenny

You don't have to. We can get you help.

Rachel

What help?

Jenny looks down.

Rachel

Your husband can't love you. He wants to kill me.

Jenny

It was an accident.

Rachel

I'm going to die.

Jenny

You're not going to die.

Rachel

You'll never be happy.

Jenny

What?

Rachel

You'll never be happy because I'm going to die.

Jenny turns to Rachel.

Rachel

You can do whatever you like.

Jenny turns away.

Rachel

What did you say?

Jenny

I was having a dream.

Rachel

What did you say?

Jenny

I was having a nightmare. I was dreaming.

Rachel

I hate you.

Jenny

I'll sit in the chair and do the cribs for you now.

Rachel

I hate you.

Jenny

I'll stay here and do the cribs. It's not fair.

Rachel

I'm going to drown you.

Jenny turns around.

Jenny

You're not going to drown anybody.

Rachel

You've made me very unhappy.

Jenny looks at Rachel.

Jenny

You won't die.

Rachel

I want to die.

Jenny

That's alright.

Jenny comes back to the bed and stands by it.

Jenny

I want to cuddle with you.

Rachel

No.

Jenny

Please. I want to hold you.

Rachel

No.

Rachel turns away.

Jenny

Please.

Rachel turns to Jenny.

Jenny

Cuddle with you?

Rachel

I hate you.

Jenny lies down by Rachel.

Jenny

Oh, Mummy. I'm so very, very tired.

Rachel turns over on the crib and faces away from 
Jenny.

Jenny

Good night.

Jenny lies down and turns her back to Rachel.

Rachel

You killed your mother.

Jenny

I'll call you if I need you.

Jenny turns and rests her head on the pillows, facing 
away from Rachel.
Rachel stirs and turns to Jenny.

Rachel

The bad lady.

Jenny turns and looks at Rachel.

Jenny

What did you call me?

Jenny watches Rachel.

Rachel

A bad lady.

Jenny

What?

Rachel

A bad lady.

Jenny

What?

Rachel

I'm going to die.

Jenny

You're not going to die.

Rachel

You've killed my mother.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:03
