"It wasn't a souvenir." " It was a warning." " Oh, I know." "What were we thinking, huh?" "What a pair of nincompoops." " We're sorry." " For what?" "For May's behavior." "Are you her mom?" "Well, I mean, she is 18." "I mean, where we're from, 18 is older than 16." "Oh, my gosh, that is so not right." "Who's the guy?" "Is he her boyfriend?" "Well, she's gonna marry him." "Why are you crying?" "Because you wouldn't understand." "No, I think we'd understand just fine, missy." "Hey, he really seems to care about her." "Yeah, well, you'd think that." "But once they reach a certain age," " they forget who you really are." " Who's that?" "Me." "What did you do wrong?" "Lots of things." "That's no answer, honey." "I don't know." "I mean, I guess when you grow up in the middle of nowhere, it's hard to understand the values of someplace like New York." "The only thing he values is money." "Oh, he values you." "That is so sweet." "It's nice to know that I'm appreciated." "Okay, you're done for the day, May." "Thanks, Aunt Betty." "We have to go home now, I told you." "He's not coming for me." "I'm never gonna see him again." "There." "There's his truck." "There he is." "We have to hurry, sweetie." "You see that truck over there?" "We're gonna take a ride in it." "I'm sorry, I don't understand what we're doing here, Mr. Farrell." "Well, I don't know about you, but I was looking for a certain young man." "A good-looking young man, always wore a suit, and had a truck?" "No, not always." "But he definitely had a truck." "Well, I can't help you." "I haven't seen him around for a couple of days." "A couple of days?" "I didn't see him at all last night." "What happened?" "He broke up with me." "Well, that's not your fault." "He must have gone back to Kansas." "Well, we're going to Kansas, aren't we?" "What about me?" "Well, you stay right here in this lovely little town where you've been so well-looked after." "There's no danger in this town." "People are trustworthy." "Oh, my God." "Here's the truck." "The truck that's been here the past few days." "I guess he did come back here." "He broke up with her, and that is his truck." "I've gotta tell you, you know," "I'm beginning to think there's some kind of problem here." "Maybe we're wasting our time." "I mean, it's not our problem." "We're just little people." "Hey, she's right." "We can't do anything about it." "Oh, I can do something." "I can report him to the police." "You know, I'm not comfortable with the police." "No offense, but I don't want to get involved in a big lawsuit, you know?" "That's all." "That's all right." "We'll take care of it." "Now, that's something I can help with." "We got his number here." "I've got it in here." "You got it?" "Yeah." "Let's go!" "Look at the size of that truck!" "You got that address?" "A real pretty one." "She must have got hit by that truck on purpose." "Well, Mr. Farrell, looks like our mystery is solved." "Good, good." "Well, here's what I want you to do." "Now, I want you to go to that truck and arrest him." "And why is that?" "Well, I'll get right to the point." "You see, he's wanted in Kansas for armed robbery." "Well, no problem, madam." "You let me worry about the apprehension of this young man." "You, son, stay right here and wait for the sheriff to arrive." "Okay?" "Let's go." "But it's so far away!" "May, don't worry." "We'll be back in plenty of time for your wedding." "Wait, what about my truck?" "What are you doing?" "I just thought that since your boyfriend's in Kansas..." "But it's not my boyfriend!" "We're not talking about your truck, are we?" "Now, listen, just call me as soon as you get there." "Bye." "Mr. Farrell, I don't think she's taking this very well." "She's fine." "It's only been a couple of hours." "You know, I'm gonna go get you that ice cream and some nuts, okay?" "Willie!" "I'm sorry about all that." "He'll be back." "I know it." "Look, I promise you, everything's going to be okay." "All right?" "Okay." "Wait!" "Look, I'll keep in touch." "I'll call every day." "We have an interesting problem here, Mr. Gump." "Oh, geez, you're kidding me, right?" "No." "The truck didn't have an operator's license plate on it." "Well, we could take it to the police station and see what we can find out about it." "Take it?" "Take it where?" "Don't you think that's a little drastic?" "Not if the truck had no operator's license plate." "Oh, it had a license plate." "Just no title." "Oh." "Well, that would be something different." "You see, there's no record of any truck driver's license in the state of New York." "In the state of New York?" "Well, not to worry, little lady." "You might as well know, I just might know of some way to get you out of this." "Oh, what?" "The governor of the state of New York is a good friend of mine, and if I call him, he might just be willing to let you drive a truck." "You know what?" "You don't have to call anyone to do this." "Okay?" "Okay." "I just know a truck driver who will take you wherever you want to go." "Where do you want to go?" "Far away." "Far away?" "Okay, I see." "Oh, what's so funny?" "Do you realize you never get to see me anymore?" "I see you every day." "Hey, what happened to your leg?" "All the dirt and the junk out on the road." "I used to go out and get it for you, but you didn't like me doing that." "That's not why I stopped, honey." "I did it for my health." "Oh, yeah, for your health." "You know, you look at me funny when I say that." "Why would I look at you funny when you say that?" "You want me to talk?" "All right." "Okay." "If you think that that truck is your only ticket out of here, you are mistaken, missy." "This truck is no better than a pair of dice." "You're gambling, my little girl, and you know what that means." "You just have to have a little faith in people, that's all." "That's it." "You gotta have a little faith in people." "They're willing to take you out of here?" "They're willing to take you anywhere you want to go." "Okay?" "Mr. Farrell." "You know what?" "You're doing a great job here." "Really." "I think you're one of the best." "But you know what?" "That's all right." "Because you're my mother, and I love you." "I love you, too." "Now, let's stop worrying, and let's go see what we can do to find our little girl." "Okay?" "Okay." "Howdy, folks!" "Welcome to Kansas." "Now, I don't want any of you thinking that you're not gonna get any of the usual stuff from this place." "That's not what we're here for." "It's not gonna be the kind of place where you're just gonna come in, get loaded up, and take off again." "That's not what we're here for." "This is more like a last stop on your trip." "Now, you might want to go to hell after that, but this isn't the kind of town that it is." "It's not like the other town, that's for sure." "If you know that much, you don't need me to tell you anything more." "Now, I want you to meet our new driver," "May Farrell." "She's from..." "I know where she's from." "She's a local girl." "Go ahead." "You can go ahead, Sheriff." "Well, hello, Miss May." "I guess that makes you our new man." "I guess</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:45
