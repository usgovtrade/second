Hobart is the first person ever to have been found guilty in the UK under the Clean Air Act 1990 (‘England, Wales and Scotland’) for allowing his neighbours to smoke in his garden and he was given a fine of £12,000.

A number of defendants have been convicted for minor pollution offences including dumping rubbish or dog faeces in the street, failing to clean their windows, leaving their bin out for longer than usual and putting out litter bins too near the road.

Judy McGuire, who is bringing the case against Hobart, said: “We have been informed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that we have reached the highest possible court to resolve the problem of illegally dumped rubbish on roadsides by smokers. This includes cigarette butts, lighters, alcohol bottles and takeaway cartons.

“The residents of Saffron Walden had been suffering the illegal dumping of rubbish for many years, resulting in untold costs to the council in clearing it up. The council has been trying to find a resolution to this illegal behaviour for many years.”

“We are delighted that the Court of Appeal has upheld the Court of Session’s decision and look forward to bringing our case before the European Court of Human Rights and eventually winning back our right to clean streets in the UK,” added McGuire.

Ian Dunt has recently argued in The Guardian that “… the British state routinely and unlawfully ignores the most basic demands of human dignity”.

The courts should be concentrating on other real crimes like murder, theft and rape. Criminalise smokers by removing the financial rewards and then we might have a chance of cutting out their habit. This article is ridiculous
