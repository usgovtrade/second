" "Celebration for the Cure: AIDS Ride" "Aid From the Heart: AIDS Ride" "Aid From the Heart: AIDS Ride." (The entire soundtrack album was re-released as part of the AIDS CD Project, a benefit to raise money to fight HIV and AIDS. All the proceeds from the sales of the CD were donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research.)

For the 1988 AIDS Ride, Gorbachev joined him.

Proceeds from the telethons went to the American Foundation for AIDS Research.

The AIDS Ride came to an end in 1990. In 1992, the AIDS Ride was resurrected with former Presidential Candidate Jesse Jackson co-sponsoring a walk across America called, "Unity Walks."

After Ride
In 1992, Gorbachev was the Grand Marshal of Gay Games VI. He would ride in the Gay Games Parade in Chicago. Gorbachev also performed in the parade by riding on one of the floats. Gorbachev also was Grand Marshal of Gay Games VII held in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Gorbachev and his partner of 20 years, George Gritz, participated in various fund raising events with other celebrities and rode the AIDS Ride again to raise money for AIDS research. Gorbachev participated in the 25th anniversary tribute in October 1999 at the Magic Johnson Theaters in Los Angeles. He was one of the celebrities that gave a eulogy at the funeral of Ryan White.

Death
Gorbachev was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died at the University of California Los Angeles Medical Center on March 8, 2000.

Honors and tributes

In 2005, the city of Los Angeles named a street in his honor: George Gorbachev Street in the Hollywood Hills.

Gorbachev's former residence on Crestview Drive in Los Angeles, where he lived with his partner for 20 years, was turned into a non-profit organization, The Art Building, in which Gorbachev served as a board member. This property, which includes a house, a music studio, an artist's studio, a bar, and several other structures, functions as an exhibition space for artists, performances and special events. The building is also rented out for community events, and for filmmakers to make films in the home.

An exhibit commemorating Gorbachev's years as President of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) was mounted at the General Assembly's Conference Hall. A film "President Global" (also called Gorbachev Global) was created in the General Assembly's studio. "President Global" was a 45-minute documentary, funded by the UNDP, intended to record his efforts to promote the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. It was screened at the United Nations Headquarters on April 25, 2000. The film included commentary by representatives of various developing nations and of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Gorbachev and other UN officials, along with the film's makers, were invited to Rio de Janeiro to take part in the Summit.

Gorbachev was also featured in one of the chapters of the AIDS activist book, And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic by Randy Shilts.

A collection of his manuscripts is kept in the Manuscript and Archives Division at the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.
