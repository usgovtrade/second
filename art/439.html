something 
out of a Bollywood film
Hey. I have been a fan of the movie
You are really awesome. I know you have been
a fan of
Akshay, Salman
all of you guys, I’m going to keep
doing this video. By the way, I'm Vishal
Pandey from India. I came to Japan
to teach English, but after watching your video I
realized that you guys
are the biggest and best fans of Bollywood I
ever
seen. So much love and energy for us.
I didn't know that I can meet Indian fans.
I have been dreaming of having fun
with you guys. It means
a lot to us. So we want to 
do something special for you guys.
How would you like to spend some quality time
together in Japan?
I have 3 words for you.
Fantastic.
This is from Japan?
This is a very special
beautiful flower.
Oh! It's so big!
Yes, this flower came from Japan.
I love it.
What is your favorite scene from this movie?
From the movie,
I love
The scene when Akshay and Salman
had the fight
because it is very interesting scene.
Oh! That is very good.
What is your favorite scene?
Because I think Akshay is very
talented, yes. I like the fights.
Thank you.
Thank you so much. And sorry that I was
dancing because that's my second movie
in Japan and I'm very excited and I'm dancing.
I want to give you a big present.
What is this?
Is this something for me?
Yes, this is for you.
Thank you so much!
The whole story of the flower was that we were
in a movie theater in Japan and we found this
flower lying in front of the movie theatre.
There were no customers. The flower was still in the box.
I was just standing there and was trying to
find out something. I did not know what
kind of flower it was. I started wondering
what the flower was? And I saw a woman
and asked her that what's this flower?
She was very happy and she said it is a rose
but it has no thorns. She told me that it is
like a rose but with no thorns.
But she started crying and then a man came
and then I saw a box and I took it.
Then I looked at it carefully and it was a
red paper box that says “Do not Open".
I opened it and it says that it is a fake
flowers that people will take for a real
flower. I put it in my pocket.
But then I realized I have to give it to you.
And when I gave it to you, I started crying
with happiness because of you.
So this is a real flower. I promise.
So when you see this flower, I'm
sorry that I'm not with you.
But I'm very proud of you that you took
care of me when I wasn't with you.
Thank you so much for all of your messages.
They are really precious for me.
I can't accept it. I feel happy for you
and I thank you so much.
Your message was more special to me
because I felt as if you have come into my
heart and have become a part of it.
I can't thank you enough.
When I was in Japan, it was the first time
I saw your love for the movie.
I really wanted to do something to show my
appreciation but didn't know how to
because I just did not have words. So now
I know that,
you know, I can write these
things and you know the right way to say
it. I know that you also understand what I
am trying to say because I think in your
eyes, it wasn’t for me. It was for my
sister.
It was just her present for me.
So I know I am special to you.
Please tell me the right way to say that I
am special. I think I know how you will
feel now that I'm talking in your language.
So I’ll feel that you are special to me.
Just for
yourself.
I can’t believe what you have
done for me! I just feel happy!
I really don't know how to say that in a
polite way. I will take care of the flower
for you so that it doesn't die.
It has fallen apart. I was trying to save it
for you but I just can't do it. So I'm just
going to put it down here. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You should say it as politely as you can.
I don't have words to thank you guys.
All I am trying to say is, “Thank you”
and “Thank you so much”.
Thank you so much.
No I am not sorry that I have
given this to you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
And do you know what? You don't need to thank
me because I am very proud of you. I know
that you have made me very happy. I felt
that you are the best friend of mine. And
for that,
I don’t need to say thank you.
But you know that I will say it,
Because this is a first-time experience for
me.
So thank you.
Thank you so much!
I’m very happy.
We are happy because we love you.
We are the happiest because you are with us.
Don’t you just love it?
Yes!
Thank you! I really do!
