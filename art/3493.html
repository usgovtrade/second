Why is he shooting?’ ” Capers said with a laugh. “Now he’s been in the league three years and he’s just doing whatever he wants to do. He’s an unbelievable player. It wasn’t a major adjustment. We do a lot of things in our offense where we have multiple things going. He was just one of those players that can take any kind of stuff and put it into the game.”

Ricky Tjong-A-Tjoe, who is one of nine defensive linemen, said he loves to keep blockers off Green, who can take them off the field.

“He can create those types of things by himself because of his skill set, his athletic ability and his combination with his hands and vision,” Tjong-A-Tjoe said. “He’s got that unique ability to be able to see a crease to shoot out of it and to turn out of it and just take it for himself. He does it in a smooth, fluid way, and I love it. He’s like that everywhere he goes. On special teams he’s doing the same thing with the return game. He’s a great player for us.”

Banks said Green “helps open the game for us” with his speed and athleticism.

“With all the stuff he can do on special teams and the offense, it’s one of those ‘Oh, man. Just take a look at this guy,’” Banks said.

As Green puts it, “You just feel like you’ve got some talent around you, and I’m just blessed to have those guys there to back me up.”

And he’s going to be back to back the same thing this week against the Bengals.

“I don’t know about how he does his game. He just tells me to run out of bounds and to punt it out,” Banks said.

Green just hopes to become an integral part of the Packers’ offense, which has been re-built around quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

“It’s more of an emphasis on us as D-linemen because if we get a hold of the O-linemen, he’s just making good things happen,” Banks said. “If he gets any type of advantage it’s on us to knock him back.”

Green sees a similar dynamic with his roommate, nose tackle Kenny Clark, who leads the Packers with two forced fumbles and fumble recoveries.

“Me and Kenny are kind of a tandem of the outside guys, and I love it,” Green said. “I love that. I really feel like it’s one of the best duos in football and I just try to give him the freedom to do what he wants to do. I just tell him where to go.

“He’s very intelligent, very strong, physical, and very unselfish, and I’m really proud of him.”

Green is getting used to his popularity in Green Bay, where he has made a significant impact on the game.

“With the success we’ve been having on special teams it’s allowed people to start recognizing me,” Green said. “It’s been awesome.”

The rest of the NFL should catch on.
