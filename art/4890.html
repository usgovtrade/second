When thinking of business speed, most people think of the latest technology.

Google has taken what was once a very human task and automated it into a few keystrokes and clicks. How about automation for real-world tasks like taking care of client calls, handling correspondence, or making sales?

A lot of tasks in business take place inside of software. A company might not need a software engineer to code or a programmer to design, but there’s no doubt that software has changed many aspects of business.

Let’s use business speed to analyze a couple ways that software helps businesses be more productive.

Let’s analyze three productivity-boosting software tools and see what you can use to help your company be more productive.

One great tool to boost productivity is Slack. Slack is a software product that helps teams stay on task, stay in the loop, and find important things to accomplish.

Slack allows for instant messages, documents, project management, and even video and screen sharing. We have used Slack in our personal lives to stay in touch with friends and family, and it has allowed us to keep up with our teams.

Slack is free for teams up to 12 users and starting at $6.67 per user monthly after the free trial period. You can also create a custom pricing plan that works for your team. Slack has made getting work done easier for more than 6 million teams.

Slack might not seem like a big deal at first, but it is a critical business tool that might make all the difference for your organization. It could improve communication, improve efficiency, and drive your company forward.

Another great way to boost productivity is the use of Microsoft Teams. Teams is one of the most popular collaboration and communication platforms for enterprises and mid-size businesses.

Teams is a chat-based solution for communicating with customers and employees with built-in messaging, video conferencing, audio conferencing, and screen sharing.

Companies like Walmart, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google use Teams for team communication, project planning, and even marketing and sales.

Teams is the backbone for collaboration in large businesses, and it’s very easy to get started. Teams offers a free plan that can handle up to 300 users, with additional paid plans for teams of 500 or more.

Another product that helps drive productivity and efficiency is a mobile app called Focus@Will.

Focus@Will’s primary focus is time management and organization. Focus@Will allows you to track goals, set to-do lists, make notes, create schedules, track finances, and even track food and drinks.

Focus@Will does this all through its mobile app, which you can use to scan bar codes for recipes, make lists, and even upload files. You can even talk into the app and give commands to help control the software.

The company also has a software to allow managers to take control of their day-to-day. From controlling the amount of time employees spend on Facebook, to blocking distracting websites, this solution has proven to be very effective at improving productivity.

These are just a few tools to help boost productivity. Don’t stop at these three – there are many others that can help your business become more organized and effective.
