/*
 * The three fields in a syment data structure encode the binding of the three
 * symbol types. We have just discussed the strong extern and the weak extern
 * symbols, so we only have to discuss the local extern symbol type here.
 *
 * The encoding of the local extern binding is a 3-bit bit field containing the
 * local extern, strong extern and weak extern symbols. The bit field is used as
 * follows:
 *   - The first bit is always zero.
 *   - If there is a strong extern, the second bit is zero, and the third bit
 *     is one if and only if the symbol is weak (extern).
 *   - If there is no strong extern symbol, the second bit is one.
 *   - If there is no symbol at all, i.e. the symbol is to be emitted in a
 *     compilation only DSO, the second bit is zero.
 *
 * This allows any external data object to be bound as a local extern data
 * object. It also allows more than one object to be bound as a local extern
 * object.
 *
 * Note that the local extern binding need not necessarily be constant if it is
 * not to be emitted as a compilation only DSO. This means that a section may
 * have weak local extern symbols, even if its index symbol table entry has a
 * value of 0 (i.e. NULL</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:32:46
