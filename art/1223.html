Prize Corner - *sigh* - this is really gonna be hard, people.



The only thing about the prize corner that I enjoy is writing. I only like the challenge of creating a story for that one moment. The rest of it is just tedious.



I made a challenge for myself to create a story for the prize corner, and also have the story written before December 24th. No story I’ve come up with seems to fit, which is the only reason the prize corner is incomplete. I’m just not going to submit one.



Instead, I’ve gone with that one idea I’ve been thinking about since September last year: a collection of stories about people with the same name as a video game character. Because there was that one post of mine that spawned these ideas.



The prize corner is going to be about multiple people named in the story. I don’t know how many there are, maybe three? And it won’t be in a linear order of any kind. Also, while we might have a main protagonist, I’m not sure yet.



There might be a story about people with the same name as, say, Mario. A few unrelated events happen that may or may not affect one person. One character will be from another world in the Mario universe, and will be the “main” character of the story. Then there’s this one other character who’s had a similar life experience, except that one, he got to go home. That’s the main story in this collection.



That’s my idea for the prize corner.



So now, we move on.



…

Okay, so I’m thinking this challenge might just be better served by not writing, because the only way to keep it interesting is to create so many stories that it doesn’t matter what’s chosen. My idea is for someone to read a single story (to be decided), and put in some kind of challenge to be fulfilled in the next story.



For example: A “soul” needs to be put into an object (something we can play on) within a specific number of words (20 for example). Or maybe a character needs to break something, or walk up to someone in the story, and the next person they talk to will know their “secret” identity.



It could get complicated. It could get tedious. But that’s just the point. It’s different.



But I have a couple of ideas. I can post them here later.



On to the challenge.



———



Challenge #1 - Write a short story about someone playing a video game (preferably a single-player adventure-style game). Think “The Fellowship of the Ring”, where the fellowship of the ring goes on a trip. The character can be anything, except in the game. Just pick a video game that is not played by a group.



My game: Stardew Valley

You’re going to die here, and you probably don’t know why. Maybe you’ll be playing this game, or a different game, and suddenly, you’ll get hurt. At first it’s only something as mundane as a bruise, maybe even an old scar you got when you were six. But later, it gets worse, your body hurts more and more all the time. Your eyesight fails, your memory vanishes, all of your muscles go into spasms and your entire body crumbles to a pile of dust, eventually becoming part of the very ground that you walk on. A moment later, you are killed by the same player who sent you to this place to do away with you, and the world is restored to the way it was.



But what if this happened?



What if someone you played a video game with decided to kill you. What would you do? And would that help you in any way, shape, or form? Is there any way you could stop them?



I once played a video game with a friend and we killed an NPC while playing as one of the main protagonists. In that case it was because the game forced me to do it in a situation where he was the most vulnerable. I was never afraid to off my friend, but I guess you can’t blame me for just trying to help him out. It was a video game after all, and we were in character. If a video game made you kill someone in the game, would you do it?



What kind of games do you play? What kinds of characters are you?



———



Challenge #2 - Write a story about someone with the same name as a video game character, and it has to be someone who isn’t the main character. For example, the character has to meet someone who is in the game as a minor character, but it doesn’t have to be the same as the character you’re writing. I’ll provide examples. For example:



- The main character is called “Chris”. The story isn’t about him, but the character is in the game. - The main character is called “Mario”. The story isn’t about him, but the character is in the game. - The main character is called “Aryss”. The story isn’t about him, but the character is in the game. - The main character is called “Mort” (that was the actual name of my character in Dark Souls 2). The story is about that character, and they aren’t related. - The main character is called “Yoshii”. That’s not my character’s name, but you could use that character in your story. - The main character is called “Yoshii”, and they aren’t related to that character either.



So, again, the character can’t be in the story. Also, please make them sound different from your game character.



Here’s what to do: I’ll post all of the names in a random order. At the end, I’ll pick the story, and I’ll pick a reader who will pick the story that they think the story in the challenge (to be posted) is about.



My game: Dark Souls 2

Name: “Valkyria Chronicles”

Name: “Jorina”

Name: “Yoshii”

Name: “Spencer”

Challenge #3 - Write a story that has the same theme/element as the video game’s, as set by the community. For example, my game is all about monsters and magic, so my challenge would be that “the protagonist is a demon who must fight against another demon”. I’ll provide examples. For example:



- The protagonist is a werewolf. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a demon. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a witch. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a vampire. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is an angel. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a human who was cursed to be a monster. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a demon. The theme would be demons. - The protagonist is a monster. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is an angel. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a werewolf. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a witch. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a vampire. The theme would be monsters and magic. - The protagonist is a demon who was cursed to be a monster. The theme would be monsters and magic.



So, again, the theme of the story has to be the same as the themes/elements in your video game. Also, please make them sound different from your game character.



Here’s what to do: I’ll post all of the names in a random order. At the end, I’ll pick the story, and I’ll pick a reader who will pick the story that they think the story in the challenge</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:38
