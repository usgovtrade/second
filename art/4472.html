The plastic-bag ban was a key plank in the NDP campaign, and it's led to the B.C. Green Party, which ran on a promise to create the world's first zero-waste government, to become the first party in 40 years to elect official status.

The NDP won 43 seats — 22 more than the Greens — in the May 9 election, largely due to the party's focus on a platform of fighting climate change and creating jobs.

New Democrats have so far introduced a ban on single-use plastic bags, straws and utensils in the North. Meanwhile, municipal governments have also begun their own campaigns to tackle single-use plastic — Edmonton's is slated for October.

At a press conference Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to a question about the NDP-Green alliance to ban single-use plastic, saying he was "happy" B.C. was moving forward on an anti-plastic-bag ban.

But he wouldn't answer if the federal government would introduce similar legislation.

"B.C. has made its decision," Trudeau said.

"We will be keeping an eye on what they are doing."

Trudeau has publicly mused about a nationwide ban on single-use plastic shopping bags but has not followed through on those remarks.

Instead, the government introduced amendments to the federal Clean Water and Waste Act last December, laying out a timeline to ban single-use plastic grocery bags, straws, cutlery and plates by the middle of 2021.

But this timeline has created tensions between governments at both the municipal and provincial levels.

Most recently, Toronto has threatened to sue the federal government over its plans to phase out single-use plastic bags in the country's largest city.

The City of Ottawa has also been vocal in its opposition to the federal government's plan.

At an event hosted by a think-tank on Wednesday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced his party would also ban the use of single-use plastic grocery bags, straws, cutlery and plates if elected.

But Scheer said Alberta will never follow suit and will fight the NDP's "green extremist" policies at the federal level.

"Jason Kenney is leading the fight against the NDP's anti-jobs, anti-growth agenda," he said.

Kenney echoed Scheer's stance on Thursday.

"Our position is clear: no to this," Kenney told reporters at the legislature.

"Alberta's leadership on fighting climate change is rooted in our respect for nature, and we're not going to be intimidated by Justin Trudeau's failed attempt to do the same thing. Alberta's plan for fighting climate change is better than Justin Trudeau's plan for making life more expensive."

On Thursday, Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said he believes Alberta will not follow suit in introducing a ban on plastic bags and will instead wait for the national ban.

"It is clear that Alberta must work with the federal government on the issue, and we are eager to collaborate with them on a shared national strategy on reducing plastics," Wilkinson said in an emailed statement.

"We look forward to having discussions with the government on this. We look forward to this national approach and its impact to reducing plastics."

Trudeau's national ban on plastic bags, straws and utensils came with a "sunset clause" that would automatically scrap it after five years.

That means the plastic-bag ban is not scheduled to come into effect until July 2021, by which time it would be a moot point because the entire country will be under an NDP government.

Kenney has also said he is opposed to the federal ban, which he has said will cost Canadian businesses more than $600 million in additional costs and force them to reallocate resources to the costly production of alternative plastic bags and packaging.

Kenney has also said a tax on plastic bags would be a better way to reduce waste.

On Thursday, the City of Edmonton announced it is already on the lookout for a sustainable single-use plastic ban — as early as 2019.

According to the city, plastic bag use is the single biggest contributor to waste in Edmonton and costs the city more than $2 million a year in resources.

'This is the single greatest thing that a premier can do to protect the environment and the economy of this province,' says NDP Leader Rachel Notley. 7:34

The city estimates a five per cent drop in plastic bag use could save the city $10 million to $15 million.

The city has also estimated its ban would prevent 4.5 million plastic bags from entering Alberta's waste stream annually and save 4.6 million plastic bags that would otherwise be discarded, which it said is the equivalent of reducing carbon emissions by 3,700 tonnes per year.

The city plans to hold consultations on the issue and will present its final plan to council in the fall.

Alberta not following B.C. government in banning plastic bags

B.C. NDP Premier John Horgan introduced legislation in April that banned the distribution of thin-film plastics bags at retail stores starting in July this year.

The bill would go into effect Jan. 1, 2020.

It will be up to each province to come up with its own regulations for how retailers will accept bulk plastic bags, such as bringing in your own reusable bags or buying the thin-film ones provided by the company.

B.C. is also implementing a 15-cent fee on plastic bags.

Alberta's government is not proposing a phase-out of single-use plastic bags in Alberta, and has not indicated if it has plans to impose a plastic bag fee or tax on single-use plastic bags, nor have any industry groups.

In fact, the government of Alberta has made moves to block such a policy. In May 2018, the province introduced a ban on polystyrene food packaging and foam cups.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:27
