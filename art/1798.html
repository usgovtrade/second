"Is that true?" "That's what he told me." "It was his specialty." "The ice-cold beer." "My son-in-law's a master." "Where are we going?" "Don't worry, it's all taken care of." "You leave everything to me, I see to it." "Take this, son." "Come here." "If I don't do it, who will?" "Go and get a shovel." "Where do I find one?" "You find one." "What if it's broken?" "The handle!" "Here you are." "It's old and tarnished." "I found it in the attic." "Look how sharp it is!" "You can't find a better one." "Is it a spade?" "A spade, for sure." "Look, it's an old spade!" "And a rusty one at that." "Look how rusty it is." "It's rusty and rotten." "And yet, we've got to go and bury a saint..." "In this rotten spade." "Look, Grandma, I've found a spade!" "Oh, good, good." "Can you get up in the grave with this?" "Just help us to get the saint in." "Why me?" "You're a saint." "And you will be next." "But I want to do it with my own hands, not God's." "You'll see, it's a beautiful sight." "What do we need this for?" "He was a saint!" "He is a saint!" "The first and the last." "What are you saying, you tramp?" "He's still inside." "The earth takes a long time to move." "And the old ones are very heavy." "Come on, get him out, quickly!" "It's too bad." "It's all over." "What do you mean?" "We're not even halfway yet." "This way." "Come on." "Come on, come on!" "Come on, move the bones!" "Get it out of here." "Leave it there, leave it!" "It's already in a coffin!" "We'll soon put a board in there." "No, my son, we won't." "I mean, I can't stand it." "It's too disgusting to watch." "Get him out of there!" "I see, you'd like to watch him." "Well, I can't stand it." "I can't stand it." "You are doing him a favour." "You take his body out." "You two get the cross." "I'll handle the skull." "Let me lift him now!" "Go on, go on!" "Goodness me, my sons." "What are we doing?" "We'll throw it in the well." "It's not even holy." "Get the cross and follow me." "He was a saint, he must be treated with respect." "Come on, he'll get lost without it." "I'll put it in the well." "I'll put it in the well." "You can't throw it down there." "You hear me?" "You can't." "It's sacred." "What do you think, you'll get it dirty?" "Come on, take the cross." "I've got him." "He's moving." "Come on!" "My wife is at the window." "She can see everything!" "Come on!" "Come on, that's it, don't look back, you idiot!" "Let's get out of here!" "Let's get out of here!" "Let's get out of here!" "What happened?" "What happened?" "Is he alive?" "Get him up, get him up!" "Get him up!" "Where are you taking him?" "What are you doing?" "Where?" "In the well!" "Help him to get up!" "It's not him!" "He's not the saint!" "He was the real saint, I saw him." "The saint is buried." "There's the cross in the well!" "You have to believe me." "Are you stupid?" "Why would I make it up?" "It's all your fault." "I saw him, I saw the saint." "I saw him." "Get him out of here!" "There's the saint, right there!" "Help me to pull him out!" "Wait, wait!" "What a fine day, a day to honour the dead." "God has a great sense of irony." "We came to bury a saint, but you are leaving this earth as one." "Don't be sad, my son." "He's smiling." "The Lord has finally finished the job he was born for." "And if it had to be in this terrible way, in this horrifying manner..." "You wouldn't take me away, not from this house, nor from that other one." "I haven't done much good, because..." "But you can be sure that I'm going to heaven." "Yes, I'm going to get away from here." "But you have to bury me in the cemetery." "I'm the one who buries people here." "Then I'll come to you myself and carry you out." "You'll have to come yourself." "The dead are very jealous of their rest." "I had to bury the priest over there." "That's true, but he was dead." "God knows he's not the first one to bury in the wrong place." "But I want to be buried with my sisters." "Do as I say." "Just don't cry, my son." "Let's bury this woman who was such a saint and didn't even have a husband." "That's it, we're going to bury you now." "Let's get the cross and let's take the saint with us." "Then I'll carry you out myself, because you're very heavy." "Wait, wait a second, we still have to bury..." "Why can't I be buried here?" "I don't want to be buried here." "I don't want to be buried here either." "There's no one left." "We're only burying a woman who isn't even dead." "I don't want to be buried here either." "This has been a big day for us, brother." "Yes." "And it's not over yet." "They're still alive in there." "It's them!" "They've come back to life!" "The two brothers!" "They've killed him!" "They've killed him again!" "Come on!" "Where's he going?" "He's not there." "What?" "He's not in the other room." "What?" "The third brother was still alive." "He ran away, because I wouldn't wait for him." "He went out the window and down to the square." "That's when the cross fell on me and I saw the Holy Virgin." "Then I had a vision." "I saw her and I knew what she wanted." "The holy vision!" "The holy vision!" "They came to me, all three of them." "The three brothers who were alive again and brought the miracle with them." "Let's go." "They're still there." "Let's go!" "Let's go!" "Don't stay here, because he's got too many brothers." "Don't worry, he'll come back." "He wouldn't dare show up here!" "He doesn't dare show up here again." "What are you talking about?" "It was they who did it all, they did the evil deed." "Let's go." "That's the house." "Don't go, don't go!" "They've taken my handkerchief." "Let's go, let's go." "They've gone down that street and turned the corner." "They've gone to where he lives." "What's he doing there?" "He must be waiting for us." "He's waiting for us there." "Yes, but..." "We shouldn't go up to a man's house." "Let's take it easy." "The one who is going up is me." "You stay here." "You're scared!" "How can I stay here?" "I have no fear." "I feel no fear, none at all." "If the saint doesn't come back, I can come back down to you." "The saint is here, he's back now." "If he hadn't died, he wouldn't have needed to come back." "You don't know that." "But I do." "You don't." "We're going up to his house to have a look." "Let's go, let's go." "My son, my son." "What have you brought here?" "A saint, who we buried and then a saint, who returned to life." "His mother asked me to come with him." "I've found this on him." "A piece of wood." "He's a saint, you know." "That's right, saints do miracles." "We can see for ourselves." "Did you kill him?" "No, it was an accident." "We thought he was dead and then he came back to life." "We brought him back." "It must have been a miracle." "It was." "There's no other explanation." "This is the handkerchief of the saint." "Look, it has been dipped in his blood." "They must have killed him again, the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:31
