On this first episode of Closer in 24 Days, we talk about the first week of Trump’s presidency, including his visit to CIA headquarters, his controversial phone calls, and his address to Congress. We discuss this president’s first week as commander in chief, and how his campaign pledges are starting to change and evolve. On this episode, we also examine the possible reasons for the president’s decision to bypass reporters and speak only to a crowd of lawmakers, the importance of being seen by an audience of lawmakers and other officials, and the power that President Trump is wielding when he is able to make a single decision that impacts thousands.

Trump is the first President since Ulysses S. Grant to have been sworn into office on January 20. This episode will allow us to explore the significance of the first week of a new presidency, the impact of this week on our overall perceptions of Trump, and the ramifications of decisions that impact millions of Americans.

We hope you enjoy this episode, and please let us know if you have questions, comments, or stories you’d like for us to discuss.
