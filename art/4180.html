It is common to run a casing or liner in a wellbore, e.g., casing, during completion of a well. Prior to this operation, sensors, such as pressure and temperature sensors, are placed in the wellbore to provide data used in determining whether the well has been drilled in the proper place. In some instances, the data measured may also be used to adjust the direction of drilling or in placing the casing in the proper location. Such data is useful because the shape of the wellbore may be distorted from the true vertical position as a result of the frictional contact between the drill string and borehole wall. Because of this, a depth measurement as close to true depth as possible is desirable. Other systems used to measure wellbore conditions also include sensors, such as gamma ray sensors and other similar sensors, which provide data regarding the formation through which the wellbore is drilled.
The sensors are coupled to a controller by wireline, cable, tubing, or other known manner. Unfortunately, these cables, tubings, and the like are subject to damage due to the hostile nature of the wellbore environment. Once damaged, it is difficult to access and replace the cable, tubing, and the like. It would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus that would detect data being measured by a sensor and that would alert the operator of an impending problem with the data transmission line. It would also be desirable to adjust the data transmission line to provide improved quality control of data. It would further be desirable to alert the operator when the quality of transmitted data has degraded below a predetermined threshold.
Another method to measure wellbore conditions is via wireless transmission from the sensors to a receiver and to the surface. However, the wireless signals, especially for sensors used in a wellbore, are subject to noise as the signals traverse up through the wellbore. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus to measure downhole conditions without the noise due to transmission of the signal through the wellbore. It would also be desirable to filter the noise of the wireless transmission so that the sensor can transmit accurate data to the surface.
Another important aspect of wellbore measurements is the ability to transmit signals to the surface in real-time and in a manner that is compatible with surface systems. It is well known to run electronic components in casings, tubings, or drill strings. It would be desirable to have the ability to provide power to the electronic components in the wellbore. It would be desirable to have the ability to provide power to the electronic components without reliance on the surface systems. The present invention addresses these and other needs in the art.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:31
