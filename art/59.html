Our story begins with the world. For the last few thousand years, it's
been divided up into tiny pieces, each piece belonging to a race, who then get to run around
the edges of the world, fighting each other, and taking their lands, and keeping everything
nice and quiet. But every race has a few people in it who are more interested in keeping
things to themselves than anything else. They are called the Mages, and they do things like
find treasure, or magic...

Chapter 2.  One day, a few thousand years from now, a young mage named Aya stumbled
upon a secret.  It was a secret known to mages, but never told to anyone.  For most
of the world, in fact.  She also happened to be of the most powerful family in all of
Manhattan.  Their family house was once a library, which the family has been guarding
ever since they were exiled from the rest of the world.  While they guarded the house, they
lived in the basement, and rarely ventured into the library.  For the family had no
idea the world was filled with secrets...

Chapter 3.  The story picks up several years later, as Aya is still a little girl and
starting her first year at her family's estate.  But now she's grown up and no longer a
virgin.  She has also found a book hidden away in the house, a book full of secrets about
her family.  She starts putting these secrets to the test, for once she's done she'll find
out her very fate.

Chapter 4.  Aya is sixteen, she has two years to live, and she's spent the past six
years trying to be an orphan.  At this point in her life she'd given up any hope of
finding a boyfriend, because she'd always assumed she'd become an orphan.  So
she's more than a little surprised to find out one day that there are other people
like her, who are looking for a true family.

Chapter 5.  She is Aya, and this is her story.

Chapter 6.  Now it's winter, and Aya is going to meet the man she knows will change
her life.  The man she will marry, and begin a new life together.  But before she does, she's
going to have to survive this winter, and make sure that she, and the others, survive
long enough to get home to their own time.

Chapter 7.  So that's what's going to happen.  Well, that's what's going to happen
to the other girls too, but since this story is all about Aya, that's what's going to
happen to her...

Chapter 8.  The end of the story starts now.

Chapter 9.  So, this is the last installment of the first story, and this story,
Aya's story, is done.  This was a pretty long story, and Aya has decided she's
not going to write any more stories unless she can get this story published.  However,
if she does decide to write more, the next one will be shorter.  It will be much easier
for her to finish.  With this last installment, I am sure that you have enough of a
story idea for the next one.  You know, the sequel.

Now, I'm going to list what you're looking for.  What you're looking for, or
what I'm looking for, is a story about two mages.  These mages have a bit of a
history between them.  I don't need any explanations on how the story will play out
between them, although I'm sure you'd be able to give me some.  What I need,
though, is the other side of the story.  I need some background.  I need to know
who the two mages are, and why they're mages, and what happened before they
met, and even why they never met.  Some answers to these questions will
be provided in future installments of this story, but I need a history.
So I've included a background with this story.  A few of the things in it are
facts, and a few are facts that aren't always true, but will be true for these
mages.

Chapter 10.

This is our story.  The history of these two mages begins in a city known as
Nantucket, in the far west of America.  In the year 1500 AD, the city of Nantucket
was the most prosperous city in all of America.  It's economy was based off of its
trading with Native Americans for furs and other goods.  Then in the year 1550 AD,
Europe was hit with a deadly plague, which decimated its population.  While
Nantucket was untouched by the plague, most of its population also perished.  In
the days of the European settlers, there was a rumor that the Plague was being
spread by "Mage-like people".  The city was afraid, and banned the use
of magery by its citizens, though no one could find any sort of proof that this
rumor was true.  A few years later, in the year 1590 AD, Nantucket was decimated
again.  This time, it was by an earthquake.  For the past thousand years,
Nantucket had been hit by many different natural disasters, and the people of the
city never stopped rebuilding.  This particular quake damaged much of the city,
and when it was finally rebuilt it was mostly just stone.  In the year 1593 AD,
the plague returned to Nantucket, and killed another quarter of its population.
For the second time, the city was decimated.  Once again, this time even worse
than the first time.  This time, the city itself was destroyed, and there
was no way of repairing it.  In the years following this second death, the city
fell into ruins, and it slowly became known as the Lost City of Nantucket.

Chapter 11.

In the year 1598 AD, a young boy named Aya was born to a couple who lived in
Nantucket.  He was a mage, and even though the laws had been passed about a thousand
years ago, Aya was forbidden from using his magery.  His parents were also from
the Mage-race, and one of his great-great-grandfathers, who was also a mage, had
a daughter who lived in Nantucket.  Their family was one of the powerful families
in the city, but their house had become an orphanage, and they'd been living in the
basement of the house since the day they were exiled.  It was only due to the fact
that Aya's father was the owner of the house that he wasn't forced to leave it.  For
Aya's father had no interest in seeing his family's power taken away.

Chapter 12.

Aya's parents died when he was twelve, and their death broke his father's heart.
He'd been trying to find a woman to marry, to no success.  However, when Aya
turned sixteen, he finally did find a woman to marry.  His family was wealthy, and
could easily afford a wedding, but his mother died just before the wedding, so he
had no one to give him away.  But on the day of the wedding, when Aya's stepmother
and her family came to visit him and his new wife, an interesting thing happened.
While she was in the house, she heard a loud noise from down below.  Her curiosity
took her, and she went to investigate, only to find a small girl sitting in the
basement, playing a harp.  The girl had long golden hair, and was crying, but the
girl couldn't stop.  She wanted to be free.

Chapter 13.

Aya and his wife were both curious about the girl, and the woman asked Aya what
her story was.  Aya explained that she'd lived in the basement of the house
for a thousand years, but that she'd found a secret of the house, one that she
couldn't live with.  She told Aya that if she found a way out of the house,
she was going to go and find a place for herself, somewhere where she could
live with her people.  Aya and his wife decided to help the girl, and told her
that they'd find a way out of the house if she'd help them.  The girl agreed, and
for a while she worked very hard in a little hut they'd made in the attic, until
one day they managed to bring her home.  Aya's wife was a Mage, and she quickly
found out that the girl was from her race, too.  And so, the girl and her family
lived in Nantucket.  They'd never leave.

Chapter 14.

The girl was called Aya, and she'd grown up to be a very handsome woman, but
still quite girlish.  She and her daughter (named Sarah, after Aya's
stepmother) took care of Aya's father, and he was getting quite old, but he
seemed to be happy with them.  He'd even taken in Aya and Sarah's
father after their deaths, and he had him living with them too.  They lived a
very simple life, and Aya was very happy.

Chapter 15.

However, Aya wasn't happy with everything.  He had grown up to be very strong,
and he had been using his power, which was forbidden to him.  His power came from
his father, and after his death, he was never able to get a hold of his power. 
He had no idea what he was supposed to do with it.  He was quite happy with his
father, but he was unhappy with the fact that the world had been so destroyed.  He
had become a bit of a recluse, but he still kept in touch with his family.  He
even became friends with one of his great-great-grandfathers, and they
talked to each other about their Mage-race, and about the world.  Aya began to
wonder about why he had his power.  He started thinking about things he didn't
understand about life.  He wanted to know more about his Mage-race, and the world,
but he had no way of learning about the world.  He didn't know how to be a mage.

Chapter 16.

The year of 1583 AD, and Aya started wondering about his power.  For he knew
that his power was inside of him, and he was sure that he'd had it for quite some
time, but no one knew what it was.  He knew that he had the power of magic
inside of him, but what kind of magic he didn't know.  He was able to do things
that he didn't understand, things that he thought of as the result of luck or
chance.  He started thinking of himself as lucky, and a bit of a trickster.  He
knew that he couldn't be a mage, though, as the laws had been passed against it.  So
he didn't know what to do with his power, and that's when he decided to do what he
was best at, which was tell stories.  He started playing games with people, and
telling them stories to get them to think of things, and then he'd tell them
stories about how things should be.  Soon, he'd been able to turn most of his
friends into his playthings.

Chapter 17.

Aya had always been a story-teller, but he'd never been good at it.  He thought
he was very good, though, and his games and stories started to get people's
attention, and their attention turned to the games.  Aya played with them for a
while, but then he realized he'd never been good at playing games.  He'd been a
bad story-teller, and was very interested in playing games.  So, when the people
found out they'd started paying him to play with them.  It became a thing, and the
Mage-race started paying him to play, and they asked him to tell them stories, and
that's when he decided to become a story-teller.  Aya had gotten very good at
this, and he'd started getting rich.  However, one day, Aya was asked to tell a story
of the people who made the world.  He refused to do so, but the people just
wouldn't leave him alone, and they eventually told Aya that if he didn't tell
them the story they'd go to the Mage-race, and tell them that he had failed in
his story-telling, and that he was a bad story-teller, and that he wasn't good at
all.  So, Aya reluctantly agreed, and told them the story of how the world came to
be.

Chapter 18.

He'd had a great deal of success at this, and a lot of people started to listen
to his stories.  However, the stories were quite short, and people got bored with
them quickly.  It was because of this that he decided to start using the stories
to lead people to things he wanted them to learn.  For he'd figured out that it
took people a long time to learn things, and that they'd keep coming back to him
for more, if he told them stories about things they'd want to learn about.  So, he
started telling people about the stories that he wanted them to read, or study.

Chapter 19.

Aya had become very good at this, and had learned a great deal about a wide
variety of topics.  One day, he came across a man named Socrates, and Socrates
listened to Aya's stories very closely.  They didn't always agree, but in a
way, Aya seemed to know what he was talking about, and his stories seemed
completely honest.  Socrates had a very different way of thinking, and his stories
always followed a pattern, but were always different, and very interesting.  Aya
was quite enthused with Socrates, and he decided to take Socrates to the people.
He went to the village, and told the people that Socrates was a great man, and
that everyone should go to hear him talk about things.  Soon, everyone was
listening to Socrates talk, and the people loved him.  Socrates realized he'd
found something truly great, and he was quite humbled.  He stayed in Athens for a
while, and started to tell stories, and Aya started to come to him.  They'd work
together, and Aya would tell Socrates a story, and then he'd follow it up by
telling him a story about how it should be.  Socrates came to understand and
appreciate the importance of stories, and the power that they had.  They were the
most important things in the world, and Aya was quite right.

Chapter 20.

Aya had been telling people about many things for a very long time, and he
kept finding himself telling people about the stories he knew they'd want to know
about.  He'd heard people were reading about the world, and he knew that they
were finding the true stories, and that's what Aya decided to do.  He wanted to
have an entire library, and he started one.  He'd found a way to send his stories
to anyone who wanted to hear them.  Aya wrote the stories himself, and told the
people that he'd written them, and that he was just telling them stories about what
the stories had to say.  His stories were very interesting, and quite
entertaining.  He knew that he'd made it into the books of the world, and he was
very proud.

Chapter 21.

However, Aya's friends weren't pleased with the whole idea, and one day they
told him that it would be best if he stopped telling stories.  Aya took this
seriously, and he told the people about his stories.  He realized that he'd
failed, and had started telling lies.  He began to feel ashamed of himself, and
wanted to stop talking about stories.  He did try, but he was quite good at
making people believe him, so he just kept going.  He went on his way, but he
didn't go far.  He'd told people that he was telling the stories he was making up,
and they'd believed him.  They'd been talking to him, and Aya knew that they
weren't telling him the true stories.  He knew that they'd be coming back to him
for more stories, and he knew he'd have to tell the true stories in the end.
When the people came to him again, Aya did not want to talk to them.  He still
didn't believe he'd be telling lies, and that's why he was very happy when they
started telling the stories he'd made up.  He realized that this was only
beginning, and he knew that he had to stop lying.  So, when the people had all
talked to him about his stories, Aya decided to write about them, and about how to
create the perfect world.  He also wrote about himself, because he was a story-teller
himself.  Aya was quite proud of himself for writing about the stories, and he
thought about making up another story that would tell about his world.  Aya wrote
a story in which people came to him, and they were all happy to hear his stories,
and to learn about them.  He thought of a name for his new story, and called it
the World Story.  It was the story he'd been telling for many years, and which
many people had come to him to learn, and which he'd told them he was just
telling stories about.

Chapter 22.

Aya had just finished writing the story he wanted to write, and he started
telling the story to the people.  It was a long story, and quite interesting, and
Aya had gotten quite popular, and was always being told stories.  He thought the
story was complete, and decided to tell it again.  He realized that he'd never
told the story in the first place, and the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:04
