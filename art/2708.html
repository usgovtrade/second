#### Taling Chan

Taling Chan, about 1km south of the town centre, is one of Phuket's oldest communities, its inhabitants settling here in the late 18th century.

1Sights & Activities

Taling Chan (สะพรับอาคาร) is considered by Thais to be one of the country's most important _meu·ang_ (city pillar, literally 'mother house'), as several important monuments were built here. Many of the town's oldest buildings were built by Chinese and Indian traders who came to Phuket in the late 19th century. Most were wealthy men, who lived in style in vast wooden mansions – several are now used as _chow lair_ (Chinese restaurants).

It was thought the town would be devastated when the tsunami struck, but the buildings escaped relatively unscathed. Today most residents live in modest homes, though the area still has a colonial-era air.

Taling Chan Floating MarketMARKET

(สะพรับอาคารทะเล ตะเกนตราชัน, Hat Racha Noi;  h6-11am Sat)

This popular floating market sees hundreds of vendors selling everything from fish and fruit to cheap clothes. It's a photogenic place and good fun for wandering and people-watching.

4Sleeping & Eating

The following guesthouses are around the corner from the boat pier. Many of the best dining experiences are down-at-heel streets off Th Thepkasatri, between the Hat Racha Noi and Hat Rin neighbourhoods.

The well-loved wooden rooms at this historic mansion are a few hundred baht cheaper than the surrounding hotels, but it's worth considering because of the charming host. Note that there is no air-con.

6Drinking & Nightlife

There are a few places for beer and cocktails.

### Wreck Diving & Snorkelling off Phuket

For those looking for the scuba experience but without the effort of learning how to dive or getting certified, it's now possible to combine the wondrousness of diving with the wonders of snorkelling. Phuket has a plethora of amazing dive sites for novices, intermediates and experts, some of which are just offshore from Phuket.

Snorkelling and diving are also popular activities along the more remote parts of the coastline. And on some of these trips you can snorkel from the safety of a cruise ship.

Several dive centres run snorkelling trips from Phuket and nearby islands for around 1500B to 2000B for a day trip.
