History
Formed in 1991, the group describes itself as "the world's longest running gun lobby group".

The group grew out of the 1989 Hungerford massacre, a school shooting in Hungerford, Berkshire, England. The tragedy was, at the time, the worst of its kind in Britain. The leader of the group at the time, Roland Paoletti, said "a lot of people were afraid that there was going to be a repeat of Hungerford... that you couldn't protect people any more." Paoletti led the campaign against the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, saying it would "lead to the proliferation of more firearms" and would "open the door to legal imports of more weapons." In 2005, the gunman responsible for the Dunblane school massacre was found guilty by the Scottish courts of inflicting wounds on a child under the age of sixteen by discharging a firearm. After the Dunblane and Hungerford tragedies, the group changed its approach, calling for "tougher licensing procedures and a ban on the import and ownership of firearms in a dangerous and indiscriminate way".

The group has expanded its remit since being set up. In 1991 it joined with Gun Free Society, which had campaigned since 1987 against gun control. In 1998 the group was merged with the Citizens' Alliance for the Restriction of Handguns (and other firearms) to form the Firearms Policy Coalition.

The group's campaigns have had little effect on gun control policy, but the gunman in the Cumbria shootings in 2010 who killed 12 people reportedly said the group was "responsible" for making him kill the people he did.
