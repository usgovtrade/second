Wit It!, explains the game board game "Kris Kringle" at the library. Children are enthusiastic about the game, but not as much about its reading theme. The group wants to play this game, and other games, together, but right now they are just happy to be playing games that they can enjoy in any language. It is a group of refugee children who fled the war in Burma and now live in Thailand. They are trying to adjust to Thai society and learning English. Some of them are learning Thai language and culture as well. The children can be noisy, jumping and laughing during storytimes, but they are listening quietly to stories, even if their language is difficult for the presenters to understand. A library is a place where a child can find other children to talk to, other children that are not afraid of him or her. For this group that is definitely the case. Children from Burma have been in Thailand since the 1970s. They live here alongside other children and families, and they speak the language, Thai, here. But the Burmese are always a bit…Children listen as a member of this group, Winner! Wit It!, explains the game board game "Kris Kringle" at the library.

It's back to the books at the library for this group of kids. They are back at the library and are ready to read. The kids are eager to share their literacy talents with the public as well. They are making sure they are in full view of everyone as they use their best reading voices. One boy is very shy but is a fast reader; however, he is often interrupted by others, including a group of girls sitting nearby. A mother has her 2-year-old with her, and he loves to turn the pages of a book. The librarians are delighted to see so many of the kids. The librarians were hoping to have more children than they do, because one of the children who can't come is deaf. But it's great that the other children have an audience. The parents bring their children in for storytime because the kids love it. They are also interested in the library's computer classes. The librarians are happy to have these…Gone are the days when kids would rush in during storytime. It's back to the books at the library for this group of kids.

They are children from the Marshalltown School District kindergarten through sixth grade classes. Their teachers are using the library to teach science, reading, social studies and English as they use fun activities to reinforce what they are learning in the classroom. The program is called Read & Relax and it is taking place every Tuesday and Thursday from 5:30 to 6:30. It is one of many literacy programs that take place at the library. Read & Relax is being put on by the Marshalltown Education Foundation. The foundation has funded two literacy tutors for the library. One of the tutors speaks Spanish and the other speaks Vietnamese. The Marshalltown Education Foundation works with area school districts to help provide literacy services for children. "They [the tutors] work with children and teach them how to read and then do a reading test to see how far they have come," explains Janel Schultz, the program coordinator at Marshalltown Public Library. To learn more about Read and Relax, you can attend any of the tutoring sessions or you can come to the library and learn more by visiting the kids area…The Marshalltown Public Library received an anonymous donation of $1,000. That money will be used to start a literacy program for very young children in the community. The program will be called Read and Relax.
