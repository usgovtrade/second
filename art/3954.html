U.S. Geological Survey, September 9, 2012

When scientists first studied bottlenose dolphins, they documented individual and social behaviors, distinguishing each animal by its unique vocalization. The scientific literature contains hundreds of articles naming hundreds of bottlenose dolphin individuals. It's a natural part of scientists' daily work, and it has been well established for several decades.

A new paper shows that the names of bottlenose dolphins – like the names of people – vary according to location. The study is part of ongoing research comparing the social and physical environments of two geographically separated regions of the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, USA. This time we took names into account.

The research team's preliminary conclusion is that animals in the southern region of the Indian River Lagoon have "better names" than those in the northern region. Why? One could speculate that the social dynamics in the different locations might be different, although there is no way of knowing for sure. In addition, it is possible that the naming processes are different in the two areas.

For their study, scientists looked at bottlenose dolphins in the northern and southern regions of the Indian River Lagoon. We compared their social and physical environments, and found that the dolphins in the southern region are exposed to a wider variety of stimuli, as they travel more and are exposed to more variability than those in the northern region. In addition, the animals in the southern region have different ways of "name" their friends, naming them according to behavior, as they do in New York's harbor.

The number of animals named within the two regions was also compared. The northern region had only six names of its 17 animals while the southern region had only 10 names of its 26 animals. The researchers then tried to find out why.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that physical environment alone is not enough to explain why the numbers vary. Instead, there are a number of reasons: the differences in vocal repertoire, the different ways of identifying one's friends, and the different cultural perceptions of animals in the region. In short, if you want to understand the natural diversity in this world, and why some things are "better" than others, you have to consider the whole picture: physical, social, cultural and many other factors. This helps explain why a single organism like a dolphin could be named six different ways in its habitat, like it is in New York Harbor, but a dolphin in India would only be named twice.

The study was a preliminary comparison between two locations and the authors emphasize that much more research is needed. Researchers would like to learn more about how both the physical environment and the human cultures in these two regions interact with the lives of dolphins. For example, we don't know what effect, if any, the presence of human-cultivated fish in the southern Indian River Lagoon is having on dolphin social behavior and habitat use. Further studies of these and other areas in this region are needed to establish the geographic diversity of the Indian River dolphins, its impact on individual dolphin health and survival, and the interaction between dolphins and people.
