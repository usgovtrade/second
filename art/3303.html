Eat.Pray.Love. (aka Eat Pray Love) (2006)
Eat Pray Love (2006) is a mockumentary about a woman named Elizabeth Gilbert on a tour through Italy to decide between three suitors, then a movie is made about her quest. The film was a commercial success (grossing over $200 million), garnering seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actress, and a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress (though Gilbert did not win).
The movie is directed by Rob Reiner, who also wrote it with Peter Gethers.
The fictional biopic of Gilbert's search, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, is presented as a documentary that is presented in full-fledged fictional style as well as in mockumentary format, complete with the interviewees reading from cue cards and speaking in a voiceover (most likely performed by Ellen Burstyn).
Reiner, a noted "Mensch" and member of the Hollywood elite, is perhaps best known for his classic sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show.

In Eat.Pray.Love., Gilbert begins her journey with her husband (John Turturro) and three daughters leaving them in New York City, where they discuss how to tell their children the truth about his infidelity.
Heading off to Florence, Italy on a tour of The Leaning Tower of Pisa, Gilbert attends the Marriage of the Virgin Mary, where she chooses her guide, Fabrizio, to marry her. Fabrizio says he is an atheist and that he doesn't believe in marriage, but he is still willing to marry her.
Back in New York City, Gilbert is now planning to go to Sardinia for the annual Sardinian Carnival. She meets Italian filmmaker Gabriele (Tony Shalhoub) at a reading of her book. They go to Sardinia together and spend time on a beach with several men playing volleyball. She also discovers a man named Luigi (George Perrazzini), who is searching for true love and has been living in a cave for 30 years, but whom she later discovers is now living in Italy. Gilbert's daughters are upset that she is going to a cave in Sardinia, and Gilbert is surprised to learn that she is now going to spend time with the Italian cave man and his dogs, who she has come to know as her "Ding-Dongs".
Gilbert decides to remain in Sardinia with Luigi and their dogs. The local Catholic priest protests that she is still married, and threatens that she will be damned for having an affair, even though she is not Catholic herself.
Back in New York City, Gilbert's daughter says that she has been having an affair with an Italian man, and she realizes that she may have been seeing the same man as her mother.
Back in Sardinia, Gilbert falls in love with Luigi, and they are married by a judge, after first having a Catholic wedding. Luigi then invites her to walk with him through the streets of Sardinia for the first time, without any of their dogs. Later, on a secluded beach, Gilbert and Luigi kiss for the first time.
Now that she is married to Luigi, Gilbert returns home to New York City and her daughters, after spending some time at a local pet store, where she buys one of Luigi's dogs.
Her husband is shocked to see that she has arrived with a dog, but he's relieved to find out that the dog isn't his. Gilbert tells her husband that he can live with the dogs in Sardinia.
Gilbert is now divorced from Luigi, but she is still planning to go to Stromboli to visit her ex-husband, who is writing a documentary on Sardinia.
She then decides to go to New York City for three weeks to take care of her kids, during which time she plans to visit a gynecologist for a woman who has gone six months without sex, and a proctologist for a man who has been unable to have bowel movements for ten years.
After some time in New York City, Gilbert returns home to her "castle", where she is surprised to discover that Luigi is not there. Her two daughters go to see Luigi, who are upset that Gilbert is so obsessed with him, but they are even more upset when Gilbert tells them that Luigi has decided to go to Sicily to be with the man he has met there, who is a woman named Claudia, who he had met online, but who may be a man.
Gilbert finds a new man named Massimo (Dario Bandiera), and she is so happy with him that she forgets about her ex-husband and her ex-husband's new wife (both living in Sardinia), and Gilbert tells Massimo that she wants to buy a castle.
Gilbert's daughters are now upset that their mother has been spending so much time on her castle that she is neglecting them, and they are upset that Gilbert has started a relationship with Massimo.
Gilbert tells Massimo that she wants to buy a castle, but he refuses. She tells him that she wants to buy a castle, but Massimo says that she can't buy a castle because she doesn't have money.
Gilbert goes to Sicily to visit Claudia, and she realizes that she has fallen in love with her new "husband", who talks with a stammer.
At the end of the film, Gilbert decides to buy the castle, so she decides to go back to New York City.

El Viaje del Fuego (aka Spanish Fly) (2005) is a comedic Spanish-language comedy directed by Mike Cerrone, starring Cheech Marin, Tommy Davidson, Tony Plana and Freddy Rodriguez, about two con men (Marin and Davidson) who try to pull off a big job.
Cerrone co-wrote the screenplay with Rene Perez, and co-produced with James Merendino.
Cheech Marin (born Jose Ernesto Marin Vazquez), who is better known for his work in bilingual films, has a son, Jose Antonio, by his first marriage. His older brother is Cheech Marin, Jr., who has two children.
Cheech Marin is bilingual, able to speak both English and Spanish.

In El Viaje del Fuego, two Cuban ex-convicts (Marin and Davidson) are hired by Mr. Waxman (Freddy Rodriguez), a rich American looking for a way to get money quickly, to steal a load of Spanish fly (a stimulant drug used to increase the sexual appetite).
The two con men sell out Waxman and steal his money.
The Mexican Mafia attempts to extort money from Mr. Waxman, but he doesn't have anything to give. The con men's friend, a hit man named Joe "La Pistola" (Jose "Pepe" Plana), who speaks with a Spanish accent and has a tattoo of an axe, then tries to extort Waxman. The con men are unhappy that Waxman didn't give them a cut of the money they stole from him.
Waxman then gives the con men a huge amount of money as a gift, which they don't find helpful. Waxman offers them a small job, which is to recover some stolen money. The con men are then offered a job to help the police, for a small amount of money.
They agree to help the police, but on the day of the job, the police want to arrest them. They are then bailed out of jail by a judge (Tony Plana) who also helps them find a job as a hit men for a man named Pedro "Pucho" Vargas (Antonio Camilo) to recover a stolen treasure chest from drug dealers. The con men and Pucho steal the treasure.
When they try to sell the treasure, Pucho discovers that he is being blackmailed by the bad cops, who are working for Mr. Waxman. Pucho tells Waxman that the con men are working for him, and Waxman hires them to steal money from the Mexicans who own a cocaine operation.
The con men have a small job with Joe "La Pistola" to recover the money that is stolen by the Mexicans.
Pucho is also trying to extort the cocaine owner, but he has nothing to give Pucho.
Mr. Waxman gives the con men a new job, but the guy they are working for is not very nice, and they discover that Mr. Waxman and the bad cops are not very nice people, so they throw Mr. Waxman's money away.
The con men also throw away the money Pucho has stolen from the Mexicans.
The Mexican Mafia, who is led by a character named Tio Lucas (Victor Garcia), then puts a $100,000 bounty on the head of Cheech Marin, who goes into hiding.
