In the second part of the weekend’s festivities, Ska-P will throw down with the mighty Ska O.T.T. at the “Vibe of the Tribe” stage. Their music combines ska, reggae, Oi, and punk with ska punk, pop punk, and ska metal; these genre mash ups fit the vibe of the festival in a very fitting way. This band is well known for their aggressive sound, which has been adopted by bands like The Slackers and is known to incite large singalongs at its shows. You can expect to see a whole lot of that from a lot of people on the third day of the festival.

Vibe of the Tribe on Saturday will feature many of the best ska acts, including bands from New England, Boston and elsewhere in New York. These bands will set you on a path to explore some of the local music the city has to offer. At this stage, you will be able to hear plenty of new bands as well as those you love performing with more local energy and a greater degree of ease.

The following day, on Sunday, will feature the same format, but with additional bands and more ska. This will be the last day of the festival. The lineup is currently limited, so you can only imagine how many other great bands will be here. Make sure to go check them out and see who else makes the cut.

The Skalicious Ska Festival will be a great day at a great festival. You can learn more about the line up and purchase tickets for this event at www.skalicious.com. You can also follow the festival on Facebook at www.facebook.com/skaliciousfestival and follow them on Twitter @SkaliciousFestival.
