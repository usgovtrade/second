<daftykins> ah yes, when i was still in Scotland there was this one shop, the 'toy store' i think it was called, which you could only buy stuff from online and had a phone number to call and you'd get told what was going on and you'd then be directed there
<daftykins> o0 lots of effort
<OERIAS> i cant wait to see popey
<daftykins> :D
<popey> \o/
<daftykins> oh wait you're in the US
<popey> OERIAS: it's not till monday. :D
<popey> hahah
<popey> it'll be the day after my flight lands though
<OERIAS> ahh
<OERIAS> nooo
<OERIAS> please not
<OERIAS> jesus
<OERIAS> do
<OERIAS> you are coming to birmingham?
<daftykins> is that the place with the weirdly built church with a huge dome
<daftykins> i'll just get it out of storage for you :P
<OERIAS> i am in the city centre
<OERIAS> ive already made a few friends
<OERIAS> theres a really nice bar
<OERIAS> just off the city centre
<OERIAS> its very chill
<OERIAS> i feel like i am going to be a permanent fixture in birmingham
<daftykins> :D
<daftykins> maybe i'll see you there :)
<OERIAS> and ive found a house!
<OERIAS> very close to all of the tourist attractions
<daftykins> \o/
<OERIAS> it is very central, everything is less than half an hour away
<OERIAS> from the airport
<daftykins> how's it feel to be in a country which has only 'newly' won its independence?
<daftykins> oh my, you've seen the olde England :P
<daftykins> not very much change really in what's there, just like the USA
<OERIAS> what do you mean?
<OERIAS> newely*
<daftykins> the US being the "New World"
<daftykins> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World
<OERIAS> ah, i see
<OERIAS> is there much more to there?
<OERIAS> have they explored other planets?
<daftykins> there's much more, but it's a different continent
<OERIAS> im very excited, this is my first time in europe
<OERIAS> i was living in south america for a while
<OERIAS> south America is a lot different from Europe
<OERIAS> the people are all weird
<OERIAS> south americans
<daftykins> :D
<daftykins> you mean like a different species of monkey?
<OERIAS> im not racist
<OERIAS> but South America has some strange people
<OERIAS> the people in europe are the most beautiful
<OERIAS> and smart
<daftykins> nah that's 'the west'
<daftykins> :D
<OERIAS> smart and beautiful women in europe are rare though
<OERIAS> I know
<daftykins> well, the women you describe are the American ladies
<OERIAS> im talking about british and french women
<daftykins> but you mean your ex
<OERIAS> she is american
<OERIAS> but she has lived in europe
<OERIAS> she had bad experiences with it
<OERIAS> i could visit America anytime i like
<OERIAS> i was so surprised that most people speak English
<OERIAS> although i was told that not all parts of America speak English
<daftykins> it's not that you're not allowed to, but i find getting around without some fluency in the local tongue tends to make you look quite odd (which i used to be like before i learned it)
<OERIAS> i know, i found it difficult too
<OERIAS> when i went to america i found it difficult to make friends
<daftykins> ah, perhaps that was why then
<OERIAS> the only reason i went to America was to escape britain
<OERIAS> it was all too much for me
<daftykins> ah, you found a better place?
<OERIAS> im in a much better place, and i love my job
<daftykins> a bit of a double life, not sure that's entirely healthy
<OERIAS> it is all better for me now
<OERIAS> im really happy now
<daftykins> cool, good to hear :)
<OERIAS> i have a house in the center of the city with all of the nightlife nearby
<OERIAS> all of the beautiful women are within reach
<OERIAS> not to mention the good food
<daftykins> :D
<daftykins> what does it come with?
<OERIAS> this house
<OERIAS> its in a really nice area
<OERIAS> just the house is a bit old
<OERIAS> and needs a bit of tlc
<OERIAS> i just bought a lot of paint for it
<OERIAS> what do you do daftykins?
<daftykins> me? i don't like to talk about it. nevermind.
<OERIAS> why not?
<OERIAS> dont like to talk about it?
<daftykins> nah, i don't really want to go into it
<OERIAS> i see
<daftykins> if you'd rather not know, don't bother me for it :)
<OERIAS> no one likes to be bothered
<OERIAS> my friend
<OERIAS> shes at the hospital
<daftykins> you could be talking to a brick wall for all we know
<daftykins> which one is that?
<OERIAS> shes at the hospital
<daftykins> is she your girlfriend?
<OERIAS> my friend
<OERIAS> not my girlfriend
<daftykins> ah, right
<daftykins> so maybe i should start worrying :>
<OERIAS> she is sick
<OERIAS> and being at the hospital is the only thing shes doing
<daftykins> ah right, she's waiting on a transplant?
<OERIAS> im sorry
<OERIAS> no
<OERIAS> she will recover from her illness
<OERIAS> its cancer related
<OERIAS> her health has got worse recently
<OERIAS> then i noticed she stopped eating
<daftykins> ah, sorry to hear that
<OERIAS> im trying to help her out because shes my friend and i love her
<daftykins> aww so she has cancer? wow
<OERIAS> she has cancer but not like what the NHS think
<OERIAS> they want to operate on her
<OERIAS> thats why she is in the hospital
<OERIAS> if you see her ill let you know shes recovering
<daftykins> i believe there are some pretty nasty and dangerous types that don't even warrant such treatment, you know?
<OERIAS> cancer treatment is expensive in britain, they dont know how to treat cancer properly
<OERIAS> no more than the NHS
<OERIAS> my friend is dying
<daftykins> haha
<OERIAS> ive already lost a friend to cancer
<OERIAS> this cancer treatment is expensive and it does not cure the disease
<OERIAS> if shes not careful
<OERIAS> she will die
<OERIAS> what about this house in the center of the city?
<daftykins> ah that's not great
<daftykins> :/
<daftykins> sorry to hear that
<OERIAS> im sorry
<OERIAS> she wont die
<OERIAS> her health is bad but she will survive
<daftykins> ok i'm not a medical professional, so i won't know what's best for her
<daftykins> but i'd say she</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:30
