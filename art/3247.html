He said, "We've got to get him, we've got to do it for the kids, we've got to do it for the country. The Democrats in the last four years have trashed the country."



Paul Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said the congressman has "always agreed that our tax code should have a lower rate for everyone and that is part of our goal." She didn't directly answer a question about Trump's plan, however.



Trump's proposal to eliminate most of the individual deductions is a nonstarter for the House. Republicans have already backed off a campaign promise to repeal the state and local tax deduction.



It may not be as simple as killing the deduction, though. The government needs some revenue, and eliminating nearly every other deduction means Congress will need to find new revenue sources.



It also poses a problem in that voters like deductions, too.



Trump has promised "massive tax reform" for years and has been expected to propose a 10-point plan this year, but his proposal has been very sparse. He was vague about how he'd pay for it, and his staff even struggled to describe what the cuts would look like.



While Trump has been calling for his plan to be revenue neutral, many outside analysts believe it is likely to be revenue positive.



Republicans are considering adding $1.5 trillion in deficit spending on the plan that would need Democratic votes in the Senate to pass. The plan would also need approval from at least some moderate Democrats who voted for the GOP tax cuts.



In addition to lowering tax rates, Trump has also said he wants to end special breaks to allow tax rates to change for people who fall into certain income groups. These "brackets" were enacted in 2013 to allow people making more than $250,000 a year to keep their rate low, instead of raising it as high as 35 percent for those making more than $400,000.
