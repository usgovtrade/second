“I can imagine her as an older woman and she’s really lovely.”

According to the Mirror, the actress, who is now married to Prince Andrew, gave her parents credit for raising her.

“I’m very lucky and proud of my parents. My father is a retired army officer and my mother is a former teacher, so they both have a good understanding of what it is to deal with a life in the spotlight. I am very grateful that they have both been able to be there for me at all times. They may not have done much for a while, but we all got through it together. I wouldn’t be here today without them.”

A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on whether the prince had sought counsel from a mental health expert.

The palace’s communications office issued a statement claiming that there are “tensions surrounding the Duchess of Cambridge’s ongoing role” as an ambassador for various charities.

“We understand those concerns but these are outweighed by the benefits to be gained from supporting her continued engagement with her own charities.”

In 2015, the prince, who has four children with his ex-wife, visited the Paddington Hospital to see for himself the work being carried out by the charity which he has funded.

The visit came at the same time that the National Health Service was beginning to look at ways to reform what was then a controversial waiting-list policy that had seen hundreds of people die after their treatment was delayed.

In a statement, Camilla’s office said: “The prince and the duchess met with staff and patients at Paddington’s specialist breast unit. The duchess was greatly moved by the courage and spirit of the patients and staff there.

“Prince Harry and Meghan have also visited the Meningitis Now charity to see their work first hand and have made generous donations to The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.”

While the duchess’s work with Meningitis Now has faced scrutiny, it is the first charity to be featured in the prince’s new book with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge.

In an interview published in the Times this week, Prince Harry revealed that he had spoken to his brother about his struggles with mental health.

“He was having panic attacks and couldn’t leave the house without crawling out of the window and running across the roof.”

The royal family recently came under fire for its failure to release any official statement or any photo of the Duchess of Cambridge following the birth of her and Prince Harry’s son last April.

At the time, Kensington Palace simply said: “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce the birth of their baby boy.”
