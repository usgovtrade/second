Instead 
of a picture-perfect vacation on the beach, Gail 
was now watching her husband being tossed, 
one piece at a time, into the Atlantic Ocean. 
Her story took the wind out of her sails, and she 
began to drown in despair. In her grief, and with 
few coping skills, she turned to drinking and 
became addicted to alcohol. She found solace in 
drinking vodka straight from the bottle. She had 
once been a party girl, who had gotten so drunk 
at a party one night that she threw up in a 
friend's new car.
As this was going on, Michael was in deep 
distress himself. Desperate to get away from his 
wife and her drinking, he joined the navy to 
fight the war on drugs. He flew helicopters, 
trained others, and was eventually commissioned 
as an officer. This gave him more of a mission, 
one that he could take pride in doing. He felt that 
he was doing something positive, taking care of 
the country. Gail was not content with this and 
disapproved, as she could not bear to have her 
husband away from home. 
After 18 years of marriage, Michael could no 
longer bear to be around Gail and her drinking. 
Not wanting to leave her, he just put on a happy 
face, though he was really in trouble. His wife 
wanted him to go to war with the alcohol and 
Michael was trapped in a war of attrition, and 
she was getting the upper hand. In April 1992, 
he sought treatment for a drinking problem, at 
the Navy's drug abuse facility. Within weeks, he 
was back on the road, assigned to fly again. He 
and Gail were living in a condo in North Carolina, 
and were not doing so well. With Gail out of work, 
she was resorting to other ways of taking care of 
herself. At one point, she went to a bar and 
drank, and when she did, Michael was waiting for 
her and dragged her home by her feet. Gail's 
wonderful vacation turned into a nightmare. 
Michael's drinking continued, and he was also 
in trouble. Michael was in a world of his own, and 
Gail was not a welcome presence. She went back 
to work, and also began to drink and get into 
more trouble. Life for both of them was spinning 
out of control. 
Then, the nightmare began to turn into a 
nightmare for Gail, and for Michael. Gail was 
finally given a choice between going to jail, or 
rehab. So she entered rehab. Her parents paid for 
it. She got a one-year sentence, in August 1992. 
Michael got a choice as well, which was not a 
choice at all. He could not cope with the 
thought of losing his wife. He would make the 
best of his situation, or so he thought. He thought 
it would be okay to drink in his own home. 
Little did he know. For, on September 18, 1992, 
his wife left him for the last time. To avoid going 
to jail for beating his wife, Michael had to enlist 
the help of Gail's parents to pay for her treatment. 
Gail stayed in rehab for 10 months. When she 
got out, she was clean and sober, but her father 
would not let her see Michael. Her father just 
did not want her to see her husband, for he 
figured she would drink again. Michael was 
left to cope on his own, with a wife gone, a home 
forever empty, and no wife or home to go to. The 
end of a life with the love of his life. 
Michael spent a year in the house that he had 
lived in for almost 30 years, on the same street 
where he had grown up. He had some visitors, 
but he was not in the mood for socializing. He 
was not in the mood to be anywhere but at home. 
It was here that he suffered a terrible loss: His 
dog Max, who had been with him since he was a 
young boy. As far as Michael was concerned, Max 
was family. At times, Michael became belligerent 
with a few of his visitors. Gail once called the 
police because he and another friend were 
having an argument. Things were going wrong, 
and the end was fast approaching. The world 
would never be the same. 
On July 14, 1993, the police were called to 
help Michael, who was distraught and needed 
help. The police helped him, as they could see 
how close he was to the end. When Michael was 
arrested, he told the police that he was going 
to kill himself. On July 16, Michael was found 
dead of carbon monoxide poisoning. He had tied a 
pillowcase around his neck and carbon monoxide 
was being pumped into his house through the 
electrical system. In the process of dying, he was 
helping the police make a murder case. 
Gail was back in town, and was at the police 
station when she got the news that Michael was 
dead. All that she wanted was for him to be 
alive, but it was too late. She could not help him, 
and there was nothing she could do. The most 
positive thing she could say is that he was 
happy, and that was by his choice. This was his 
decision. He was doing the right thing, not 
taking his life, but he knew he would have to do 
it one day. 
Gail was the first wife to be murdered by her 
spouse, and the last one. It is the last wife who is 
usually murdered, while the first wives simply 
leave the relationship. However, many times, the 
couple will have children together, and the 
children will think it is their fault that the 
parents are separated, or the grandparents are 
fighting. It can all get very confusing, and 
sometimes it ends in murder. The murder, or 
suicide, is usually the husband's fault, and he 
does it for his own good. He wants the peace of 
the grave, not a life in the custody battle with his 
in-laws. It is as though his children's lives are 
too valuable to take, so he ends it all himself. 
What can you do to protect yourself from a 
suicidal spouse? First, keep away from the 
drinking of spouses and drinking in general. 
Secondly, keep the weapon out of reach and do not 
let him get drunk. Drinking puts him at risk, but 
not being drunk saves you from some trouble. 
You need to look him straight in the eye, and you 
need to look straight into his eyes as well. 
Always keep a small mirror in your purse, so 
that you can peer into it when things go wrong. 
In a world where we live in crisis, this is not 
much more than common sense. He needs to 
watch his eyes, and watch what he is doing, and 
his hands. If he is breathing in the odor of 
alcohol, it is a good bet that he is planning to 
take his life. The police are trained to look for 
this, but you must do so, too. Watch him as he 
does his business, how he carries himself, the 
color of his face, and the look in his eyes. You 
need to keep an eye on him, and you must do so 
if he is intent on committing suicide. And he is 
not going to be able to talk about anything that 
happened to him, and he is not going to talk about 
anything that happened to him, ever. This is 
normal for a person in crisis. 
Remember that alcoholism is not the same as 
being lazy, not being able to do anything, and 
not caring. A person with a drinking problem is</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:10
