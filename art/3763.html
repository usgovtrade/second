We could not have asked for a better venue for our wedding. Every member of staff was friendly, professional, and easy to work with. The venue was perfect for us. It was a little small but we easily turned that space into our own party with all of the great decorations, tables and fun ideas. Our guests had a great time and so did we! The food was great and the venue offered a nice amount of seating. Even the parking lot had some fun decor to add to the fun we had.
