Kill or Be Killed (released as Killing Floor in North America) is a 2005 South Korean crime film written and directed by Ryu Seung-wan.

Plot
The movie begins with a robbery at a convenience store. A man with no eyes, who calls himself "Eyes", is found on the road after he was run over by a car. It's revealed later in the film that this man is the owner of a local dojo, and used to be a very honorable police officer. The current police chief and the dojo owner were once lovers, but a tragic accident resulted in her death, and the two split up after that.
