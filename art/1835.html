## BLACK-EYED PEA AND BEET HUMMUS

MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS (240 ML) • SERVING SIZE: ¼ CUP (60 G)

Hummus is one of the easiest-to-prepare vegan dips. This recipe gives it a rich, creamy texture and delicious flavors thanks to the combination of beets and black-eyed peas.

1 medium beet, scrubbed and finely grated

1 cup (235 ml) water

¼ cup (30 g) raw cashews, soaked for 1 hour or overnight and drained

2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

2 Tbsp tahini

1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice

1 tsp ground cumin

½ tsp garlic powder

½ tsp ground cinnamon

½ tsp smoked paprika

Pinch of cayenne pepper

3 Tbsp nonfat plain yogurt

½ cup (75 g) cooked and drained black-eyed peas

1 tsp nutritional yeast flakes

1 tsp dried parsley flakes

2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the grated beet, water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook until the beets are tender and the water has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.

2. Place the cashews, 2 Tbsp of the olive oil, tahini, and lemon juice in a food processor. Pulse several times until smooth and combined. Add the cumin, garlic powder, cinnamon, smoked paprika, and cayenne and pulse until combined.

3. While the beet mixture cools, whisk together the yogurt, black-eyed peas, and nutritional yeast. Combine this with the beet mixture. Pour into a shallow bowl or small serving dish, and drizzle with additional olive oil and cilantro. Serve immediately.

VARIATION

For a richer dip, skip the black-eyed peas and use some cooked garbanzo beans, cooked mashed potatoes, cooked lentils, or cooked white beans in place of the black-eyed peas.
