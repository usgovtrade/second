On sale November 13 • 32 pg, FC, $2.99 US • RATED T

Sides are chosen in the explosive finale of "Fear Itself." Injustice must come to an end—but not yet!

The first year of the New 52 is here! Welcome to comics' boldest start since the dawn of the modern age. In the first year of DC YOU, anything can happen.

Check out the thrilling first year of the New 52 in DC's most amazing adventure yet! These are the comics that are changing everything in comics for a whole new generation of fans! The future of DC Comics begins now!

The year is now two years old. Where do we stand? What have we accomplished? Where do we go from here? These are the questions you ask when it comes to celebrating an anniversary.

And now, a word from your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...

What is my favorite thing? Is it a silly question? Probably... I mean, it's the same as it was last week, and the week before, and the week before that! What are you, an alien? You know, when I said that my favorite thing was my favorite thing, I thought that would settle the debate! But now that I've seen what this column's about, I don't really know... well, to tell you the truth, I don't even know how you go about picking one thing that you like best!

I mean, some days I just like being Spider-Man. Other days, I like learning about my new friends from out of town. Other days, I like working on the Daily Bugle. Other days, I like doing whatever it is that I'm doing. That's what being Spider-Man is all about, after all—and what it really means to me is that there isn't one thing I like the best. That's why I keep it all going all the time! That's why I don't let one day pass without...

Wait, you're writing a column? Huh? What? No! Don't tell me! Don't tell me that I just gave you an ending! There's still time! I just need to talk to the readers... or maybe I'll just say it again!

I guess I'll just use this last paragraph to explain one more thing. I can keep up this act for as long as you like, but if you're looking for something that's just one thing, well... I'm sorry, but you've come to the wrong column.
