Various types of cameras are known. Generally, film-based cameras utilize roll film cartridges in which the leading end of the film strip can be wound up in the cartridge during the first-exposure and re-exposed at the moment that the second-exposure is to be made. In the former instance, when the film cartridge is inserted into the camera, the cartridge spool may drive an internal sprocket or the like for example, so that by suitable rotation, a second-exposure on the exposed portion of the film is made.
A wide variety of devices are known in which a movable holding device for the film is released after being drawn out and thus moved into the light beam of the first-exposure position. Generally, a mechanical latching device is used. In this respect it is to be noted that there are different types of sprocket drives in the known cameras, as, for example, the so-called shutter sprocket and a separate film wind-up sprocket which may or may not be linked to a movement of the shutter, depending on the manufacturer. Thus, the movable holding device for the film strip is released, when the film is rewound so that the second-exposure can take place.
In accordance with the general state of the art, an exposed film strip must be rewound inside the cartridge until the leading end of the film strip is again within reach of the holding device for the film strip. There may be a small space within the cartridge, so that the latter can be rewound without difficulty. However, when the film strip is in position within the camera, it may happen that no sufficient space for rewinding will be present in the cartridge. Generally, due to mechanical or physical reasons, the space for the rewinding of the cartridge may be insufficient. If such a case should arise, the film holder can not be returned to its initial position, so that the camera cannot be opened or emptied.
A film cartridge according to the present invention includes a cartridge main body and a film holder. The film holder is adapted for releasably holding a film and has an outer configuration adapted to mate with the cartridge main body to form an enclosure which retains a film cartridge assembly comprising the cartridge main body and the film holder.
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention, the cartridge main body has two apertures to accept a cartridge latch having a movable pin. The film holder has a film carrier and a film strip exit slot that is aligned with an aperture in the cartridge main body when the cartridge latch is inserted in the cartridge main body. The film holder further includes a light exposure cover to selectively expose the film strip. The film holder further includes an aperture for receiving the movable pin in alignment with the apertures of the cartridge latch. The aperture is of sufficient size to prevent the pin from entering the aperture when inserted.
A further aspect of the invention provides a camera assembly comprising a film cartridge and a camera. The film cartridge includes a cartridge main body and a film holder. The cartridge main body has apertures to accept a cartridge latch having a movable pin. The film holder has a film carrier and a film strip exit slot that is aligned with an aperture in the cartridge main body when the cartridge latch is inserted in the cartridge main body. The film holder further includes a light exposure cover to selectively expose the film strip. The film holder further includes an aperture for receiving the movable pin in alignment with the apertures of the cartridge latch. The aperture is of sufficient size to prevent the pin from entering the aperture when inserted. The camera includes a first aperture to receive the film carrier and a second aperture to receive the movable pin. The camera includes a camera shutter that is coupled to the movable pin. The camera includes a camera shutter that is coupled to the movable pin.
Another aspect of the invention provides a method for retaining a film strip in a holder for use in a camera. The method includes the steps of positioning a film carrier within an enclosure and aligning an aperture in the film carrier with a film strip exit slot in the holder, inserting a movable pin into a pin aperture of the film carrier to secure the film strip to the film carrier and subsequently capturing the movable pin in a camera shutter.
Yet another aspect of the invention provides a method for operating a camera having a film cartridge with a film holder positioned therein. The method includes the steps of aligning a film strip exit slot in the film holder with an aperture in the film cartridge, inserting a movable pin into a pin aperture of the film holder, aligning a light exposure aperture in the film holder with a light exposure slot in the film cartridge and exposing an image on the film strip on the film carrier in accordance with a camera shutter actuation.
The foregoing and other aspects of the invention which will become apparent as the detailed description proceeds are achieved by means of a film cartridge including a film holder. The film holder is adapted for releasably holding a film strip. The film holder has an outer configuration adapted to mate with the cartridge main body to form an enclosure which retains a film cartridge assembly comprising the cartridge main body and the film holder. A film holder aperture is positioned in a film carrier assembly to receive the film strip.
The film holder has an aperture for receiving a movable pin in alignment with an aperture in the cartridge latch. The aperture is of sufficient size to prevent the pin from entering the aperture when inserted.
These and other aspects of the invention are described in more detail below.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:34:30
