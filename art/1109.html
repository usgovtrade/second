Aadhaar for Income Tax Returns
The government is making sure that you are complying with the income tax laws. Now, they want proof! The Income Tax Department has announced that if you don't link your Aadhaar number to your income tax return by 31st July, it will assume that you are not eligible for a refund and you may not receive it.
In a press release, the IT department said that a person needs to give their Aadhaar number for various types of processing such as refund processing, audit proceedings, rectification of errors and updating details. A taxpayer can link his Aadhaar number to income tax returns either by downloading it from the e-filing portal or directly via the SMS option on the website. The last date to link your Aadhaar number is 31st July.

While people have different views on Aadhaar, but one cannot deny its importance and usefulness especially in India where there's a huge population and people are not used to government-to-government transactions. Aadhaar is also used to identify people in banks, in pension schemes and in various other cases.
It's important to note here that you can't file your ITRs, if you don't submit your Aadhaar number. This will affect your tax refund. Even if you are not due a refund, you will have to undergo the cumbersome process of proving your identity, in order to receive a cheque or an electronic transfer to your bank account.
All the best!
