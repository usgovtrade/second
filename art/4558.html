The purpose of this Notice is to publish a Draft Program Solicitation and Request for Proposals (Draft RFP), which establishes programmatic procedures and general guidelines for review and selection of qualified firms to provide programmatic support to State programs that conduct studies, reviews, or consultations and to provide data analysis, design of experiments, modeling, review of plans, evaluation of progress reports, and related technical assistance to the State or local governments.

Consortium of U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Housing and Urban Development to study, model, and forecast effects of climate change on agriculture, forestry, and the built environment. As part of this work, the Climate Change Impacts and Incentives Program will develop a new Web-based Climate Impact Tool. This Web-based Climate Impact Tool (CCIT) will help decisionmakers identify and understand the climate change impacts of the most commonly used building practices. The tool will combine climate impact models with energy modeling and financial analysis to assist decision-makers in the adoption of climate-friendly building practices and decisions. This tool will be developed to include multiple locations across the country to account for varying climatic conditions.
