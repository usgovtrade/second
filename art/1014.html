Details
================================================================
Apache Tomcat versions 5.5.35 and higher have a new feature for managing
password-related security policy. This feature is enabled by default on
the standard installation. It does not need to be enabled or
administrators have to set the password policy themselves.
By default, the password policy is set to use the same setting as the
application server. A server may have a different password policy.
This vulnerability allows exploitation of this feature without having
to crack any passwords.
CVSS 3.0 base score: 6.4
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:P/RC:C)
