Plot
Teddy Montgomery (Christopher Jackson), who recently graduated from college, moves in with his sister Lisa (Marisa Tomei) and her family after a stint in the Army.  In this film, most of the women's storylines converge at the house's garage.  Teddy is gay, but his sister and her family don't know.  Lisa's brother, Danny (Lochlyn Munro), wants to tell her but he is afraid she will reject him if she finds out.

Lisa starts a relationship with Teddy but is forced to end it when her sister's ex-husband shows up and starts acting weird around Teddy. Lisa breaks up with Teddy and accepts the fact that she has feelings for her ex-husband and begins a new relationship with him. This infuriates Teddy as he starts to think that Lisa only wants him for his money and his house.

Lisa's daughter Ally (Natasha Lyonne) starts a relationship with a girl named Jenna. Ally's mother thinks it's the best thing for her and encourages Ally to give her relationship with Jenna a chance. Teddy tells her that her relationship with her ex is not a good one. She then quits hanging out with her father and she starts to hang out with Teddy and his friends, who are all male.

After Ally is raped, she runs into Jenna. Her father tells her to keep it a secret, so she stops hanging out with Jenna. Teddy and Ally start a relationship but are caught by a neighbor, Teddy's brother Danny, so they can't go to the police about the rape. Instead, he talks to a female lawyer to get Ally out of the situation. Teddy doesn't find out that Ally was raped for two years. Teddy and Ally break up and Teddy dates several other girls but he doesn't find what he is looking for.

The women try to get Danny to talk about what happened with them. He tells Ally that he will help her, even though the law is against it. Teddy and Ally grow closer and Teddy tells her he is in love with her. Teddy tells her everything that has happened. The police find out that Danny was the one who raped Ally and they put him in jail. He is still convicted of the rape and sentenced to twelve years in prison.

Ally and Teddy get back together. They are both starting to grow feelings for each other and they decide to wait to kiss until they have fallen in love, since they are both afraid of getting hurt. Teddy's father (William Fichtner) tells him that he should not stay with his sister, especially after he cheats on her. Teddy tells Ally that he loves her. Teddy's ex-wife (Jenna Malone) and her boyfriend try to stop Teddy from leaving his sister's house. They break into the house and steal Teddy's stuff and Teddy's father comes in as the intruder. Teddy breaks up with Ally but then he realizes he is the only one she needs.

Teddy is on trial in court. The jury is not convinced because of the witness's past.  Before the verdict is passed, Teddy's best friend runs up to him and states that he was the one that raped Ally. Teddy is then sent to jail for a year. 

The film ends when Ally picks up Teddy at the airport after he is released.  He kisses her and gives her a pair of keys to his house and his heart.  Teddy returns home and tells Lisa that he loves her, and kisses her for the first time.
