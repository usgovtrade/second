"Oh, yeah, he had a rough childhood." "When his mom died, I took him to the movies." "So did you come out of the closet?" "Sure." "I've had a couple boys, and they came out of the closet." "That's what they do." "You know, I'm thinking about dating a few men." "Yeah, well, we're all happy for you." "Oh, and here's your check." "Thank you, Michael." "Thank you very much." "We are so honored to be here with you tonight." "We just hope that the world will catch up with us." "Thank you so much, Michael and Susan and this very talented cast and crew and our fabulous sponsor, Estee Lauder." "Coming up next on AMC, back for the second time." "In a second season that began with such promise." "A second chance that so many of us have been waiting for." "In tonight's episode, "A Rumor of War"." "Good evening." "Tonight on AMC." "How are you?" "Thank you." "Good to see you." "I am not a homo, man." "Oh, my goodness." "It's just crazy to see him in the lead of a series like that." "Yeah." "Well, he was on a hit show in the '80s." "He used to be very close to the President." "But you know what?" "He's my friend." "It doesn't matter what happens now." "I'll be okay." "Now, it is so nice to see you, and this is your house?" "I have my pool house." "I'm having a pool house built." "Yeah." "This is one of your pool houses?" "And this pool house right here, would you call this a house?" "No, no." "I would call this a pool house." "Oh, okay." "Do you want to come over for a drink?" "Yeah, yeah." "Yeah?" "Yes." "I'm sure there's not enough time for that." "So you're gonna go to the dinner." "What dinner?" "This dinner at this place." "The dinner, darling, with everybody that's got this invitation and you're gonna go?" "Yeah." "Yeah, yeah." "I am." "I'm gonna go." "So you are a gay man." "Well, I'm not gay." "I'm a very happy heterosexual who really believes that you can love more than one person." "And, you know, you just shouldn't be ashamed of your sexuality." "Just as a heterosexual is proud to be straight." "You have no idea how proud I am to be heterosexual." "Why?" "I think it's very cool." "Can I be honest with you?" "I never thought I'd like having another boyfriend." "Yeah, sure." "I know what you mean." "I used to think it was fun when they did each other." "Well, it is fun." "It's a lot of fun." "But I think, maybe, maybe to be really, really honest with you," "I'm kinda over it." "What happened was, he met somebody else, and I was really upset, and so I just wanted to, you know, get my mind off it." "Can I tell you something?" "Yeah." "What you said to me right now, that's exactly how I felt when I found out." "And I still..." "I just need some time." "Some time to sort of digest it." "I didn't think it was possible for me to feel more betrayed." "To find out that he was with somebody else." "It was such a shock to me." "He never told me that he was cheating on me." "If I'd found out he was seeing somebody, I would've been really, really hurt." "What's up?" "You didn't really tell her that you were still..." "No." "No." "What?" "Still seeing other people?" "I never said anything about other people." "I never said anything about there being other people." "He says he doesn't care." "Well, so he told you not to tell me that he was still with other people?" "No." "He never says that to me." "He told me not to tell you that?" "He never tells me what not to tell you." "I'm going to be upset about this for a long time." "Why do you feel this way?" "Why do I feel what way?" "That you're upset." "Well, I'm upset." "That he didn't tell me." "This isn't something I've talked to him about." "I don't know." "You know what, honey?" "Don't worry about it." "Of course." "It's you." "You don't know that." "Well, of course I know that." "Don't get upset about it." "Really, don't worry about it." "You're upset because he didn't tell you that he was still seeing people?" "I mean, of course I'm upset that he didn't tell me." "Okay." "It's not about what's happening right now." "It's about the future." "Because you don't know?" "Well, why don't you think about it?" "It's not gonna happen." "No, you don't know that." "You don't know that." "He said it was over with one of his guys." "Yeah." "But it wasn't over." "There was still some connection there." "He was just with a few guys on the side." "So?" "You don't have to tell me." "I know." "I'm just telling you what he said." "Well, it isn't the same." "One thing I can say, I'm very clear about who I'm with." "So let me tell you about what I said." "I didn't expect the other person to be gone, so I would just go on and be..." "You know, whatever I could be with my friends." "Have a nice dinner or something." "But he was actually there." "And there's no way to forget that." "I don't know, I don't think that's exactly the same." "It was just a little more than that, so..." "A little more?" "I think we're making much more out of this than is necessary." "Yeah, you know, you say that now, but the truth is it's been tough." "It has been tough, you know?" "It has been tough on the kids and on him and me." "And I didn't feel like I knew what I was supposed to do." "He was supposed to tell me." "He was supposed to be able to explain himself in a nice way that would help me make sense of it, and... it was very, very hard." "And I never, ever felt that he wanted me there." "But I'd like to just say this, that... the fact that I did not feel anything from you, from you of all people, that I don't know, is..." "I think that's very strange." "No." "No, it isn't." "It's not strange at all." "Why would he be so upset to tell you?" "You know what?" "Maybe he didn't know." "Maybe he didn't know how you would feel about him or..." "Maybe he didn't know how you would feel about him." "How would he know how I would feel about him?" "What do you think?" "I don't think it's that simple." "Well, I think it's pretty damn simple." "I'm sorry." "It's okay." "I didn't mean it like that." "You're such an unbelievable asshole, but you're a great guy." "It was a lot easier for me to say the things I was saying to you on the way over there." "It was a lot easier, because I really felt like you were right there." "That was weird, huh?" "I don't know, it just seemed kind of weird to hear you talk about him as if he were there in person." "What, did I put on a tape or something?" "But it just seemed so real." "Are you sure he said he would meet me?" "Yeah." "He was gonna meet you at that restaurant?" "Yeah, I told him that's where I was going to the dinner, and he just kind of said that we should talk." "He said he would meet me." "He said we would talk." "He didn't want to meet at the restaurant." "Oh, he was in a hurry when he called?" "No." "I mean, I think it was because he didn't want to, you know, break away from other things that he was doing." "Yeah." "Why don't you tell me what you thought he wanted?" "I think he just wanted to meet, and..." "Well, in the first place," "I think he just wanted to just feel my presence." "And then he went back to the other side to do the stuff that he's gotta do and..." "Right." "It was weird, right?" "I mean, it was a lot weirder than I anticipated it being." "You know, it was strange how I felt." "I mean, the weirdest thing is that it was as if I was with somebody else for a few moments</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:51
