Characters

Aizen Academy students
Chairperson Iba - A female first-year who is very energetic, kind, and helpful to her friends. When she saw the Homunculi and Hollows coming, she hid in a locker and was found by the main characters. She becomes the first sacrifice for Yumichika's execution and is put into a mental hospital. After her release, she runs into Hiyori. After being forced to deal with the events in the school, she transfers to another school. She also becomes friends with Marechiyo and Kusano.
Chairperson Sasaki - A female first-year, who has a habit of drinking too much alcohol and is easily influenced by others. She becomes the second sacrifice for Yumichika's execution and is put into a mental hospital. After her release, she marries Kusano and becomes a mother. In the alternate future, she is killed by Yumichika during the 100th battle and Marechiyo buries her at the same tomb as the first sacrifice, Masaki Iba.
Chairperson Nagi - A first-year male, who is very skilled at sports and often competes with others. He is always being accused of looking down on other people, as shown by Haruna's statement, but he's really a nice person. He does not participate in any events during the time skip due to a knee injury and is absent in chapter 32. Later, he is forced to be the sacrifice for Shun's execution. After dying, he is the seventh Homunculi victim, who was killed by Mashiro. He was buried next to the other sacrifices in the graveyard.
Chairperson Yamato - A male second-year, who is very kind and easy going. He is a member of the Fist of Justice group. When Giemon reveals himself to the student body, he becomes a sacrifice in a trial for Yumichika's execution. At first, he is angered when Yumichika says he won't fight him, but he changes his mind once Yumichika reveals his reasoning for his actions. He is the fifth sacrifice in the mental hospital, but survives and later gets transferred to a mental hospital in another city. Later he is forced to die in a war with the Homunculi, but survived to have a daughter. It is revealed that he was alive and well in chapter 58, which means that he faked his death to go on a trip.
Masaki Iba - A female third-year, who is the first sacrifice for Yumichika's execution. Her fate is unknown as she dies in a mental hospital. She may be living happily ever after in Heaven.
Sara - A first-year female who is kind-hearted, but naive and easily hurt. She is Yumichika's fianc√©, who becomes a sacrifice in order to protect her. She is the sixth sacrifice.
Kusano - A second-year male, who is a former athlete and a star volleyball player. He was the one who stopped the 100th battle. He decides to commit suicide after learning that he can't see Yumichika, however Marechiyo persuades him otherwise.
Hiyori - A second-year female, who is friendly and quiet. She becomes very quiet after the 100th battle. She becomes the girlfriend of Kusano and helps him take over his mother's company. She can only see the future, meaning she can predict the future using logic, and cannot change her fate. After the 100th battle, she becomes a full-time student after graduating from high school. She is also known as the "Diva of Divine Fist" for her prowess in boxing.

Iba Clan
Chairperson Iba - The current head of the Iba Clan, who used to run the Iba Clan until Kikuko's death. She was forced into retirement by Shuichi Iba and later died. The Homunculi turned her into a Demon Cloth and she has a mental link with Masaki, the sacrificial victim for Shun's execution.
Shuichi Iba - The former head of the Iba Clan. He was killed by Rangiku Matsumoto, one of the founders of the Shinigami Clan, due to his failure to execute Yumichika, as well as threatening to kill the Iba Clan if his son did not join his family's side. He had killed Kikuko, Rangiku's mother.
Nagi Mutsuki - A first-year student at the Iba Clan, who is Shuichi's son. After his father's death, he is forced to be the sacrifice for Shun's execution.
Mashiro - The younger brother of Nagi. He was killed by a Homunculus but came back to life. He lived his life for the sake of others, such as his friends and Kusano. He was found by Chachamaru to protect him from Kusano's father and was also killed by Kusano's father before he could kill the young man.
Mafuyu - The leader of the Iba Clan. She was killed by one of the Homunculi to turn the Iba Clan into their supporters, but she is later revived by Nagi. She is then killed again by Nagi to make sure the two of them never interact with one another.

Shinigami Clan
Rangiku Matsumoto - The leader of the Shinigami Clan. She was the one who came up with the plans for the 100th battle in order to defeat the Hollows. She was also the one who ordered Retsu's execution as he no longer worked for her.
Kikujo Muryou - The current leader of the Shinigami Clan after Rangiku's death. Like Shuichi, he too, was killed by Rangiku after failing to defeat Yumichika and thus allowing the Homunculi to control the Shinigami Clan.
Kikoku - A first-year student at the Shinigami Clan. His fate is unknown as he was placed into a mental institution where the Shinigami take all their failed test cases.
Shinji Kagura - A first-year student at the Shinigami Clan who believes that the truth about the world is right in front of everyone and is very enthusiastic. His fate is unknown as he was placed into a mental institution.
Retsu - A first-year student at the Shinigami Clan. He, along with Takuma, are sent to the Iba clan to ensure Yumichika is defeated as a sacrifice for the 100th battle. The two of them later find out that their plans did not succeed, and Takuma and Retsu are both killed by Homunculi. However, after Retsu's death, he revives to become a slave for the Homunculi to keep his comrades from winning the 100th battle, only to die after Rangiku's death and Retsu's betrayal.
