Sidney Mier (8 September 1922 – 23 December 1989) was a British documentary film maker.

Mier was born in Edmonton, London, the son of a Lithuanian Jewish refugee from the Nazi holocaust who became a schoolteacher. As a child, he witnessed severe air raids during the London Blitz and lived through World War II.

He began his career as an amateur boxer and fought on the British amateurs' Heavyweight title under the name of Sid Mier and the Millers. He then moved to becoming a professional boxer with 11 fights, and in 1952 was advised to give up professional boxing due to his left eyelid being so badly damaged by an opponent's right-hand punch that it left him temporarily blind. He turned his attention to documentaries about boxing, in both the UK and abroad.

Mier made a significant documentary with the German photographer  in 1969 on the boxer Joe Louis before his death the year before, in a road accident in Apalachin, New York.

Mier died in Camden, London, in 1989 at the age of 67.
