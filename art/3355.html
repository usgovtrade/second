Cars and trucks in the race for world's best-looking, most sporty car

Cars and trucks in the race for world's best-looking, most sporty car

Aston Martin's DB10 is an advanced concept vehicle that hints at the company's design direction for its next generation of sports cars. The exterior of the car is based on a radical new shape that, when used as a basis for a production car, will revolutionize the way a sports car is designed. The interior has been created for a driver to spend time in, not just get in and go. In the concept, it is a four-seater with room for a crew of two. In production form, it will have four seats and feature a luggage area.

In other sports car news, the world's three oldest-still-operating manufacturers will battle for supremacy at the 86th running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France. It's the first time since 2011 that Aston Martin, Jaguar and Ferrari have been present together at the famed race.

Audi will showcase a new family of electric supercars at the LA Auto Show. The models are part of its vision to offer electric vehicles of varying sizes and performance levels. The concept for the car is a five-seater crossover with seating for up to seven people.

Also in LA, Lexus will show off its all-new RX concept and an LX concept SUV featuring its new luxury design language.

Lexus' upcoming flagship sedan will come to market as a rival for other full-size luxury cars, like the Cadillac CT6 and the BMW 7 Series. Like all Lexus sedans, it will feature innovative safety technology.

Ford has revealed its new Shelby GT500 Mustang. The latest generation of the iconic model will feature an 8.3-liter V8 that makes 800 horsepower and more than 1,000 pounds of torque. It will also use new technologies to ensure safety and great handling.

Ford will showcase its redesigned Ford F-150 Raptor and reveal the redesigned Ford Bronco off-road vehicle in Detroit. Ford plans to roll out the F-Series Super Duty pickup truck by the end of 2018.

To build anticipation for the New York Auto Show, Toyota is releasing a series of five videos showing how cars and trucks at the show are tested and tuned. Toyota is a member of the New York Auto Show's Media Partner Program.
