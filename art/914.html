Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have developed a structural composite made of concrete and carbon nanotubes that has amazing properties. Graphene sheets can easily bond to the surface of nanotubes, which have a honeycomb crystalline structure. The graphene-filled nanotubes can self-heal themselves in even the most dramatic accidents. These materials are said to be more flexible than even reinforced concrete and are easily fabricated. In tests with a quarter-inch thick concrete sample, concrete-graphene composites were able to withstand a compression load of over 1.2 million pounds. In addition, they're also impervious to water absorption.The concrete-graphene composite is stronger and less expensive than any concrete made of conventional materials, according to the university.

A self-repairing concrete that mends itself by itself

If you're anything like me, you're wondering how the heck you are going to pay for this. If anyone even attempts to make this happen, forget about the cost of conventional concrete, let alone this, it's going to cost everyone money. Not to mention the fact that concrete doesn't actually mend itself, because that wouldn't work. However, there are actually materials that do the job of hardening and mending when it is not being subjected to a load. These materials have the property of self-healing, but that's something that is difficult to find in nature. In fact, no natural product has been discovered with this property, although scientists are looking into its existence.

In the construction industry, structural composites are already an interesting alternative to conventional concrete. Reinforced concrete can be seen at most construction sites, even though this technique of construction is fairly new. It's been said that reinforced concrete is a combination of cement, which is the binding agent for concrete, and sand and gravel, which makes it more compact. However, this conventional concrete is not the only kind of concrete. In fact, only 2% of concretes are conventional concretes.
