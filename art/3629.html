Tara is simply amazing! After our wedding, she spent many hours editing, working with her computer and photos, creating the finished product for our photo album. She made sure that we received the items in a timely fashion and took care to keep us informed of the status of our order. We are so grateful for the fabulous album that Tara created for us and we will be using her again for our other life milestones. Thank you Tara!!

I truly love my photo book! She was very helpful and took extra time to work with me to make sure I was satisfied with my end product. Tara captured some of my favorite memories in my own unique style! I would definitely recommend her to anyone in need of a fantastic album.

Rebecca O’Neil, Tiffin, OH

I loved the photos and book so much that I went to purchase another book for another occasion. The quality of the pictures was fantastic and the book was very professional and had beautiful binding, but also my photos really stood out. Tara went above and beyond what I expected, making me feel extremely comfortable with the choices I had made. I loved it so much, that I used this service for my daughter’s wedding and for me, when my husband passed away and I wanted to have an updated picture of him, along with my mother-in-law. I also have used Tara to provide me with cards for my engagement pictures and was able to customize that to her needs, even though I didn’t have all of the specifics she needed, she still gave me what I needed to get the effect I wanted. It has been great working with Tara, and you are always welcome back anytime you want to have a second look!!

I am so glad I used Tara and had her take care of this important part of my life. The book turned out to be the perfect keepsake to mark our journey into parenthood. She took time to edit and enhance my photos and was very easy to work with. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a unique customized keepsake!

This was by far the best purchase we have made in a long time. Our friends and family are just in love with our keepsakes. Thank you for helping us create our special memories.

We would highly recommend Tara to anyone and would love to get another album or keepsake made in the future!!

Tara is extremely professional. She is always easy to work with and did a wonderful job of putting together my gallery for me. It turned out so beautiful and I love the album she did!

Debbie, Tiffin, OH

I was very excited to have my wedding pictures done by Tara Taylor Photography. I used Tara when my son was born. I loved the album that she created for me. The first thing I saw when I opened the envelope was the wonderful, artistic frame. My favorite page was when she put together a photo book of my son’s first two years. Tara is incredibly talented at photographing a newborn baby and she has a great eye for composition.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:39
