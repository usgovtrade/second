"He's not here yet." "You can send it in." "Hey." "Hey." "You look better." "Is that a new job?" "Yeah." "Aren't I a fright?" "I should've worn the suit." "You should." "Well, you look fine." "It's going to be like old times here." "How did it go in Kansas City?" "Not too good." "You know." "Not so great." "Well, I can't help you there." "What is this?" "Well, it's a bottle of wine." "I know, I just..." "I didn't think we were going to get very high." "Who says we're not?" "Just take a minute." "I don't know what's changed, but you're just not the same anymore." "All right." "You're right." "But it's not so much that." "It's been..." "I don't know, everything, really." "You still haven't given me a good reason for all of this." "Oh, God." "I don't know." "I don't know." "I know." "Hey." "Come on." "Come on." "Let's get on the same page here." "You didn't come home for two years, basically because you didn't want to see me." "You were practically dead when they pulled you out of that well." "It's not like I just didn't want to see you." "I didn't think I'd ever see you again." "I mean, after that well," "I just wanted you to be gone." "I just wanted you gone." "So, why now?" "I don't know." "I..." "I thought I was going to go crazy if I didn't at least try and reach out to you." "And then I thought about you leaving me those voice mails." "And I started thinking about all those Saturdays when I would drive home from basketball and I'd see you walking across the quad to Modern Languages," "and I'd just..." "I just wanted to say something to you." "I mean, God, I don't know, Delia." "Maybe I'm just going crazy." "I mean, but when I see you here in this house in this chair, it's just..." "I just can't help but think, you know," ""Wow." "There's just so much that I miss about her."" "All those mornings in the coffee shop, where we'd have our quiet conversations about things that didn't matter, where we'd just be together." "There's just so much that I missed." "Yeah." "Yeah." "I guess you did miss a lot." "And I miss a lot of that, too." "It hurts us too much to see each other." "It's not good for us." "I think that now you need to try to understand that." "Hey, wait." "Here." "Thank you." "Of course." "Okay, I'm going to go out there and start your car." "No, I'll do it." "You go sit down." "You're not going to leave me now." "No, no, I'm going to do it." "You just sit down." "I'll do it." "Okay?" "Will you go and get the door?" "Okay." "Don't look so scared." "What?" "What?" "You have to go in now." "Why?" "It's a surprise." "Get in there." "What's going on?" "It's a surprise." "No, I don't like surprises." "What if something bad's about to happen?" "Don't be such a baby." "There's nothing bad going to happen." "What if there is?" "We're having dinner with your family." "Yeah, we are." "That's weird." "Go ahead, get in there." "Oh, I don't like this." "Get in there, you wuss." "Hey." "Are you happy?" "Hello?" "Anybody in there?" "I can't see you." "Wait." "You can't see me?" "No, no, I can't see anything." "Well, hang on." "I'll turn the lights on." "All right." "Yeah, now I can see you." "Okay." "Great." "No, I'm not happy." "No, I don't want to do this." "I don't want to do this." "Get down on the ground." "We gotta get out of here now." "What the hell was that?" "What the hell was that?" "I don't know." "I don't know." "No!" "I don't know." "We have to get out of here!" "What is it?" "Who's there?" "There was someone else." "Hey, where you going?" "Where are you going?" "Where are you going?" "Let me go!" "I have to go." "What do you have to go for?" "Hey, what's going on?" "Who was that?" "Who was that?" "I don't know." "Well, who was it?" "I don't know." "Hello?" "Rudy?" "Rudy, there's someone in the house." "What are you doing?" "Rudy?" "Stop!" "There's someone in the house!" "I know." "We're supposed to be meeting here right now." "Yeah." "Did you call them?" "No." "Are you okay?" "Yeah." "Yeah, I'm fine." "What do you mean, you're fine?" "What happened?" "Just..." "I had a bad feeling, that's all." "What do you mean?" "Just a bad feeling." "Like anxiety." "What do you got there?" "Nothing." "I don't have anything." "Why don't you open the door?" "You wanna open the door, really?" "Okay." "All right." "Okay, then." "All right." "There you go." "Just open it up." "Okay." "You want me to open it?" "No, I'll open it." "Okay." "Open it." "Hold on." "Hold on." "All right." "Okay, I'll..." "I'll open it." "Sorry." "Did you make this?" "What?" "You made this?" "No, I found this." "Yeah, but what is this?" "I don't know, but I just..." "I felt weird about leaving it there, though, so..." "You know, don't worry about it." "Okay." "What are you thinking?" "Nothing." "I'm just..." "I'm just happy to see you." "You've seemed a little distant lately." "Rudy?" "What?" "They're gone." "They were right here." "Who's gone?" "The children." "They were right here." "They were just right here!" "Delia, calm down." "They just vanished!" "I told them not to go in the basement." "Okay." "Okay, I'll go look for them." "I'll come with you." "No, I'll go, all right?" "You stay here and you lock the door behind me." "What?" "No, we're in this together, Delia." "It's not safe for you to be going back there on your own, okay?" "Okay." "You all right?" "Yeah." "I'll meet you in there." "We're looking for two children, about 6 years old, dark hair." "Delia?" "It's us." "Can you open up the door?" "We just wanna come in and get you guys out of the house, okay?" "Come on, sweetie." "It's just us." "You're gonna be all right." "Delia." "Delia." "I'm her husband." "She won't let me in." "I was just wondering if I could maybe come in and wait with you guys, maybe go to the station to file a report." "We'll go to the police station." "Delia, you okay?" "All right, here, sweetie." "Come here." "It's all right." "All right, let's go." "Let's go." "All right, here we go." "What do we do?" "Should I call a locksmith?" "It's gonna take forever to get someone out here." "Can't you pick it?" "I mean, if it's something simple like a knob, yeah." "But something like this, I don't know." "What about a hammer and a chisel?" "Maybe." "Or maybe we just hit it with something hard and we just get it open that way." "I've got a bat." "A bat?" "That's great." "That's great." "Bat me down the door." "You don't have to be sarcastic." "I was being sincere." "Thank you." "I think that's probably the best idea." "Let's get the bat." "All right." "Can we...?" "I got it." "You keep an eye on the kid." "What are you gonna do?" "Hit it with the bat." "You serious?" "Yeah." "Let's do it." "Here we go." "Batman and Robin."
