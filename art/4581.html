According to data released by World Bank in September, global economic growth slowed to its lowest pace in five years in 2019, coming in at just 3.2 per cent.

This number was far lower than the 3.4 percent estimate of World Bank's July forecast and also below previous projections in its June estimate of 3.7 per cent.

Amidst a tumultuous 2019 where Donald Trump's impeachment and ongoing Russia controversy took centre stage, the world also faced a massive global recession

The global economy is currently going through the worst slowdown in more than a decade with many analysts citing growing pessimism around the future of the world economy.

As per the World Bank, a global recession has been triggered by trade conflicts, the US-China trade war, slowing global growth and higher interest rates, particularly in advanced economies.

Global recession is a phenomenon which includes global stock market decline by at least 20 per cent.

In September 2019, Global recession was further compounded by economic slowdowns from India, Brazil and the US.

In September, The world's largest economy, US, entered its first recession since the financial crisis of 2007/8 and its impact was felt globally.

China, which had reported weaker-than-expected economic growth in the first half of the year, also recorded economic slowdown in the third quarter.

The ongoing global downturn has led to significant drop in equity markets across the world with China's Hang Seng falling 25.7 per cent in 2019 while Japan's benchmark Nikkei was down 7.7 per cent and Germany's Dax shed 6.1 per cent in 2019.

Germany's benchmark DAX Index lost six per cent from an all-time high hit in January 2019.

The 'trade war' between the United States and China has also weighed on global growth, especially in Asia.

But the drop in global growth has had implications for other regions as well, particularly Africa, which suffered from its recent commodity price collapse and from low oil prices and capital outflows.

'A series of shocks, including slower growth in the United States and China, as well as tensions with the Middle East, are likely to weigh on global economic growth prospects.

'China and India will struggle to generate strong domestic demand to sustain growth, given their growing dependence on exports to sustain domestic demand,' the World Bank said.

Meanwhile, emerging markets are at their weakest growth in decades amid an escalating global trade war.

Emerging market growth is currently at its weakest in a decade, with emerging market currencies at their weakest in a decade, China's slowest expansion in 25 years and India's weakest since 2012, according to the World Bank.

In its World Economic Outlook report, the World Bank said the global economy may grow 3 per cent next year, still far below what it had been growing at for the past decade.

The United States is expected to slow to 1.9 per cent growth in 2020 after a 3.1 per cent expansion in 2019.

Japan's GDP is expected to grow at 0.8 per cent in 2020 after 0.9 per cent growth in 2019.

Even Europe's economy will be sluggish as Germany's growth forecast falls to 0.5 per cent and the eurozone as a whole grows at only 0.4 per cent.

'By 2024, the World Bank says China's growth will be 7.6 per cent and India's will be 7.8 per cent, which is more in line with global GDP growth' said Marc Chandler, chief global economist at TS Lombard.
