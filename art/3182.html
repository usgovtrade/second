This blog is about everything and nothing. A cornucopia of topics in no particular order and my thoughts on them.

I love to have fun with no regrets. My cup runneth over. You gotta have it and use it if you don't, it'll leak out. You can have fun and still stay in line if you don't blow it or you can let it blow and play hard and get in trouble, this year or next year.

I'm gonna take life head on the way it comes at me and give it back just the same. If I don't, life will take me and I will not like that. I do so love happy endings, I do. Life isn't always like that, but you can have happy endings if you try.

I want to live each day to its fullest and look for the blessings of life along the way. I love my life and my life has been a blessing.

I believe that everything happens for a reason, that God is in control and I'd better hope so or I'll miss out on all the fun. But I live and I learn so every day I get to sit back and review and assess. It's not about what happened, it's what we learn from it.

Misery does like company so I'm never too lonely. I've been single nearly 25 years and it is great. I've been married, for nearly 20 years and it was a great ride.

I try to help others that I can in any way that I can. It's all about me, maybe me helping another will give me a bit of happiness.

I don't do it because I like giving, I do it because I like to help others and it makes me happy when they say thank you for what you've done for them. It's more rewarding than one might think.

My life and the way I handle my life are all up to me and I don't do it any different than I did yesterday.

Life is good and life is bad, we all have our ups and downs but the downs don't last forever and the ups don't last forever either. We learn from both, we can choose how the rest of our life is handled. I choose to handle mine well so that every day counts for something. That's me, not you, we're different, we don't have to be the same but we can be different in a good way.

About Me

I'm a woman that has lived a lot in my life and learned a few things. I don't believe in doing things halfway, I always try to make things better the best that I can. I want to talk to people about things that are important to me. If I can help someone, no matter how small the thing that's bothering them, I do it. That's why I started this blog, I can't do it alone anymore and I need to do something.
I'm in my 50s, I have a degree in Social Work, a license as a Professional Counselor and have had a private counseling practice. So, I think I have the background and the know-how to make this happen.
I've tried blogging before but it was a mess so I didn't get very far with it. I want to do it and do it right so, here we go.
I'm also on twitter @KarinTaylorBks.

About My Blog

My blog is a place where I will be talking about things that are important to me. There will be personal posts as well as posts about counseling and life in general. I'll write about what is on my mind, how I feel, and what is important to me. I've lived a lot and have a lot of interests and hobbies but I never know where to start when it comes to writing about those interests. This blog is about me just starting out.
