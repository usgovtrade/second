I don’t really care about that but it’s just a bonus for me and I take pride in that.”

“I’ve been pretty much healthy this whole time, but it was on my mind. I want to play more.”

Despite being on the brink of his professional debut, Daly is already one of the more mature rookies around.

But is this too soon to bring a player like Lyles into the fold?

“I think so,” head coach Larry Drew said. “Obviously, there is going to be some bumps and bruises there. He’s in midseason shape and he’s about to come out of high school.”

If it’s not Daly, it’ll be anyone else’s turn.

The Suns have lost two major pieces of their past in Brandon Knight (ACL) and Archie Goodwin (broken left wrist). Phoenix can use a talented scorer, and Lyles’ ability to score from inside or out will not only help the Suns immediately but for years to come.

And what better team than the Suns for Lyles to make his debut. This may be the first chance most NBA fans get to see him and D’Angelo play together.

“It will be fun,” D’Angelo said. “It will be a fun matchup.”

Lyles believes he has had the experience of a mature veteran this summer. Now, he’s ready for the real thing.

As he prepares for the start of the season, Lyles knows he has big shoes to fill. But the Suns are confident he is up to the task.

So is this the time for Lyles to make a huge statement and show what he’s made of? Or will it take longer?

Well, here’s a reminder of what Lyles can do.
