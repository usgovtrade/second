2 Minutes

Description: Two minutes of blindside time was added to one of the last plays of the game. No penalty was assessed.

Offensive Holding

1 Second

Description: Carolina was called for offensive holding on a 6-yard sack.

Offensive Pass Interference

5 Yards

Description: On a 4th down in the 2nd quarter, the Panthers are hit with OPI on the previous play, so they were called for an OPI on the same down and then were hit again with another OPI a few plays later. The Ravens challenged and were assessed the flag. The official allowed a delay of game, moved up the chain to a 1-yard penalty, and called a 5-yard holding to make up for the missed call.

Quarterback Delay of Game

No Penalty

Description: On the last play of the half, a penalty could not be assessed.

Illegal Contact

No Penalty

Description: On the very next play, a Panthers player was called for illegal contact and a flag was thrown.

No Delay of Game Called On Last Play of Second Half

3 Minutes

Description: On the last play of the 2nd half, no delay of game could be called after the fact. This caused a 3-minute runoff to continue.

Defensive Holding

No Penalty

Description: On a 1st and 10, the Panthers defensive backs were called for defensive holding on a Panthers running back. The penalty was declined.

Defensive Holding

No Delay of Game Called On Last Play of the Game

1:14 Seconds

Description: On the last play of the game, no delay of game could be called after the fact. This caused a 1-minute runoff to continue.

That makes for an absolutely stunning finish to an otherwise unremarkable game. We're down to 6, I think. And this is the best possible way to go into the playoffs. The Patriots win, and then they get the Ravens in the divisional round. It's either that or they beat Jacksonville and go to Pittsburgh. Who knows what's going to happen from there, but it's a great spot. I imagine the Jets will have a harder time than they might have wanted in a first-round game against the Ravens.

That's Baltimore and New England through. Seattle and Miami are just winning to finish out. The Dolphins are done in the first round, which means Buffalo will host a rematch of last year's AFC championship game.
