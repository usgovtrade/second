We asked key informants, namely, the president of RIRIP, the head of the rice production, and the head of the project design and execution unit in the field. Informants were selected because of their key role in the project. The head of RIRIP provides information on the organization of RIRIP. The head of RIRIP provides information on RIRIP's organization and on its workplan. For more information on these 2 interviews, see <http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/E17-1548>). The head of the rice production unit was selected because he is more knowledgeable on field and farming operations, and the project. Through the use of thematic analysis, we identify and analyze the concerns that emerge from these interviews and discuss potential solutions.

### A.5.3.2.. What the project has done {#phnch12359-sec-0109}

We conducted a document review of the project, and from this document, we learned the following:

‐   It is a long‐term project with a 5‐year duration.

‐   The project is based on rice varieties developed through cross‐pollination between two rice varieties.

‐   All the work will be conducted within one field (Rizal province), and in all work activities, women will be identified as beneficiaries, in the field (Rizal province), and in the nursery (Nueva Ecija province).

‐   This project follows Philippine law that makes it legal to conduct research and development activities in the field. However, there are several challenges that are raised regarding the application of Philippine law to this particular case:

    The problem of the farmer's rights. The problem of the intellectual property rights. The problem of the human rights of the farmers. (Cited from the document).

‐   Despite these problems, the project has continued to operate under these laws.

‐   The project is supported by various organizations, namely, the government (local government and Department of Agriculture), universities, international development partners, and donor agencies.

### A.5.3.3.. Expected outcomes {#phnch12359-sec-0110}

We learned that the project has several expected outcomes, including:

‐   The development of a new variety of high yielding and dwarf rice that is resistant to certain diseases (crop), and to diseases of pests.

‐   This rice will yield up to 10 tons per hectare for 5 consecutive years.

‐   This rice will be available to Filipino farmers in time for the celebration of Filipino Independence Day in 1998.

‐   This rice will be resistant to both abiotic and biotic stresses, including salinity, drought, flood, and low nitrogen.

‐   It will be highly nutritious and with desired levels of protein, carbohydrate, and essential fatty acids (EFAs).

‐   The project is expected to generate income for farmers.

### A.5.3.4.. Actual outcomes {#phnch12359-sec-0111}

Rice production in Rizal province began in 1993 using a single variety of rice, IR8, and is currently cultivated with another single variety, IR36. The average yield of rice per hectare is 2--3 tons per hectare. The rice grains have a quality level equal to commercial rice varieties in terms of high market value. The major constraints faced by farmers are rice grain quality that does not meet local food standards and crop quality levels that are not sufficient to support a decent standard of living, lack of income and the ability of farmers to finance new rice varieties and maintain improved varieties.

In 1996, the project started using a single variety of Dang‐Dang rice, which is also called Rizal NIL, which is the result of a cross‐pollination between IR8 and BR29. Rizal province was selected for this project because there is high production of high‐yielding rice and with excellent quality among other varieties of rice in the region. A number of farmers in Rizal province are also involved in rice and maize production. During 1997, trials for seed production of Dang‐Dang rice began, with the expectation that farmers would produce these seeds and would plant them in their fields. It is expected that farmers would plant only the Dang‐Dang seeds, as these seeds would yield the best results. To determine the seed yield, 1 kg of seeds of Dang‐Dang rice was sown. A hectare of Dang‐Dang rice is expected to yield 25--30 tons of rice grain and to give good yields and quality because of its resistance to diseases and to pests, such as brown plant‐hopper, leaf blast, root‐gall mite, rice dwarf virus, and rice tungro virus. Dang‐Dang is expected to replace IR8 and BR29 as the best local rice for Rizal farmers, because of its higher yield and yield stability under adverse field conditions and diseases and pests. By 1998, farmers in Rizal were already planting seeds of Dang‐Dang rice in their rice paddies.

In addition, the project has developed a crop variety called Dang‐Dang rice II, which has been produced by a cross‐pollination between IR8 and Dang‐Dang rice. The seeds of Dang‐Dang rice II were sown in 1998 in Rizal province. The results of these tests are yet to be published.

Through interviews and document review, we learned that during the project, RIRIP has been successful in producing seeds from Dang‐Dang rice (NILs), especially from seeds sown in the 1998 growing season.

The actual outcomes from the study reveal that the project was successful in creating a new rice variety that is resistant to various disease and pests, including biotic and abiotic stresses. Although this outcome is still to be verified by published scientific research, it has yet to be published in scientific journals. The only outcome of the study that is already published in a scientific journal is the development of a new high‐yielding and dwarf rice variety. It has been used to replace two rice varieties, IR8 and IR36, which have been very problematic.

A comparison between the actual and the expected outcomes from the study shows that the actual outcomes of the study were significantly different from the original goals. These outcomes could be significantly different from the original goals because they were focused on creating a new variety of rice that would produce high yields under adverse climatic conditions, as opposed to the desired outcome of providing farmers with better varieties. According to researchers, the actual outcomes of this project are similar to the outcomes of other long‐term genetic development projects that have been undertaken in other rice growing regions, including CIMMYT (Center for International Maize and Wheat Improvement).

### A.5.3.5.. The benefits of the project {#phnch12359-sec-0112}

The study shows that research has played a significant role in improving the livelihood of farmers in the Philippines. As has already been discussed, the project has developed a new variety of high‐yielding rice that can provide higher yields under adverse climatic conditions. It has also shown that the benefits of using public--private partnerships in developing countries can result in significant benefits for poor farmers. As the project has shown, public--private partnership can improve the livelihood of the poor. The research outcomes show that, although initial project goals and expected outcomes were somewhat unrealistic, they can be achieved. The project has proven to be successful in meeting the goals set by its developers. In fact, the project is expected to meet its goals, as the project has produced a new rice variety that can increase yields under adverse climatic conditions, including the drought, flood, and biotic stresses, including rice blast disease.

### A.5.3.6.. The constraints faced by the project {#phnch12359-sec-0113}

The study revealed a number of constraints that were encountered during the project, including:

‐   Problems with obtaining seeds from farmers for testing purposes because of the high costs involved in conducting field experiments and due to the lack of cooperation of farmers. (Cited from documents).

‐   Problems with disease problems in the field as shown by the high disease incidence of foliar blast, especially from rice brown dwarf virus (RBDV) and rice tungro virus (RTV) in Rizal province. (Cited from the document).

‐   Delays in implementing new rice varieties, including BR29 and Dang‐Dang rice, as these varieties were late in appearing in the market because they could not be certified under the mandatory quality standards in the Philippines. (Cited from document).

‐   Disease resistance is only for certain diseases as opposed to the expected level of resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, including salinity, drought, flood, and low nitrogen. (Cited from documents).

‐   Difficulty of growing rice in the field because the price of rice has been high and because of high costs of seed production. (Cited from documents).
