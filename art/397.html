I would say it was one of the easiest ways to make a girl want you and that "I'm still not dancing" line is the best "come hither" ever in a music video.

There's also an old video with a chick dancing to it.... it's a bunch of little chicks and they look like they're playing in the park..

"I'd appreciate it if you didn't do that" i don't think you're funny but you're ok.. thanks a lot. i'll be sure to tell you what i'm thinking every time i see a chick on the street. i think it'd be helpful if i had it in writing.

If you're a girl there's a good chance that you don't get asked out to coffee by a guy you like by text message (i.e. texting the girl you like while waiting for your mom to finish getting her nails done), and that's totally fine, I'd never recommend that, but that's just the way life goes.

But when it comes to dancing, I would say at least 30% of all females have at some point or another been asked to dance, it's just how people interact with other people.

But I'm sure that you haven't had to struggle with it enough to have to get some help. Don't worry.

Anyway, this was a good video to share.

You're right on the one hand. On the other hand, if you're not looking to be chased down and taken by force, it may actually be prudent to follow this strategy. I don't think I can really call this one of the "hottest" sex strategies.

As a guy who's been looking for the girl of his dreams, I'm not quite sure how I feel about this advice. I actually like it. I was a bit perplexed by this at first, but after thinking about it for awhile, I think it makes sense. It just seems like the person who really wants you to pursue them will probably tell you to the face. And that's fine, because that's their choice to do so.

So I think this really depends on how you and the girl you're after feel. If she wants you to go after her, that's great! If not, I guess it doesn't really matter, since you just say that you didn't try or whatever.

Either way, this is a pretty effective sex technique.

I'll give you a chance to ask for clarification.

It depends, in fact, on what the girl does when you ask to dance. The more responsive she is the more of a chance she's really into you, and most of the people I know never say no to a guy they don't want.

What if I approach a girl and ask her if I can dance with her? I ask because I want to get to know her better. I am usually kind of shy so I'd rather not talk much about me myself. I kind of just want to find out more about her life and see if she would be interested in hanging out with me.

When you say "I want to get to know you better" you are putting the responsibility for seducing on the girl. Instead you should just relax and enjoy the dancing. You're already there, so the pressure is already off. You can just sit back and enjoy the music for awhile.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great strategy for dancing, especially for the reason you mentioned. But it's the same strategy you can use for any situation where the girl already likes you enough to want to dance with you.

You want to get to know her better and she wants to hang out with you? Hang out with her already!

I agree with D4RKM4L4S. Dude. Just relax and dance. Asking to dance with the girl should be the end of it. If she's into you, she'll go home with you. If not, she'll just dance and have a good time with you.

If you make the move to dance first you are also giving the appearance of being really self-centered. I know you're not, but the way your story is being presented you're making it sound like you're in front of a bunch of random girls and the only reason you're out is because you're that good at dancing.

But the real reason you're out is that you are a very attractive person who just loves dancing. Everyone knows that. Dancing is no excuse to not be able to interact with someone. So if you're just really into dancing, start telling them that.

I think that's the reason to start dancing in front of other people. You put a little bit more emphasis on the fact that you just love dancing, rather than how you are going to get the girl, especially if you're already comfortable dancing in front of her.

It's not a "girls beware, he can dance" kind of thing. You're dancing because you want to. That's what you can bring to the table. You're just an interesting, attractive, and extremely well-balanced person to be around, which is what you seem to be making it sound like. It's a natural transition to make, so keep doing it!

The advice you've been given seems like it would make any girl that you dance with (if she likes you) go home with you. Do you dance more just for that reason?

I'm not sure if it's my lack of communication skills, or something, but I don't think that many girls I've met will talk to me much.

I've talked to quite a few girls, but I've noticed that many of them won't want to dance with me. Most of them were very attractive and I tried to dance with them, but many of them wouldn't dance with me, even when I danced with everyone else.

But then I've talked to a girl at my school who is pretty hot and fun. We talked, and I couldn't get myself to stop dancing, which was stupid. She's pretty hot and I've known her for a long time, but she didn't really want to dance with me.

I danced with lots of people, some of them were very pretty and they talked a lot to me, but a lot of times when I danced with them they just wanted to be left alone. A lot of girls were doing my dancing for me, and pretty much everyone I danced with pretty much had at least a bit of a dance off going on and even when I danced with them it was more because they wanted to dance with me rather than me actually dancing with them.

I know this doesn't answer your question, but I wanted to let you know that I know how you feel. I'm not so great at dancing, but I'm pretty good at talking to people.

It's harder to dance in front of other people than it is to talk to people, so there must be some other reason behind it. I know this isn't a joke, but it can be tough getting girls to dance with you. You have to give them a good reason to dance with you.

Are you sure she likes you?

I've seen some pretty nice girls dancing at a venue on Saturday nights, but it seems like the girl you're talking to has a bit of a problem communicating.

Have you talked to her at all? Are you just there for the dancing?

Yeah, I can relate to this. But the key to not getting rejected is being calm and not moving too quickly. It's hard, because sometimes it seems like the other person doesn't want to dance, and then you move forward a little too quickly.

It's not because you're some sort of a genius at dancing. It's just like dancing. You have to find a system.

In fact, you can even do the same with dancing and dancing. Don't focus on it so much. Just listen to it and watch it, but don't force anything.

That's true about girls dancing, but you can't apply the same logic to all social situations.

Hey, why is it that you can't dance? Do you have a bad case of stage fright? Do you feel intimidated</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:30
