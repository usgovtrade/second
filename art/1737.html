There are a few people here at work that have developed the habit of
commenting "this is good software engineering and this is not." If you like
code like this, you will probably enjoy working with some of the stuff
mentioned in this article.

Wow, that is a very nice piece of code! It's pretty well commented too. Thanks
for the link.

Agreed, it's great, and I've been wanting a solid build tool that can handle
multideps for a while. Lots of people have come up with bits of the
mechanics, but Kodiak looks like the first to package them up nicely.

That is quite a bit of code in your sample, but it's very much work that
requires thought and a fair amount of coding skills. I don't think your friend
is "bashing" you for liking that kind of code; rather, it's really the same
code she sees from time to time... and is glad not to find herself in. It's a
different skill set than what she sees her day to day being a "computer
engineer".

Also, as she probably knows, the majority of code out there is not like that
either; but again, as she knows, it's not something she works with every day,
so it's only in passing that she'll see it. But from our side, it's not really
a topic we dwell on much. I'll note though that it's often really quite
simple, as simple as checking a boolean in a conditional branch. I have no
idea of the code you wrote in your example, but if it was just an if/else
statement checking a constant value, and you got paid by the kilobyte, no
doubt it would be great code. There's certainly nothing wrong with that
kinda' code.

If you haven't read it yet, you really should read The Mythical Man Month.

That is a great article. Thank you very much for your recommendation.

A related piece that I recently came across that got my mind ticking:

The Best Code is No Code at All

One of the most enjoyable parts of my PhD was to build and work on a prototype
of a tool that would do this: transform a piece of source code into a graph
with different node types, and visualize the transformation it underwent in a
graph where nodes were the different types of code. Because in the end it's
just graphs!

For a long time now, I have referred to comments like these as "meta-code."

I think a lot of people will disagree, but I find a lot of the same
observations with the sort of Python code I'm writing these days. I find that
when I'm writing Python (I have a lot of C experience) I'm thinking about my
code far more as a compiler would think about my code. This has been my
experience with all of the languages I've been "fluent" in, not just Python.
Often a good chunk of time is spent worrying about making it human readable,
while also ensuring the semantics are as simple and as close to the source
material as possible. Sometimes, in an effort to ensure clarity and human
readability the code is just a few extra characters away from being totally
unreadable and almost impossible to understand. Sometimes I try to put myself
into the writer's head. I think this is a good way to understand one's own
code and how best to express it. Not every programming language lends itself
well to this and I can see how not everyone thinks in code the same way.
Perhaps most of us, and if not, should. I will agree that you will generally
get fewer of these type comments in more complicated code. It's simply a
natural result of the amount of code one must put up with in that code. I like
"no code" code, because it's very important to focus on readability and
flexibility. There's many ways to write code and you should find the one that
works best for you.

I agree. But it is important to think about the difference between
readability and 'humanity' ;). One could look at e.g. C++ code and see a
million things that could be improved, but this does not automatically make
the code more readable. Often it just makes it more complex and hard to read
because it depends on too many things. Many people find that their Python code
is fairly readable, while their C++ code is not. And the same people that
enjoy Python do not necessarily enjoy C++.

When I am working with Python, I prefer to stay away from code constructs that
are obscure. In Python I prefer clear names and a minimal API that are
consistent over long time. But also beware of Python's builtin types: some are
unreadable and it is not obvious how to read the documentation (some methods
in __repr__ etc.).

But perhaps the most important thing in Python is that the code should be
readable and reusable. If you don't, it will be a total pain in the neck when
you look at it some years later, when you have forgotten many details that you
took for granted at the time (the names of methods that are called on the
object, the class, etc.). You will spend more time thinking about the code and
remembering the API of Python than what you put in your program. That's
certainly not a good use of your time! And this is not a Python-specific
argument, but applies to all programming languages.

I thought this was going to be the author of the "Python, or the Good, the
Bad, and the Ugly" blog.

I just can't help myself quoting this:

 _To see a lot of code without comments, where the code still doesn’t work,
is in fact depressing. If the program works, it’s boring. I can’t have enough
boring code. If it doesn’t work and you haven’t written a line of comments, I
can’t get angry enough to fix it._

~~~
joeevans1000
The thing is, sometimes there _are_ working code bases with no comments. Like
when there's a well-structured "API".

I feel bad for the author, because he has to look at a lot of poor-quality
code, only to then go in and write better code himself. That's not his
problem, though. It's the same problem we have with our own code. It's just
we're the only ones who have to look at it.

It's just my opinion, but when someone is a beginner and makes lots of poor
quality code, I believe it's natural to blame others for not helping them. But
that's a mistake: the student is not a bad programmer. They just lack
experience and know how, which means that they lack the _desire_ to learn.
They'll probably continue to make poor quality code for the rest of their
career. Blaming others is an excuse for them not to strive to grow beyond
this, and is ultimately self-defeating.

If the person _wants_ to be a better programmer, they'll _want_ to make the
better code. After all, it's not their fault that the code is bad. And so
they'll try harder to find better resources.

I think it is a matter of expectations. This quote perfectly shows that
code_gods_are_out_there attitude:

>I’m not saying this is “best code” at all. It’s not, but if I was to do it
again I’d write something similar. The code is easy to understand, it gets the
job done, and there’s nothing wrong with that.

That person probably has a high expectation about code quality. I guess,
