which he is represented, as is customary with all who set out on
a journey, kneeling before a crucifix and pronouncing a
prayer.

Mr. Toms, from his seat in the coach, which he
had taken when the new company departed, looked over the roof at
his new companions, who were now so near as to hear what he
said:

"Why, then, friend, what were the sins you went out
for? Did you hear any cries to that purpose in your own family?
Dost thou think me ignorant of the manner in which wicked
children are reclaimed by their fathers? Did not I, some twenty
years ago, reclaim a wicked girl of fourteen, who had run away
with another man's husband, after she had murdered hers? The
wretch she murdered was very near-related to me, and his wife
had carried him a live new-born babe, but had miscarried in the
journey, and had just made shift to crawl back, when this young
girl knocked him on the head with a lump of butter and drowned
him."

At this dreadful relation, Tom's heart would have burst,
but he concealed his feelings, and proceeded thus:--

"Yes, my dear friend, I did very like a wicked man, and
had I been well versed in the business, the girl might have been
saved. But, alas! sir, I have not lived so long in the world
without learning to speak the truth."

"Say you so, friend?" replied the stranger; "then
you must know that my husband and I have resolved to bring up a
son to the Church, or else turn him into the world again, and
let him become a robber and horse-stealer. But tell me, my man,
do you think my son will succeed in this good undertaking?"

"Sir," said Tom, "the only way to be sure of this is,
to call your son to sit in this box, and let him see how his
brother hath run away with my master's son, which is the cause
of my being here; that he may see he is to blame for it, as I
am, for my being here at all. For had it not been for the fear
of God, and the love we have for our children, we should all
have followed the vile counsel of the devil, who, by lying
teaching and such like arts, persuades people to break the
Commandments and disobey their parents. For which reason I,
though I hope my children will be holy and obedient, cannot so
easily believe it in the rest of my neighbours."

"Alas, friend," said the stranger, "you have a
noble understanding; but my son hath so much of the evil
spirit, that I could wish my son might sit in this box, and I
the son of a shepherd in this seat. Now, would you advise me,
to leave my son here?"

"Surely, friend," said Tom, "you will think on this
matter, for I cannot advise you to do any thing to disoblige
God, or disoblige your own son. Consider what it is to sit in
this box, which was appointed for a man of great piety and
learning, and to be punished for your negligence and
ignorance. The place is not fit for your son to live in, but to
sit in in penance and humiliation. You might with much less
trouble bring up your son to be a good man, and that the good
God might assist him in his life and conversation; and
instead of being here for ten, you will be here for ever and
ever."

"Ah, friend," said the stranger, "you have
taught me a good lesson; but, alas! I am afraid my son hath
the devil already too strong in him. Nay, he is too wicked to
live. And truly I am ashamed to bring up my children like
wolves, when they should be like lambs; so if thou canst
direct me to a good schoolmaster, that I may put my son to him,
I will bring him to school."

"No, not to be schoolmaster," said Tom, "but to a
wise man, to learn himself, and that is the schoolmaster that
will make him wise. No, he is too young, if you put him to a
schoolmaster. His studies must be to learn himself to be a
wise man, before he has skill to teach others. If I were you,
I would send him to school to an honest man, that will advise
him how to train himself, and then he will have the means in his
hand to govern and direct others. I have known boys to make a
better progress, and be worth more than their father, when they
took not the first place, but the second."

"My neighbour there," said the gentleman, "is a very
good example of what you are speaking of."

"Why, sir," said Tom, "did you not know, that he was
a very foolish boy till he was seven years old? He was as
foolish as any boy that ever was born."

"Well," said the gentleman, "I have always heard, that
it is best for children not to know much at first."

"My friend," said Tom, "you are ignorant of the
world. Let me tell you, that a child must be born wise, or it
must be born a fool. The first is more common, and the second
more foolish. And let me tell you, that one of the greatest
signs of a bad man is, that he takes for wise men those that
are children and fools, and for true men those that are fools
and children. For all men are fools till they are full grown,
and I hope your son will not have the folly to think himself a
man till he be six-and-thirty. And though he is my master's
son, and so I have some trouble in getting him out of the way,
yet, since he does me such mischief, I must endeavour to bring
him to reason as soon as he is seven years old; and then if he
will come to a proper schoolmaster, I will come over myself and
bring him up, if he will not come without me. As for your son,
you will do what is best; and I wish that the young wench
may be brought up in the way of virtue, that she may know what
she doth, that, for fear of God's anger, you may save yourself
and your family; and let your son be brought up as I have
said."

"It was a merry thought," said the gentleman, "to let
this good fellow sit here."

"It was for that purpose," said Tom, "I asked him if
he would sit in it."

"Well," said the stranger, "thou shalt not repent of
what thou hast done. Only be sure that thou hast a good
master, if he should be found to teach the young man ill. But
have you no more good advice to give us?"

"Yes," said Tom, "since I have told you that my own
boy was too bad till he was six-and-thirty years old, and that
I would take him out of the way myself; and that when your son
is found to be too bad, you may put him out of the way in
like manner. As for your son, I would advise you to take him
into the road with you when you go to supper to-night; and
though he may be very troublesome when you carry him to the
house, yet let him play with the other children, till he comes
to the place where you carry him to supper. Do not make him
hurt the cattle, nor do any mischief, for the children will
learn to do so; and then when he comes to follow you home, he
will be able to take care of his own meat, which will be
better for him than eating up that which you have provided for
you and your family. And do you, friend, as I have done,
take him to the priest when he is six years old, and so the
young man may be taught the way of virtue. And then it will be
easier to persuade him, when he comes to be twenty, to learn
any art or mystery."

"And do you think, friend," said the stranger, "that
when he comes to be thirty years old, he will be grown too old
for instruction?"

"Do not you see," said Tom, "that I say what is too
good for a boy till he be six-and-thirty? And as I said before,
it was my father that told me so, and he was so sensible of it
that he used to call his son a child till he was six-and-six;
and it was at six-and-six that I was made a man. And now,
friends, I can only make a boy wise, and my father's son</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:22
