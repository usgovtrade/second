The album was a solid, well-structured blend of pop and folk-tinged music which has proved to be a commercial success as well as an artistic and critical success. We are thrilled that the album is nominated for three Grammy Awards: Best Folk Album, Best Americana Album, and Best Roots Song.

“Our mission is to craft albums that stand up to repeated listens, and “Trouble” accomplishes just that. Some of the songs on this album sound like they came straight from American roots music, while others sound like completely original pop songs. The truth is, they’re both. It’s hard to define a pop song that really fits us, so the way we see it is that our strength is in our songs. We make those sounds.” — Daniel Bachman

“This is an album by the young band that we were three years ago and we loved so much. It’s really beautiful and has so much vitality.” – Daniel Bachman

“I’m just amazed at how well we’re able to mesh our traditional songs with this really great music and have it not feel so out of place.” – Ben Platt

“It’s amazing how many songs it took for us to discover who we really are. But what a journey. The songs on this album represent our life more than anything else we’ve ever done.” – Ben Platt

“It was a long, grueling journey and we didn’t know if we would ever get here. To be able to share this in the midst of everything going on was more than we could ever have imagined.” – Ben Platt

“The best of what we have to offer in the purest, truest form. And as I said, it’s all from the heart, everything we sing is from the inside.” – Ben Platt

“It’s the sound that we’re going for in this band. These songs are the purest, most honest expression of who we are.” – Ben Platt

The band is nominated for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album, Best Roots Gospel Album, and Best Americana Album for their recording and tour performances. The four musicians have each received GRAMMY Awards.

Ben Platt has received two GRAMMY Awards, one for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance (co-nominee) for “Pieces of Me” from Dear Evan Hansen, and one for Best Contemporary R&B Album for Something New from This Is Acting.

Ben Platt has released his debut studio album, Sing To Me Instead, in October 2015. This past December, Ben Platt released a new version of “Pieces of Me” from Dear Evan Hansen as a piano ballad and reached #1 on the Billboard Classical chart.

Platt was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance in The Last Ship and received two Drama Desk Award nominations for his work in Dear Evan Hansen and This Is Acting. In 2017, he released his second album of standards, Be More Kind, with proceeds benefitting Reverb and its mission to build instruments for schools and youth in Africa.

Betsy Wolfe received her Bachelor’s Degree in Theatre Arts from the University of Utah, where she also received a Musical Theatre Writing Certificate. Her music has been featured on the NBC game show The Wall, and she was a finalist on the reality show America’s Most Talented Kid on the Disney Channel.

Kelsea Ballerini has released seven singles, four studio albums, one live album, and 15 official music videos, including “Legends” from her multi-platinum debut, The First Time, her highest charting single to date. She has performed more than 1,400 shows, including headlining amphitheater and arena shows.
