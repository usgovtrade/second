"I'm going home and eating me a nice piece of pie." "Get out." "What?" "What did you just say?" "About what?" "About the pie?" "Get out." "No, about me." "Why don't you get out?" "Well, I was wondering if maybe you were talking about me." "Like that?" "No, like more like this." "Well, that's exactly what I meant, and we are talking about you now, you fat piece of crap." "Get out of here." "Just go." "All right." "I said, get out." "And I said to get out." "And I said, I said to get out!" "And again!" "I'll be at the bus stop!" "Hey, you better get home." "It's not safe out here." "You ought to give up on me." "No way." "I've got a big day ahead of me." "I don't want to even think about what you could be doing right now to your face." "I can't wait to get to sleep tonight." "Maybe I should take the bus." "Maybe I shouldn't be walking." "I can't believe I'm in this neighborhood." "This is the most dangerous part of town." "I'm sure there's somebody walking around here who ought to be dead by now." "It looks safe enough." "Well, it's not safe enough for me." "Wait up." "Wait up!" "What are you doing?" "You know, the more I look at you, the more I can't believe my luck." "Look at this place." "It's awful nice for us." "I'm not looking for us." "They're closing in on you." "I got a plan B." "Why don't we just go into the house?" "I got a gun in there." "You got a gun?" "What are you doing with a gun?" "Oh, I've had it for a long time." "I got lots of things in the house." "Okay." "Okay?" "Come on." "Hey, you're going the wrong way." "Where you going?" "The door is back that way." "Okay, then we go through the front?" "All right." "Come on." "What are you doing?" "It's a stick." "You're supposed to put stuff in here." "Is it loaded?" "No, just bullets." "I wish I had one right now." "Wait, wait, wait!" "Don't shoot me!" "Get off of me!" "What do you think you're doing?" "She told me she wanted me to kill her with this." "I didn't know she was going to do it right here in the back of my apartment!" "She told me she'd rather be dead than go back to jail." "I can't deal with this!" "I'm a good man!" "Please!" "No." "No." "Just wait." "I had nothing to do with this!" "I mean, I'm not the one who gave you the gun." "Look, I don't need to be here right now." "Why don't we just talk this out?" "Don't hurt him." "I wasn't planning to, but we can talk about this." "Hey, hey, hey." "Please." "Please, I've been on the streets all day." "Okay, I don't want to hurt anyone." "That's why I got the gun." "It's just because you had a gun and he didn't, and..." "But he was going to do it, and I didn't have a choice." "And if you had a gun, he would've shot you." "If you didn't have a gun, he would have shot me." "Who are you talking about?" "Who?" "Who are you talking about?" "Oh, shit." "My bad." "My bad." "I didn't mean to hurt anyone." "I'm really sorry." "You better be telling me the truth." "Please, just don't shoot me." "Just don't shoot me." "I can get you a gun." "Come on, let's go." "Yeah, right." "Just like that, huh?" "He's got a gun." "We've gotta go in there." "Yeah, well, I can't." "Look, you don't want to do it, fine with me." "But I can't let you walk in there and do it either." "So how about you just get off my case?" "Okay?" "You've got a gun, too, okay?" "You've got a gun." "That means you've got a choice." "You could help me out or you could just walk away." "No, please." "No." "What are you doing?" "I'm just gonna go and get my stuff, and then I'll be out of your way." "No, you're not going anywhere." "This is my fight." "This is your fight?" "What's your plan?" "To try and talk to these people." "And tell them why we're here, what we want." "I'm sorry." "What's the plan?" "Plan?" "Oh, we're just gonna stand here and try and reason with them." "Oh, that's a great plan." "That's the plan?" "Yes." "What about a gun?" "These people are armed." "I have a gun." "Hey, what about me?" "Hey, what about us?" "You know, you just take all the time you want." "I'm just gonna go get my stuff and get out of here." "Okay?" "Okay." "You know, this way you can tell them we were unarmed." "If you leave now, there's no telling what they'll do." "Well, if I stay here, there's no telling what they're going to do to me." "You have to." "I don't have to do anything." "Yes, you do." "Look, maybe you're the big brave one, but I'm not." "So I'm leaving." "Are you coming or am I leaving?" "It's up to you." "No, it's up to you." "You go in there and I'll stay right here." "Well, it's better than me just standing here, isn't it?" "All right." "Just give me a second." "Just wait here." "Wait for what?" "Just wait here." "Hold on." "Hey, listen." "Don't make any sudden moves or they'll shoot you." "If you can get them to come out here, come out and bring them over, I'll take them down." "Oh, you will?" "Yes." "Like with one shot, right?" "No, like with one shot." "Okay." "Okay?" "Okay." "All right, let's get this show on the road." "All right, I'm going in." "But I'm going to wait until I hear you start shooting, then I'm gonna go in." "No, wait, wait." "Let's just wait a second." "You could still shoot me from out here, right?" "I mean, you've got a clear shot, right?" "You'll be fine." "Okay." "Yeah." "Thank you for helping me out, okay?" "Sure." "Can you pass me those keys?" "I need the keys." "Why?" "Well, I don't have my car anymore." "I gave it to these guys, okay?" "And they told me if I didn't drive it across this street right now that they're gonna shoot me." "What's the matter?" "You don't think I can shoot, do you?" "So why don't you just give me the keys, okay?" "I'm not joking, I'm really not joking." "Give me the keys." "Look, I have to have the keys." "I'm not kidding." "I'm not kidding." "Look, maybe you're the big brave one, but I'm not." "So I'm leaving." "Come on." "Come on." "Thank you, thank you." "Come on." "Let's go." "Did you do it?" "Did you shoot her?" "No." "Not yet." "You see?" "I'm waiting for you." "But the thing is, I didn't really want to shoot her." "She told me she didn't want to shoot me, either." "Do you think I should have shot her?" "She didn't shoot me, did she?" "Well, technically, she did, but only because she thought you were going to shoot me." "Really?" "I think it was pretty obvious I wasn't going to shoot her." "She was clearly just trying to protect me." "Maybe." "I just don't know what to think, that's all." "Me, neither." "I mean, it all happened so fast, and she was just trying to help me." "Okay, maybe she was trying to protect me, but then why did she come over here like that?" "You don't think she's kind of weird, do you?" "No." "No way." "I mean, look at her, she's absolutely gorgeous." "Did you see her ass?" "What?" "You don't want to know what I'm talking about." "Come on</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:35
