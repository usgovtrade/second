"They gave me something to eat." "They put me to bed." "And they waited for me to wake up, what was left of me." "I told you you were next." "I was." "We both were." "What's he looking at?" "So..." "What are you, anyway?" "I'm..." "He asked you a question." "This is not your story." "That's not yours either." "Are you an assassin?" "Well, that depends on who's asking." "It's just like he says." "He's going to fight a bear, but he has to have something to fight." "And something to fight with." "He doesn't know what it is yet or who it is." "Why does it matter?" "How are you in the woods?" "Are you hunting?" "Where are you coming from?" "How did he get there?" "The last time I got taken from the bottom of the stairs, right?" "This guy is still light." "He's getting better, getting stronger." "You're going to need a pretty good memory to remember what he can do." "Not all of it." "They put me in a closet because I put the fire out." "I don't know how long I was there, but I remember it was a Saturday." "I..." "I think I stayed in the closet all night." "They must have brought me something to eat or something." "Yeah, that was probably it." "So, anyway..." "I don't know why you want to go back to the beach or what you're looking for, but I figure, from now on," "you'll tell me the plan, right?" "Yeah." "Plan." "To get back to town." "There's been some trouble." "We're going to go to a diner on the edge of town." "And then go to Cyril's diner." "He'll know what to do." "I need the lights and the heat." "Hey." "Hey, your fire is out." "And you know what?" "I think we can get you some new ones over at the hardware store." "And the heat in this place, you're going to have to find a new supplier." "Hey, did you ever..." "I need that coat." "The coat you took off." "Did you ever give it to Goodwill?" "I don't remember a coat." "All right, all right, all right, where's Cyril?" "Now, you don't remember what he looks like either?" "Well, that coat will fit him." "Right, but when I was there before, did you tell me he was sitting right there in the corner?" "Okay." "I told you once." "It came down to me." "What are we going to do now?" "We're going to go back in the kitchen, find what's left of the old man and try to figure out who put him in the box." "And who put him in the freezer." "And who put him in the diner." "Come on, get up." "Get up." "I'm okay." "The heater broke." "My feet are cold." "Where's your father?" "He doesn't have much time." "Do you remember the guy we were talking to at the gas station before?" "His car ran out of gas." "Yeah, I guess so." "You sure?" "Yeah, I think so." "He was wearing a hat." "What kind of hat?" "A brown hat, I think." "Okay, well, he gave me a ride." "And he dropped you off here?" "I guess so." "Okay, okay, forget it." "Okay, sit down." "I need a coat." "No one was here?" "Just me." "Okay, look." "What if the same guy comes back?" "What do I do then?" "I don't know, just let me think." "Okay, let me think." "Did you find what you were looking for?" "No, not yet." "I haven't heard from Jack or Jim." "They're up to something." "What kind of something?" "I don't know what, but it isn't good." "Okay, thanks." "And you're sure you're okay?" "Yeah." "No, no message." "No message." "How do we know this is going to work?" "Well, we don't, but it's better than sitting around here waiting for something else to happen." "This is what's going to happen." "We're gonna find out exactly what the old man meant by "the last time."" "Then we're going to go back in the woods and bury the body." "And we're going to bury it the right way, not like some half-assed operation." "Where are we going to get a shovel?" "The old man's got plenty of stuff." "Okay, good." "The old man." "Not so good." "We had one thing in our favor." "He can't see that his own car has run out of gas." "You know, it's funny." "What?" "I never thought about this." "I forgot that you didn't know anything about the last time." "So, what's going to happen when we get home?" "You don't know." "Don't you ever wonder about your future?" "I've thought about it." "You want to be an artist, right?" "Maybe write books." "Yeah." "You and me, we're going to be artists." "And we're going to be partners." "Maybe we're going to be partners in an art gallery or a book store or whatever we want." "I don't want to think about it too much." "Let's just enjoy today." "What the hell's going on?" "Hey, what's going on?" "Stay down." "You're being paranoid." "You are paranoid." "What are you going to do?" "Shoot us?" "Hey, get off me." "Hey, get off me." "Cops." "Don't look." "Don't look, don't look." "There are more of them over there." "Okay, where'd they go?" "I can see there are more of them over there, and the one who was talking to me is heading back this way." "Cops are coming." "Okay, we have to go back and find that hole in the fence." "But why would he let you in here?" "Because they're not looking for a boy." "We need to get this guy out of here." "He's all we got." "This is our boy." "They've been coming to our house." "This is it, all right." "Yeah." "What do you think, we're the first ones to think of this?" "You told me that you had a plan and that we were going to get some help." "Look, I'm trying to keep you alive." "That's what I'm doing." "It doesn't matter what I want." "You'll have to deal with them yourself." "Are you sure there's only one?" "There are two now." "One of them had a shotgun." "All right, we need to find out what happened here today." "No one saw anything." "I saw them shooting at the house." "I heard them." "Come on, come on." "The cops were here." "They were shooting at the house, trying to hit me." "At me and my father." "What were they doing?" "What were they doing here?" "I don't know." "My dad took me and we came here and we hid behind the wall." "Okay, well, let's start with what you know." "You remember which way you came?" "You remember where you came from?" "No, we came from the gas station." "It's pretty messed up, huh?" "Yeah, pretty messed up." "I was looking for a job." "And they brought me here because I can..." "I can lift things and I can run fast." "How much do you think a whole coat would cost?" "You can have the coat." "Did you see what happened to my dad?" "I know he had a heart attack." "You don't know anything about that." "Okay, okay, come here." "Come on, we're going." "Okay, come on." "We're going, come on." "Okay, come on, let's go." "Where do you think you're going?" "I'm gonna get your dad." "We were together all the time, and I didn't want to be without him." "He said if you were with me, he'd be safe." "I'm going to get him and I'm going to bring him back." "What are you talking about?" "I thought you were trying to stop me from going back in the woods." "I was just trying to keep you from getting yourself killed." "He said that if I could do it and make it out alive, then I would know he was still alive." "He said that he wasn't dead yet and that he'd tell me when I knew." "What are you doing?" "No." "No, no, you can't." "You can't." "I need you to stay here and help me get him." "You can't go back there." "There's no telling what you're going to find." "He's not</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:36
