Lopez was among the first to be honored by MTV, appearing on the network’s famous music awards show in 1992 as the first artist with a Spanish-language record to receive the Video Vanguard Award. That same year, Lopez married a Cuban-American businessman, Ojani Noa, after just two months of dating.

When she came out as a lesbian after the birth of her son, J-Lo became the first Latina to star in a prime time series and the first openly LGBTQ celebrity, earning the title role on “Marcelo” (ABC, 2017), about a trans teenager transitioning to life as a young woman.

Lopez has worked with a variety of top entertainment figures over her five-decade career, from legendary producer and entertainment magnate Phil Spector to Jennifer Lopez’s father, Guillermo.

She has had several business ventures. She partnered with Apple in the past to create her own app for children, while she’s co-hosted NBC’s “World of Dance” since 2017 and founded O.N.E. Touring, which provides tour support to new artists who want to promote their talent. Lopez is known for her philanthropic work; she has hosted and headlined events for AIDS charities, such as Elton John AIDS Foundation, since 2011.

She was one of the artists participating in Time’s Up, an initiative founded by Hollywood’s most prominent women to fight sexual harassment, and is part of Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which offers legal support for people facing workplace discrimination.
