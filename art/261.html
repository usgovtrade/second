The iced coffees are served in a 12 oz. glass and filled with 4â€“6oz. of ice and flavored with everything from fruit to caramel to cocoa. Flavors range from Pistachio, Cappuccino, Mint, Lemonade, and Almond Roca, and come with the choice of a whipped or unwhipped dairy or non-dairy creamer.

The company said it would focus its business efforts on its core competencies: its innovative products, ability to drive sales in the bar, restaurant, and hotel industries, ability to leverage its brands in new geographic areas and through new channels. On January 26, 2012, DICKS 'N DRINKS closed seven of its 14 cafes for its "Bar to Bar" campaign. In March, the Bar to Bar campaign was shortened to three hours in the morning and three hours in the evening.

On November 1, 2012, DICKS 'N DRINKS announced that it would return 1-for-1 ice cream to U.S. Dairy Queen locations, as Dairy Queen's parent company has decided to cut back on DICKS 'N DRINKS products from its restaurants. DICKS 'N DRINKS' ice cream is currently sold in 15% of the chain's stores.

DICKS 'N DRINKS announced on May 28, 2013, that it was going to end the sale of its frozen yogurt in two months. The company cited competition from Dairy Queen and the success of the company's Ice Cream Bars. At the time of its closure, DICKS 'N DRINKS had 14 cafes in the United States and a distribution network that reached 17,000 restaurant locations and 1,200 retail outlets. The company announced its closure two months later, after DICKS 'N DRINKS announced that it would return Dairy Queen's ice cream and would discontinue its frozen yogurt. DICKS 'N DRINKS announced the sale of its frozen yogurt to Ben & Jerry's in May 2014.
