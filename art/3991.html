... we must consider the very real possibility that he could end up being blamed for his party’s losses. And right now, that is the very last thing he needs.

That isn't such a small possibility when you consider the last time they had to deal with a lame duck president in January 2010, where the Democrats lost a whopping 63 seats in Congress and the presidency.

This time, Democrats are going into this with a more vulnerable president, who is facing the largest corruption scandal in his administration.

And while Trump and Republicans were already bracing for Democrats to take back the House, the fact that they could still take the Senate is a huge worry for Republicans.

And there is a very real fear that "Democrats can take this opportunity to put a stake through the heart of Trump’s agenda, making the midterm elections much more than just about Trump," as noted by CNN.

The CNN contributor said, "I have long worried about Donald Trump making off-the-cuff deals with Democrats, that he thinks he can’t do without; this is one of those cases where he may find out he has made a horrible miscalculation."

And they just might — if they don't get their act together and realize that they have a lot more to lose than they have to gain.

And if that's the case, the Democrats should just make sure they don't take away his Christmas wish for a second term.

As one CNN contributor put it, "I can’t imagine how Democrats let this opportunity go. This is an incredible chance to rebrand the party and bring people back into their fold. But this is a huge mistake if it is not what the base is really wanting."

The question now is whether the Democrats will learn from their mistake and realize that their best way to be re-elected is by actually doing the work they were elected to do.

And if they fail to do so, the American people will see through them, and they will get more political payback than they bargained for.
