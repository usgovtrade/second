I think the ending was a little anti-climatic, but that was the only part of the story that was slightly disappointing. To me it all felt in keeping with the story's theme and the ending was a lovely way to wrap up an enticing, enchanting tale. If you love books with a little kick, this is definitely for you.

I have no idea who to give this to, so I'll give it to a random person.

This is one of my favorite books! I adored it! This book is just wonderful! I read a lot of stories about witches or magic or paranormal stuff, but this was one that was believable. It was entertaining and had great character development. I love the main character and her love for her family and the ending! I was shocked to see how the author continued the story line, even though I wasn't sure if the ending would be at the ending of the book or not, but I was happy she did, even though I was a little disappointed. I am so happy that I found this book! I would rate this book as a must-read! I also plan to read the next two books in this series and also one I have purchased on my Kindle. I give this book 5 stars!

This book was really good. I really like the theme of not following the rules. The only thing was I felt like the ending was a little too long to wrap it up but it was very good. The ending for me wasn't in keeping with the book, but it wasn't bad. It was different. It gave you a more in depth look into the character's background. But if you like books like Harry Potter you would like this book. If you are a Harry Potter fan then you should read this, since it is written very similar to it. So if you are a Harry Potter fan then I definitely recommend this book.

As soon as I read the summary, I knew I would love this book! My daughter came home from school and mentioned there was this book she would like to get me as a Christmas present, and she wanted to know if I had already read it? I told her no, and she went off to get me this book... The best buy gift ever! This book was fantastic! I can't wait to read the next book!

I read this book for a book club, and enjoyed the story. It's a little less of a paranormal story, and more of an historical novel. I think that makes it unique. I was somewhat frustrated that I couldn't figure out who the antagonist was, because I wanted more explanation. The ending is a little weird, and I didn't understand what was going on for the rest of the last few pages. I'm going to give it 3 stars because I loved the first book and I thought that there was some promise there.

I love everything about this book. I don't even know where to start because there's so much I like about it! The concept is original and interesting (witches, magic, paranormal, and ghosts) and there's an awesome story. I really like the plot of this book and the fact that they take it and end it at a different point. I liked the narrator a lot and the characters had a lot of character traits. At first I was a little hesitant about this book because of the summary and the picture. But after I started reading I immediately got into it and was fully into it and looking forward to reading more. I recommend it for fans of paranormal literature and romance in general.

I didn't like this book. I think it's a great concept and story, but not well told. The pacing is very slow, and the writing takes away from what could have been a great story. I really wish I hadn't bought this book and then read the first two stories of the series. They should not be read out of order.

While this book didn't wow me, it is a good read. If you're in the mood for a good book, this would be a good pick. While the story isn't totally original, it was still an interesting read. With that being said, it does take a little while to get into the story, and I found myself skimming over a few chapters before I had enough to finish the story. In the end, this book is a good way to kill a few hours.

I have read all three in this series and this one was my favorite. After this one, the next one was not as good so I will not be continuing the series. They're were just to many unanswered questions and too many of them were not believable.

I think that the writers of this series should have ended with the first book and not try to tie in any stories past that. It's like she decided to write something completely different from what she first described. I liked the main character. She was a good narrator to follow the books.

The story starts off interesting enough and I liked how it progressed. I think it became monotonous when it comes to the characters. There wasn't really anything that grabbed my attention. I won't be reading the next books of the series. I think that the story starts off interesting enough but once it comes to the end, there wasn't anything that was good about it and there was no ending at all. There was just a dead end. I think I could have stopped there but there wasn't really anything interesting or good about it.

I really liked this book! This was a great read and I look forward to reading more from this author!

This book was so good! I loved it so much I'm going to try and read all of the sequels to see if they're as good!

The plot is interesting and unique, it was like there was no one else who could write a book about it. But it didn't make me feel like the characters could exist in real life. But I do love the fact that the writer makes some things up or adds fictional facts to it, that makes it even more interesting!

It was good I liked it the story is interesting and I love the cover. It looks interesting and I think the cover fits the story. It is hard to get me into a book when it's not a genre I normally read, but the story here is captivating, I read this book just for curiosity sake since it had a lot of hype around it but I don't regret buying it.

This book was great! I'd highly recommend it, especially for fans of paranormal, romance, fantasy. I'll be rereading this one for sure!

The title of this book is a bit misleading. This is not really about a witch but rather a very curious witch. What was interesting about the book is that most of it takes place in two different time periods. The book starts off in the modern day. The main character is a 15 year old witch who can control things with her mind. Through her curiosity she accidentally teleports herself back in time. The only way she can return to her time is to find a witch who has the same abilities. There was a lot of good suspense and action as the story progresses. I liked this book because I never knew what was going to happen next. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it because of the subject matter, but it really kept me interested. I thought the narrator was pretty good. Some parts were a little too dramatic, but overall a good listen!

I really enjoyed</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:13
