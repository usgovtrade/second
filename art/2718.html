You may pick a second person, or one of the final two, at your next two Tribals.

The Jury - You can pick one member from the jury at Tribal Council.
This means you can pick either one of the final two - since you can't pick the jury as your final pick, which means only one person can be picked by you.

Chick Voting: When voting against one member of the opposite tribe, that individual becomes a threat to vote off that person. The threat is then eliminated.
When voting for someone from the opposite tribe, you can also choose to play a "chick" strategy, which is where you do everything to get that person out, with the exception of getting voted off themselves. This is a very dangerous strategy, since the person you are trying to eliminate might be a better choice than the person you are saving. There's no point in letting a threat hang around. But, if you're careful, you can do very well with it.

The Immunity Challenge:

When someone wins an Immunity Challenge, they pick two people from their losing tribe, and send them to a fire.
For every immunity win, the loser of the challenge takes one vote from the tribe.
For every immunity win, the winner of the challenge takes one vote from the opposing tribe.
For every immunity win, a third vote is taken from the losing tribe and added to the tribe that they lost against.

Immunity Challenge #2 -

Everyone has a chance to get Immunity by winning a challenge for the person who took Immunity in the last challenge.

The Final Five:

Here, there are two possible outcomes.
The first is that the final two (or three) form the new Kumba team.
The second is that the three remaining people form the former Kumba team, and the two remaining people form the other remaining tribe.

Spoiler for Results:

The final two are

Chris (Kumba Tribe)
Tyson (Buhimba Tribe)

Chris: the winner. With Tyson as his best friend, it might be hard for him to lose to the other one, even though Tyson might think he should.

The Final Two Tribes:

Each pairing gets a starting tribe of 10 members.
