  The little ones went to bed
  With heavy, heavy hearts,
  For there was no one now,
  To make the "snow" for them.

  Their mother lay so still,
  A silent sleep had come;
  She had done all she could,
  Now let her work be done;
  That it would be all right,
  And all they had to do,
  Was to fold their hands
  And go to sleep in peace.

  But hark! what sound was that,
  Just on the edge of hearing?
  Was it really so--
  Or were they dreaming so?
  Just what was in their mind,
  We cannot tell--
  Their mothers who are dead,
  But surely none can tell!

  That sound so faint and far
  Made those children sad and low;
  But soon their fears were gone,
  They knew their mother had not died.
  She was singing "snow"!

       *       *       *       *       *

 The children heard the voice,
  Which fell from out the skies;
  And then they thought and saw,
  A lovely lovely sight;
  The little girls in white,
  The little boys in black,
  All singing like the snow;

 And round and round the home,
 The children there were seen.

 For the snow was falling fast,
 And every one did come,
 And the sound of happy voices,
  Was like a "sleigh-bell" in the air.

 The little children laughed,
 As they went out to play,
  And then they seemed to know
 Just how it should be done:

 For they were so happy and gay,
  With every one so good and true,
  That all the snows that ever fell,
  Could never make them sad;

 And when their hearts were light,
 And nothing sad would come,
  They seemed to know that God,
  He had the children in his mind;

 And on that day when first
 He made them, still the same,
 To fill this world with snow,
 And make the world a heaven.

 Oh may the little children,
 That you have loved so well,
  That you will always have
 Upon this earth, some time.

 And may your love and your care,
 Be with them through the years;
  No power on earth can take
 Their love away.

 For once a thing is begun,
 It will not end in pain;

 And may they never know
 That "snow" that you have sung for them;

 Or only in a dream,
 That they will never quite believe.

 And when the winter passes,
 Like summer in a burst;

 And when their summer days
 Are all too short to stay;

 And all too soon their joys
 Will all too soon be o'er;

 And when your song is sung,
 And it has reached its end;

 May the angels sing,
 Your praises all the while,
 And may you never know
 What your pure white snows have done.




ALEXANDER

  You ask me of my pleasure and of my
      sorrow,
    And then you leave me quite alone;
  Oh, would that I were strong enough to tell you,
    and tell you!
    But who can tell the agony and the joy?

  I've given what my heart has ached to give,
    O dear my comrade, all for me;
  And now I've learned it was not quite for me,
    but for you--
    That God took all my strength away from me.

  O Christ! when I shall wake from out this sleep,
    And find your smile across the sea,
    May I be dumb at length for love of you,
    For only now I know
    My life was given to you, and you were mine.




THOMAS A. GORDON
(1827-1885)


GORDON was born near Boston. When he was five years old his father
moved to New York, taking up his residence in New York city. There the
boy soon discovered the public school of that city and the Sunday
School. His father and uncle were the first Sunday School missionaries
in New York, the former teaching at the Church of the Pilgrims and
uncle Samuel, at Tammany Hall. Young Gordon was among the first to
take up the work. By the age of twelve the boy was in the regular
Sunday School at Trinity, preaching at the pulpit for the first time
to some six hundred people. He then entered the College of the City of
New York, and was taught by Dr. Samuel F. Schoellkopf. There he met
his future wife, Miss Julia E. P. Smith. In 1853 Mr. and Mrs. Gordon
went abroad and attended the London Conference, and also the
celebrated Edinburgh Missionary conference, which set on foot the
Missionary Training School at Fisk University, to which the Gordons
returned to accept the presidency. In 1862 Mr. Gordon was appointed to
work among the <DW64>s in Tennessee. In 1867 he joined the Southern
Missionary Society, and was then sent to Georgia, where he served at
Rome, Augusta, Macon, and Savannah. For three years he also attended
classes at Atlanta University. At this time he first felt called to the
work in Africa, and went to West Africa, where he was engaged in
mission work until 1881, when ill health compelled him to resign. In
1884 he and his wife returned to the United States and made their home
in Brooklyn, where he was much engaged in the educational and
philanthropic work. Mr. Gordon was president of the Executive Board of
the American Baptist Publication Society, and also of the Foreign
Mission Board of the American Baptist Home Mission Society.


GOING TO EGYPT

One year from this day, the 29th of August, 1882, I sailed from New
York with my wife and baby, on the steamship _Kenesaw_, a small and
not very comfortable vessel, bound for Cairo, Egypt, where I had
previously arranged for a three years' mission for which an earnest
wish had been burning in my soul for twenty-five years. At Cairo I was
accompanied by my son-in-law, Mr. R. H. Fulton, and my daughter, Miss
Alice C. Fulton, of Brooklyn.

We landed in Alexandria on the 13th of September, and after some
necessary delay, were started by train on our long trip from Alexandria
to Assouan, where the _Kenesaw_ lay at anchor in the beautiful waters
of the Upper Nile, four hundred miles from Cairo. Assouan was our last
stop in Egypt and, as far as we were concerned, our first in Africa.
For the three days we lay at Assouan we enjoyed perfect health, and
were blessed with one of those delightful nights of pure air in the
ocean of freshness and beauty that we experienced at times during our
sojourn in Egypt.

The next day Mr. Fulton went to Assiout and arranged for a little
household belonging to his father, and Mrs. Fulton with my daughter
moved into that dwelling and took charge of the establishment of the
Mission, which they called "Marietta." Their place of residence at
Assiout is called "Assiout station," or simply "Assiout."

I went on with my companion, Mr. Wm. F. Young, and we soon reached
Kawa, where the _Kenesaw_ was ready to start for Khartoum. From that
time we did not meet a great many white people during our travels,
because all of them were going to the same place. The natives were
friendly. They came to see us, brought presents and wished us "good
health" and blessings, for they are great lovers of Christian people,
especially of the missionaries, whom they say "make the world better."
But the only thing they need to do, to make the world better is to
teach the whites a little better how to live.


MY LADY OF THE LAND

We reached Khartoum on the 11th of October, 1882, and began to make
preparations for the long journey across the desert to Omdurman. The
first night was one of rest and quiet sleep; the second we spent in
carrying our things on camels and preparing for the great adventure of
carrying them into Africa, on one camel, three hundred and
seventy-five miles from Khartoum. We left Khartoum on Friday morning
at 5.30 o'clock, having received word at Khartoum that the Khalifa,
Mohammed Ahmed, was on his way to Omdurman with his army. It was then
rumored that the war which had been threatened would probably be
resumed.


THE OIL OF BREAD

From my boyhood I had been taught about the prophet Mohammed, and had
also heard that there was something in his teachings not wholly good.
