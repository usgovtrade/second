Our History

Wills & Deed Records has served the legal community for over 20 years in the Northern Georgia area.

We are family owned and have been in business since 1991. We are located in Covington, Georgia, which is approximately 15 miles South of Atlanta, Georgia. We currently have over 700 titles in our database and have made thousands of copies. We keep accurate track of changes in ownership. We do, however, make mistakes and you may not always get a copy of a recorded document that someone has given to us.

We also have the ability to mail any document from our office for a minimal fee of $1.50 per document. We currently only mail between the State of Georgia and the United States.

We have recently received a request from one of our clients to do some printing for them. They were given a price that was substantially more than we charge, so we have chosen to no longer do any printing on our website. If you have any questions about any documents that you have from us, please don't hesitate to call us. Thank you for your interest.

* We also offer an online web site for your firm to advertise your service and to provide information and forms to download for your customers. Please contact us for more information.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:45
