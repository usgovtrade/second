Caught in a bad situation? You've come to the right place, baby! A new blog is the new hotness. Just like your new hair color, your new shoes, and that awesome tattoo you got yesterday, a new blog is a must. It shows people that you have gone out on a limb and are willing to try something new. It's a bold statement that says, "I care enough to keep up with the times." So say "hello" to our new blog format with this weeks feature: Tube Town.

You may think that I’m some kind of weird-o, but I like getting up before the sun is even peeking. I know that sounds crazy and like I’m getting up at sunrise. That’s not what I’m talking about though. When I got my first job out of college I was used to being woken up by an alarm clock on Sundays morning. That was all good, until the Sunday paper came out. With my alarm clock job I could sleep in until the very last minute (as long as I had my coffee waiting for me, and the Sunday paper). A normal day of waking up before the rest of my family was not something that I did very often. At first I thought, “What is this whole sunrise thing?” Now that I live with my girlfriend she wakes up way earlier than that, and it’s actually become quite the awesome thing to do. I love sleeping in and waking up at a time that is convenient for me and my whole family. We wake up and it feels like it’s still night. We walk downstairs and it still feels as if we’re walking into a museum. We open the door and go outside and it’s like we’re walking out of a cave. It’s cool. This blog is dedicated to helping you all love that feeling. If you’re looking for some kind of motivation, then it’s time for a change.

In the past week I have experienced the benefits of making a change, and even though I’m not telling you to run off to become a cave dweller, it’s nice to see that it works. It’s about time you started living your life to the fullest and doing all of the things you love. You may be someone who sits in their bed for hours until it’s time to wake up. I know that is something I used to do a lot, but there is no reason for that. That needs to change. Every single day I wake up at 6:30 in the morning, no matter what day it is. That's how much I love my life. The time that we spend sleeping and sleeping should be used for waking up. We should be awake and ready to get to where we are going, instead of walking down our paths like zombies.

I will never understand why people hate waking up early. If you don’t, then that’s fine with me. That’s your problem, not mine. Why would you want to waste time doing something that you hate? The time that you spend sleeping is a huge waste. You could be doing something productive with that time, like eating or sleeping or whatever else you have to do. I don’t know about you, but sleeping is the best thing that I can do. That is what I love doing, so it’s important to take advantage of the time you are spending awake. All you have to do is wake up before everyone else in your house and you’ll feel a ton better.

If waking up in the morning sounds a lot better than your current situation, then it’s time to do it. You can start by waking up early to wake everyone up for work or school, or you can find a reason to wake up early. My girlfriend will sometimes wake up before anyone else and give me a reason for doing so.

If you’re ready to make the switch, then check out this link and you will see what I’m talking about! I’m going to go back to sleep. (That’s just a figure of speech. I like sleeping. Now back to the article at hand.)

Well, I’m done. I hope that you’ve found what you were looking for and have some new information on how to change something in your life for the better. My mission is accomplished, so I’m going to go back to work.
