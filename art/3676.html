There’s no denying the benefits you can achieve from exercising and getting your body in shape.

That said, if you’re going to go the route of training to fight, or even just train to get in better shape and improve your performance, here are 5 Tips that can help you succeed.

Let Your Body Do What It Needs To Do

Training will make you sore. You’ll sweat your ass off. You’ll be constantly feeling and seeing improvements. This is absolutely normal and expected.

But it’s also perfectly normal for that same body to start letting you know that it needs more rest. As your body gets stronger and things start to change, it might be telling you that you need more sleep, a better diet, or a change in how you’re training.

If you start feeling and seeing improvements, but suddenly things are not feeling quite right, pay attention to your body’s needs. If you don’t take the time to listen to it, it will continue to let you know when it needs something else. The problem is that you might not be sure what it needs until it’s too late and you’re in worse shape than when you started.

Always Make Sure Your Mind Is In It Too

We say this all the time, but I’ve never been a big fan of thinking too much during training. Some people are natural-born planners who love to be organized and always know exactly what they are going to do before they get started. But for me, a lot of times I’ll get out there, figure out what I am going to do, and forget everything. I usually try to be aware of this and just go with the flow.

But the point of this is that you need to be sure that your mind is in the game too. You need to make sure that you’re not thinking about what’s going on at home or at work or in any other part of your life that could get in the way of being successful. You need to be thinking about what you are going to do, not what you shouldn’t be doing.

Always Know How To Recover

This might seem like a no-brainer, but just think about it for a second. If you always know how to recover, and if you keep yourself in good shape and maintain a positive attitude, then you are basically “practicing” how you will be the successful fighter.

When you’re not recovering properly, then you’re constantly putting yourself at risk and are likely going to fail as a fighter when it comes time for competition. This is basically a win-win scenario.

Always Be In The Zone

In my opinion, this is the single most important piece of advice you can follow. You need to be able to find your zone, and you need to be able to keep yourself in that zone for a long time.

I’m sure you have heard that fighters do their best work when they get in the zone. The same goes for people who are athletes in general.

You can get in the zone by keeping your mind focused on the job at hand. This might be through keeping your mind focused on what your plan of attack is in a fight, or it might be through doing something that you know how to do well and keeps you in the zone for a period of time.

This is something that can be developed through focus and practice. As long as you have an idea of what you need to do and a plan for how you can do it, then you should be all set.

Take It One Minute At A Time

This is more of a “keep yourself focused” type of advice, but it’s crucial. You have to keep in mind that the way you feel after training is likely to be drastically different than what you feel when you are at home and not training. This goes for when you are training too, so be sure to keep yourself in check and don’t get carried away with yourself. This is only going to make you worse in the long run.

Conclusion

There are a lot of things that can go right or wrong during training and fighting, and most of them are based on how you go about it. If you have a good plan in place, then you’re definitely going to have a better chance at success. If you have the proper mindset, then you will not only perform better, but you will also be able to keep yourself in the zone for longer.

Always be aware of what you need to do and make sure that you have a plan in place that is going to allow you to keep your mind in the game and get the most out of yourself.

I want to thank you for taking the time to read my article about 5 tips to help you succeed in training. I sincerely hope its contents have been a good help to you and I wish you good luck in all your endeavors.

I am writing to ask if you know of any organizations or companies who would sponsor MMA fighters. The fighter is a professional kickboxer and has been fighting for around seven years now.

I have attached a photo and a profile for him, I am confident that his skills and potential can help him become a champion. As you can see in his picture he is an African American male, and has very big dreams, being a good dad and building his legacy by helping to achieve change through MMA.

If you know of any companies or organizations that are sponsoring MMA fighters please forward me any information, and also please feel free to visit my website if you have any questions.

Yours sincerely,

Jana S.

If you’re on the side of the fighters, that is, then your instinct is to believe that fighters and the industry as a whole is in a crisis. You probably see MMA as a dying sport, a dying profession. You read articles that paint the industry as a place where fighters are being pushed too hard, where the life of a fighter is a lonely and brutal existence.

If you’re on the side of the sponsors and the owners, then you have a different perspective. I would argue that MMA fighters are thriving as never before.

What’s The Ideal Weight For An MMA Fighter?

When people talk about the optimal weight for an MMA fighter, they generally mean the top fighters. This is typically around 155 for men and 115 for women, which are often referred to as “catchweights”.

As more time goes on, people have been asking more questions about that optimal weight. Does it really exist? If it exists, is it the same for every fighter? Can you know a fighter is in it?

It’s one thing to be talking about the top fighters. It’s another to be talking about the average fighter.

The reality of the situation is that the average fighter can get in a position where they are no longer fighting at an optimal weight, and is generally unable to bring their weight back down to optimal levels.

You hear all these stories of fighters who come in overweight and have to stay in a tough weight cut in order to be able to make weight. In fact, you hear these stories more often than you hear about fighters who fight their entire career at the optimal weight. It’s easy to lose sight of what’s going on in the middle of all the noise.

So what’s really happening when we say that fighters are generally fighting at an optimal weight? There’s no perfect science to it, but some general principles can help paint the bigger picture:

Punching and running is much easier at the optimal weight. If you’re not at the optimal weight, then you aren’t going to be able to outrun or outpunch your opponent as often.

If you’re not at the optimal weight, then you aren’t going to be able to outrun or outpunch your opponent as often. Your ability to perform under duress is enhanced when you’re at the optimal weight. If you’re running and getting hit in the head for 30 minutes, then there are going to be more serious long-term consequences to your health if you’re not at the optimal weight.

If you’re running and getting hit in the head for 30 minutes, then there are going to be more serious long-term consequences to your health if you’re not at the optimal weight.
