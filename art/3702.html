Founded and directed in 2008, the E-File Institute (EFII), a certified software institute located in Los Angeles, CA, has helped over 25,000 taxpayers, including corporations and tax practitioners, successfully prepare and electronically file their state tax returns. Over 200 practitioners trained by EFII hold an active Enrolled Agent certification, and many actively participate in an IRS-sponsored mentorship program. Through these means, and our partnership with the best-known tax preparation companies in the country, EFII maintains high standards of proficiency and service in order to continually assist clients in preparing their taxes. With our e-file service, we have an expert staff to prepare your returns and get them back to you in only 1-2 weeks. We'll also help you complete your tax return as soon as you return the signed forms. The tax season can be quite stressful for individuals, so it’s important to partner with a company that takes care of your tax filing needs.

How EFI services works?

Our tax experts will provide you with the best option available for your financial situation and will give you the best advice on whether you need to file with traditional forms or electronically. Depending on your needs, you can choose the best option for your financial situation.

Electronic filing/e-file services provided by EFII?

EFII’s electronic filing service includes free electronic filing, e-mailing, mailing of tax returns, and tax preparation for small businesses with total assets less than $5 million. After the deadline has passed for the filing of your return with the IRS in paper form, you will be given access to your electronic return directly from the company’s server.

How it works?

EFII is in direct partnership with the companies that you use in other areas of your life. By doing this, we get the ability to process and deliver tax returns at lightning speed. We’ll deliver you, in real time, your tax return’s status at no extra charge. We can also return your money to you instantly on the spot, regardless of the outcome of your return.

What does an e-file do for you?

The main reason for filing electronically is that it eliminates the stress of doing so in person. A secure e-file gives you the comfort and assurance that your return will be filed immediately with minimal stress. It can also save you money on postage and save trees.

Don’t have an accountant?

At EFII, we make it easy to save a bundle of money by going paperless. For a fee, we help you to understand your filing status, and guide you through the return process. Since we’re connected to tax-preparation software companies we can make sure your electronic tax return is processed immediately, saving you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars!

At EFII we provide high-quality professional services for our clients. From preparing tax returns to assistance with tax season planning, our experienced staff of tax specialists is with you every step of the way.
