CHAPTER I

'THE MAIDEN WIDOW'S' FIRST APPEARANCE

_Wherein a certain female person, who has never been seen, is introduced
to the reader, in a style calculated to excite astonishment_


Mr. John Spavin lived at home, with his mother and his sister, and a
sister's husband, in the small village of Plumstead;--there being not
more than half a dozen streets, scattered about, and containing, with
the church and the mill, which was within half a mile of the centre of
the hamlet, as many families as made the place respectable in the eyes
of its population, and perhaps a little more in proportion to its
circumstances, than many of them are in more extensive places. Mrs.
Spavin was not altogether an old woman. She was not very young either,
nor very old, nor much in the middle; but she was certainly an old
woman, and she had been a widow for many years. The sister and the
husband, too, were something older than the rest of the family. The
three men were all tall, and lean, and ugly; and the sister, as has been
already said, was tall and lean, and ugly; but the other man was very
tall, and thin, and ugly. The sister was the sister of Mrs. Spavin,
which makes it probable that the niece must have been the daughter of
the niece, though we have not heard that there was any such near
relative. Mrs. Spavin was in all things--with reference, at least, to
her friends and her neighbours--perfectly upright, both in feeling and
in act, in a word she was a good woman.

With reference to her niece and nephew, she was very severe, believing
that a good woman ought to be severe. She was also very jealous of her
husband, and was of opinion that a good woman ought to be jealous. A
woman, if she could possibly be so made, should never marry the best
man in the world for the sake of a hundred guineas. But she did not like
to see her sister's husband, so she said, talking with the old man; and
as she looked upon her own husband as the most good-natured, most
obliging, most benevolent, and the most respectable of men, she was of
opinion that he, too, would be in the right to quarrel with her niece.
The truth was, that the cousin, by which name the man was always
called, was in love with the niece, and had been so from a very early
period in life, when he had been sent from the neighbourhood, to go to
the expense of sending him to school. This had been done early in the
lady's life, which made it natural, when so great a change should take
place in her appearance, for those who lived near her to think about
other things besides the great change which had been made in her
appearance. It is often so natural for those who watch the progress of
that most wonderful of all the works of God to think about other things
than the progress of the wonderful work of the great Physician. Men,
and women too, love to see nature in her operations, and to see
everybody's concern about nothing but their own concerns. Mrs. Spavin
always thought that her niece was very foolish, and it became natural
to her and to her sister to think that the cousin was very foolish. And
so he was.

We are not told whether Mrs. Spavin had any sons, nor whether the
husband had ever married before. Her sister had a daughter, who was
married, and the wife was called Mrs. Spavinet. She was a very good
woman, as became a mother of an only child; but she was no companion for
the mother, and, though she lived in the same village with her, and she
visited her every day, and had for her all those claims of affection
which friendship, though not blood, creates, still the old lady felt
that something was wanting in her life. Why should she not have had
sons? why should there not be some one to look after the estate,--for
she certainly had an estate; and if one could have looked upon the
sadness of the little grey cottage and have heard the old woman talking
to herself as she sat on her bed, one might perhaps have made some
guesses as to her dreams. And if one would have looked upon her
countenance when sitting by her own hearth, one would have seen that she
loved to look at the fire, and on the roof of her cottage. The truth
was, however, that Mrs. Spavin had never been blessed with more than
five sons.

The reader will understand from all this that John Spavin, the father,
was a good, respectable man;--that his wife was a good woman;--and that
their niece was of a more than common degree of beauty. The reader will
also understand that Mrs. Spavin, though not exactly of an ordinary
size, was a stout person for a woman, and that she sat very upright in
her chair, and that she was not only stout but long-bodied. They have
travelled in the course of this story from one country to another, and
perhaps from England into another country; but we have taken it for
granted that they lived at Plumstead, within half a mile of the
churches, and the town-hall, and the great mill.

The old lady was very angry with her niece, on the morning we are
speaking of, not being at the cottage when the day's dinner should be
ready. It was a fine day. Such days, with such skies, are fine, and no
man can say that he has had such a day if he has not had one of them.
Heaven and earth did not fight on such a day; the very winds and the
waters were still; and the grass, and the trees, and the green leaves,
grew stiller too. Such weather as that is not allowed for nothing, and
the people of that day called such a day a day of the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:56
