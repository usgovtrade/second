Ingredients:

4 eggs

2 cups heavy whipping cream

2 tbsp. flour

2 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted

1 tsp. salt

Freshly ground pepper to taste

4 large slices toast, toasted

4 thick slices Black Forest ham

Directions:

Hard boil the eggs. Drain and run under cold water until they are room temperature. Peel and slice the eggs lengthwise. Place the eggs in a bowl with the heavy whipping cream and milk and season to taste with salt, pepper and a few drops of white truffle oil. Whip with an electric beater until the mixture is fluffy. Set aside. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, flour and melted butter together. Stir in the chopped ham, cheese and parsley. Divide this mixture among the 4 toast slices. Fill each of the egg cups with this mixture. Top each egg cup with a slice of egg. Place in a heated oven (425°) for about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and garnish with a sprig of watercress and a sprinkle of fresh herbs. Serve with a wedge of fresh, red-rinded cheese.

Rabbit in a Tuxedo

Ingredients:

4 rabbit loins, boned and skinned

1 package dry taco seasoning mix

1 pkg (8 oz) cream cheese, softened

¼ cup chopped fresh chives or green onions

½ cup half and half

1½ cups finely shredded cabbage

2 cups mixed shredded carrots and red peppers

1 cup grape tomatoes

1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Toasted white sesame seeds

2 cups tortilla chips, crushed

Directions:

Combine the taco seasoning mix and half and half in a small bowl and spread on the loins. Wrap the loins in cheesecloth and tie the corners together to make a bag. In a large saucepan, cook the rabbit in salted water to cover for 20 to 30 minutes, until the loins are tender. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Cool loins, then thinly slice. Meanwhile, drain and mash the garlic cloves from the taco mix and stir in the cream cheese, chives or green onions, and half and half. Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat a shallow 1½-quart baking dish with cooking spray and fill with loins, vegetables, grapes and tomatoes. Pour the cream cheese mixture over the meatloins. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake at 350°F for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, uncover, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Place the tortilla chips in a shallow baking dish. Heat in the oven until crisp and place in the center of the table. As your guests eat, sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and serve with a bottle of Heidseck Apfelwein.

Lamb Toulouse

Ingredients:

1 cup bread crumbs

1½ cups boiling water

1 tbsp. olive oil

½ cup olive oil

3 lb. rack of lamb, cut in

½-inch slices

Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

1 cup unsalted chicken broth

1 cup chopped mushrooms

½ cup minced garlic cloves

1 cup toasted almonds

1 cup peeled, seeded and chopped green tomatoes

Directions:

Combine the bread crumbs and boiling water in a bowl. Slowly add olive oil, stirring to mix well. Season the lamb with salt and pepper, and then roll in the bread crumb mixture. Let stand for about an hour. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, combine the chicken broth, ½ cup of olive oil and the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat a large skillet over medium heat until very hot and brown the meat. Remove the lamb from the skillet and transfer to a large, shallow casserole. Pour the broth mixture over the lamb. In a separate large skillet, heat the remaining ½ cup olive oil over high heat until very hot. Fry the garlic until it is lightly brown and then add the green tomatoes and almonds, stirring over high heat until the oil is very hot and the garlic, tomatoes and almonds begin to sizzle. Stir them into the lamb mixture. Cover the skillet and turn off the heat. This dish can be prepared an hour before serving. Bake uncovered in a preheated 350°F oven for 10 minutes to heat through. Serve as an entrée with roasted potatoes or as a main course on a bed of steamed rice.

Rack of Lamb with Port Wine Sauce

Ingredients:

4 fat, thin lemon slices

4 cloves garlic, peeled

1 tsp. ground sage

½ tsp. salt

2 tsp. minced fresh thyme leaves

4½ tsp. cornstarch

1 cup white wine

½ cup port wine

1 tsp. salt

1 rack of lamb, 12 ribs, boned, trimmed of fat, and cut into 8 chops

Directions:

In a small bowl, mix together the garlic cloves, sage, salt, thyme leaves and cornstarch. Reserve. In a heavy, 2-quart saucepan, bring the white wine to a boil over high heat. Add the port and sugar, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes or until reduced to about ½ cup. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon slices, setting them in place with toothpicks if desired. Sprinkle the lamb with salt. Place the lamb chops in a large ovenproof skillet. Pour the sauce over the chops and cook over low heat, turning often, until browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a heated platter. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve.

Stuffed Pork Tenderloin

Ingredients:

1 lb. bacon

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

2 cups chicken stock

¼ cup dry white wine

1 large onion, chopped

1 carrot, chopped

1 rib celery, chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1½ tsp. salt

1½ tsp. pepper

½ cup milk

2 pork tenderloins

2 eggs, beaten

¾ cup fresh bread crumbs

¼ cup kalamata olives, pitted and quartered

½ cup toasted pine nuts

1 recipe Basil Pesto Sauce (see page )

Directions:

Cook the bacon and drain on paper towels; crumble and set aside. In a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the chopped vegetables, garlic and salt. Sauté for 5 minutes. Add the bread crumbs and seasonings and mix well. Add the white wine and stock. Simmer until tender, about 45 minutes. Drain the vegetables and transfer them to a food processor. Add the crumbled bacon and puree until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Prepare a large roasting pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Put the whole tenderloins in the pan, and stuff with the vegetables and pesto. Beat the eggs and milk together in a small bowl; brush onto the pork tenderloins. Roast uncovered for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F, move the roaster rack from under the meat to the center and bake for another 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through and a meat thermometer inserted into the center registers 160°F.
