These next two events aren’t actually in the area, but are worth checking out nonetheless.

The first is the Festival of Lights, which has been going on for the last 20 years or so in the North Side neighborhood of Humboldt Park, which is where most of the festival events take place. The tradition dates back to an annual religious holiday where the Catholic church would let off fireworks in remembrance of Jesus, with the intention of bringing good luck to families celebrating. In modern day, it has evolved into a bigger celebration with more than 500,000 people from all over the area showing up for the tradition of having a community potluck dinner followed by a fireworks show that ends with thousands of balloons released into the air. During a good year, the fireworks go on for over an hour and a half and can be seen from all over the city.

So there you have it! 10 reasons you’ll want to get into the spirit of Halloween by celebrating the area’s unique history. Even though the holiday has come and gone, the memories of the festivities live on in the culture of the city, so you’ll want to experience it if you’re in town.

We’re thrilled that you’ve decided to stop by and check us out. We hope you’ll stop by often — telling us what you loved (or hated) about the site. After all, “You say potato, I say potato.”

Milwaukee Neighborhood Summit and Youth Job Summit

August 17, 2019 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM @ Atrium at Discovery World

The Downtown United Way of Milwaukee is proud to support the Milwaukee Neighborhood Summit. This annual event is a day of action and education for residents and visitors about the neighborhood of their choice.

The Milwaukee Neighborhood Summit is a free annual event hosted by the Downtown United Way that allows community leaders, elected officials, local experts, and residents the opportunity to build community connections around the issues that matter most to them. It is our most important annual convening event. This is the only event of its kind that brings together diverse voices from the entire community.

Our goal is to create a community-wide conversation about the need for change in a neighborhood and where that change needs to happen. Our communities deserve to be informed and involved in the decisions that will shape the quality of life in their community. In 2018, more than 5,000 residents and stakeholders engaged in the Milwaukee Neighborhood Summit. The event continues to grow each year.

With the support of the Milwaukee Neighborhood Summit, we are proud to offer the YJB Summit, a day-long event focused on bringing together community leaders from all sectors to discuss the needs of young people and provide information to community members about effective workforce development strategies. A variety of organizations from business, government, and education will be on hand to share their efforts and provide practical and successful strategies for local employers. The Summit will consist of panels and other interactive and experiential learning opportunities focused on youth and young adult jobs and careers.

We hope that you will join us for the Youth Job Summit!
