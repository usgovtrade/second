As a good vegan, a vegan lover, I couldn’t resist making this fun piece of healthy vegan art. I put my love for art and all things green, creative and healthy in this fun “pets” for all the plant lovers, like myself, out there. I just love chia pets, and I just love how it brought the two cultures together and brings people of all persuasions together in good fun.

I love art. I am a true artist at heart, and being creative is a hobby that I cherish. The more time I put into this passion, the more I want to do it. So, it seems only fitting that when it came time to start a new hobby of raising Chia Seeds for pets and making chia pet fun, that I also would want to create art from my new hobby. My kids are always looking for a good story, and they love when I create new stories. So why not make some fun chia pets from an epic story that I could share with others?

What are Chia Seeds?

To get a good idea of what chia seeds look like you need to put them in a pair of scissors and slice it apart like I did above. They are tiny seeds, like about the same size as a grain of rice. You can buy them here. The picture above was taken with a regular DSLR camera.

What are Chia Pet How-Tos?

I had lots of fun with this piece. I really love how it turned out. I will explain the process of making these cute chia pets with pictures and details in my blog. If you want to know about how I made the different little fur patterns of the animals please read through my blog!

Check out the video below for the demonstration of my chia pet how-to for making cute chia pet fun!

The Chia Pet Video Demonstration:

The next day I went to the store to buy the materials needed to make these cute and fun chia pets. I bought 3 different colors of Chia Seeds to make different designs. When I went to the store, I looked up all the materials needed to make my chia pets, in case you are reading this blog and you need the materials to make chia pets, here is the list!

Materials Needed:

Chia Seeds (Brown, Blue and Pink) (2 different colors needed)

Cornstarch

Water

Chalkboard (Vegan Shaving Cream Tubes available here)

How to Make Chia Pets:

So, what you need to do to make these cute chia pet fun to make is very simple. You need a shaving board, with a chalkboard. You need a bit of water and about 2 to 3 tablespoons of chia seeds. Then, you need to mix it up! As you can see, from the photo, I used a funnel to mix up my chia seeds.

Then, you just need to dip your chalkboard in water and shake out the excess water. Next, dip your chalkboard into your handful of chia seeds (I did 2 handfuls) and then place it on your shaving board. Once you have the chia pet on there, your pet is ready to “sleep” for a few hours.

Chia Pet How to’s:

The next day you can come back and wake up your chia pets by scratching at them. This will make them wake up! Next, put them in water and you will notice the liquid will change color and they will start to look like a little animal!

The Chia Pet I Made:

I made two animals in each color and put them next to each other. You can also mix them up. My two animals next to each other are Blue Chia Pets, Pink Chia Pets and Brown Chia Pets. It’s as cute as it is fun and you can make these cute chia pets for all your friends. Enjoy and make some cute chia pets for all your friends!
