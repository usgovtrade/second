And why not? Even if it isn't the hottest selling new vehicle these days, Ford's best-selling car — even with declining sales — is still just as popular with customers as ever. There just isn't a great reason for Ford to ditch the Mustang. The sports car has always been a good-selling...

The Ford Fusion has been a huge seller for the Dearborn, Michigan automaker since its launch in 2005. With a sporty name and exciting styling, Ford’s car certainly gets a lot of attention. And while some people say it has lost its coolness since the new Focus coupe and Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid replaced it as Ford’s lone all-electric car, it remains on sale in all 50 states.
