"You won't do it," said
Mr. Wiggles, defiantly.
"I haven't got a gun. I 
don't think I've got a gun. 
I must've left it back at
the house. What? I'm sure 
I've got a gun. It must
have fallen out of my
pocket. Come on, give 
yourself up. 
This is no joke!"
"Your last 
chance," said Wilma, 
pleadingly.
"If you come out of this
alive, and get into a 
plane tomorrow, you've 
got a free honeymoon. An
expensive one. A one 
week honeymoon in Bermuda.
So take it while you've 
got it."
"Oh, all right, if it will 
stop your bleating. You 
can't trust a woman in
these matters, but I don't
mind telling you this: you 
were very attractive, 
even when you were in that
dreadful disguise. I'm
still a little peckish," he
said. He turned round. 
"And I've got a gun."
Chapter Twenty Four
Mr. Wilmot, Wilma and 
Norman were sitting in 
the living room of the 
hotel, where they had 
lunched. After a hurried 
luncheon, Wilma had told 
them of what had occurred 
that morning in San 
Francisco, and of the 
subsequent decision to 
return to Bermuda. She had
not mentioned Mr. Wiggles' 
proposal to commit suicide.
"All that nonsense of the 
phone call being from him.
I can't think why I believed
him. I have to admit that I 
didn't really believe him. 
But that's all past. What I
wonder now is if I would 
ever have taken him up on 
the offer if he hadn't
made that last comment 
about me being still 
attractive."
"You are attractive, Wilma,
" said Mr. Wilmot. "But I'm
afraid I must agree with Mr.
Wiggles. I think the idea of
suicide is a bit
morbid."
"I was a bit worried about
you, too," said Norman. "I
didn't like the idea of you 
being on your own."
"You aren't really my son," 
said Mr. Wilmot.
Norman's face turned red.
"How could anyone be so 
cruel?"
"Well, I must admit that I 
wouldn't have liked to be
on my own either. And I 
wouldn't have liked to be 
on my own with you, love.
Well, not you as an old
woman."
"Oh, don't get romantic,
Norman, at a time like this.
Well, Wilma. What next?"
"I think we'll take the
plane back tomorrow," she 
said. "I think we should 
leave tomorrow."
Mr. Wilmot looked grave. 
"I think it's a very good
idea," said Norman.
"There's one thing I'd like 
to do. I would like to visit
your Aunt Margaret."
"Oh, yes. If you like."
"No, don't put him off,
Wilma," said Mr. Wilmot. 
"Norman. If you want to
come with us, you can. It's
up to you, you know."
"It was nice to see you,
Wilma," said Norman. "But 
I've got things to do in New
York."
Mr. Wilmot looked at 
Norman, and then shook his
head. "I think not, son. 
I'm sorry."
"Can't we at least send you 
a note?"
"I don't think you'll want
to say anything to him. Not
in a note," said Wilma. "You
might as well face it,
Norman. It's not your fault."
"But I do want to say 
something to you," said
Norman. "I want to say 
that it was wonderful, 
Wilma. When you said yes to
me."
"Don't, Norman. We mustn't
start talking about it. We 
don't know what the future
holds."
"I don't care about the
future. At least I'll have
you. I love you, Wilma.
Always, I've loved you. And
I love you now, I still love
you."
"Oh, Norman, don't. You 
know that I love you too.
But this is much too fast. 
It's just a temporary 
romance."
"Is that what it is? My 
grandmother's story. I must
say I didn't expect this. 
Don't let's spoil everything
and talk about it. This is
only a dream. Just a dream."
"You'll stay in touch," 
said Mr. Wilmot.
"I don't want to stay in 
touch, I want to marry you,
Wilma. Now, before it's too
late."
Mr. Wilmot looked annoyed. 
He glanced at Wilma. "But 
Wilma's going to marry my
brother now," he said. "As
I said before, this is a
dream. Just a dream. That's
all it is, I'm afraid. I'm 
sorry. I must go back to
bed."
Wilma looked at her watch. 
"It's time we went to bed,
Norman. I'll stay up and 
fix up some sandwiches for
you. We can eat them in bed.
I'll make some coffee, too."
Norman nodded. 
"I'm very hungry, Wilma,"
he said. "I'll try to get 
some sleep. Will you tuck
me up?"
"Of course."
They walked along the 
beach together. At first 
Wilma walked in silence,
and then she said, "I have
been thinking about a lot
of things. And wondering.
Oh, how I want to get back 
to New York! This place is
so gloomy. And the waves 
are rather ugly. And that
gargoyle thing that 
wriggles up when you're
walking along."
"It's so gloomy here 
because of the gloom that
prevails in your 
conscience," said Norman.
"I shouldn't think there 
was much need to worry 
about it. As far as I can
tell, the whole issue has
been taken out of my hands,
and deposited in the hands 
of a higher authority. And
what's more, this higher
authority seemed to have 
decided that I should be
happy. I think I should 
feel blessed. Or at least,
relieved, relieved."
"Oh, Norman, please. 
Don't say those things. 
You know it's all been a
bit confusing. But you can't
expect to feel happy. But I
think you'll be happy,
Norman, if you'll only let
go and forget everything. 
Forget about Wilma, forget
about yourself, and forget 
about the world. Just go
to sleep and dream of 
gargoyles, and you'll forget
about everything, I
promise you."
"I wish I could believe you,
Wilma. I really do."
"You'll understand about 
Wilma in time. Not so far 
away. This is the dream of
our life now, Norman. If 
you will only sleep and be
at rest. But remember, 
Norman. Tomorrow will be 
different. In New York I
think you'll begin to be
happy."
"I think I will."
"Not just now, perhaps." 
Wilma said sadly. "We must
think of now, and how good
it has been. And how good 
it still might be."
"It's only a dream. But a
pretty nice dream," said 
Norman. "No. I want to see
the gargoyles up close. I 
want to find out what 
they're doing. And the
goblin. I must see what
the gargoyle is doing. It
makes me so hot."
Norman pulled off his
trousers and unbuttoned 
his shirt. He looked down at
his bulging waistband, and 
then raised his left arm. 
He let the suspenders go,
and it came off his back. 
He pushed his fingers into
the button, which came away
in his hand. Then he sat 
down on the sand, turned 
his head so he was facing</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:23
