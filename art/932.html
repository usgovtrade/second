“I didn’t have anything to lose, so why not?” 
“Because you need to learn when to stop, and not everything is worth the 
chance of being caught.” 
“I thought we weren’t doing anything illegal. 
Let’s go get me another iced tea.” 
“We need to go home. 
Let’s go.” 
The End.

Heather's POV 

I got home and sat down at the computer. 
I realized that I didn’t know about half the things that he and I were doing 
today. 
I was so nervous. 
I started digging around for answers. 
I knew that Chris had gotten a call from Mrs. Reynolds at the 
department, and my mom was not making it home from her doctor’s appointment. 
I was so afraid. 
I felt like I was about to pass out and had to lay down. 
I wondered if Chris was going to tell his mom and dad about what we did. 
Would he get in trouble? 
What was going to happen? 
I couldn’t breathe. 
It took several minutes before I could calm down. 
I did it. 
I got out of the site I was on. 
I knew it was probably a bad thing that I’d done. 
I started wondering what my mom would say if she found out. 
She’d probably think I was a bad influence. 
I just hoped this didn’t cause more problems between Chris and his parents. 
I felt sick at my stomach as I started to think of the possibilities. 
I felt myself start to spiral into thinking about it all again. 
It just wasn’t worth it. 
I felt so relieved that I’d taken the time out to read all of those web pages. 
My mom had been in her room all day. 
I started to wonder how much longer she’d be in there before coming up. 
I needed to get out. 
I grabbed a change of clothes from my closet and slipped out of the house. 
I sat down under the trees and looked at the creek. 
I just hoped that I could get this one over with and be home in time for dinner. 
I started to change. 
A few minutes later, Chris showed up. 
I took the clothes that I’d borrowed and started to walk down the creek. 
“Do you have any idea how far I walked for you?” 
He asked. 
“A mile.” 
“Oh, good. 
Is there a bathroom around here?” 
“There’s one up ahead. 
We can go in there if you want.” 
“Thanks.” 
I didn’t want to go. 
I really didn’t. 
I was just trying to stall. 
I was afraid that if I didn’t, Chris would come up with a different way for us 
to be together. 
He got up and walked up the trail toward the bathrooms. 
“Just be honest. 
I know that you took my class yesterday.” 
“Yes, I did.” 
“Did you like it?” 
“It was interesting.” 
“Too interesting?” 
“Yes. 
I liked it all right, but I wasn’t ready for it.” 
“You’re into those other guys, aren’t you?” 
“Yeah. 
I can’t stop thinking about them, but I was not into Chris when I first met 
him.” 
“If you were attracted to them, why did you even go out with me?” 
“Because I had to.” 
“It was just so that you could sleep with me.” 
“I knew that you were the one. 
I felt it the first time that you kissed me.” 
“I had to do that so I’d find some way to get you to sleep with me.” 
“You had it planned.” 
“It took me a while to get to that point. 
That’s how much you got me hooked on these guys. 
I just wanted to be like them. 
I wanted the girls to look at me the way they looked at them.” 
“I’m glad I was able to help you get your wish.” 
“I didn’t want to fall for you, so I was just using you to get into bed with me. 
If you’d ever gotten excited, then I would have gone ahead and done it. 
I would have started thinking about you as someone I liked.” 
“It was better to see you like them. 
Now I don’t have to worry about you.” 
“Thanks. 
I like how well you think. 
You’re the best in class. 
I’d let you keep thinking, but I’m afraid that I might like the feeling 
too much.” 
“This is really stupid.” 
“What?” 
“Being here, spending time with you.” 
“You want me to leave? 
I’ve got nowhere to be.” 
“I’ve got somewhere to be.” 
“How did you get here?” 
“My mom’s car. 
My dad is in Connecticut this week.” 
“Where are you going after you go through this?” 
“I can just catch a cab.” 
“I’m going to the store and then I’m meeting some guys for a movie later.” 
“Sounds good.” 
“You want me to help you change into your clothes?” 
“No. 
I can do it myself.” 
“Oh, okay. 
I’ll see you later.” 
I took my bike and headed back to the house. 
My mom and dad were still in their bedroom. 
I could tell that they were both still awake. 
Chris followed me in and closed the door. 
He started touching me. 
“You liked it.” 
“Yeah.” 
“A lot.” 
“I thought so.” 
“I would have told you before. 
I didn’t want you to think that I was using you.” 
“It’s okay. 
Are you still here tomorrow?” 
“Yeah. 
I have to be there at six.” 
“I have to go get changed.” 
“I’m sorry. 
Are you going to be all right? 
I hope they don’t make a big deal of it. 
You don’t have to worry about me.” 
“I’m fine. 
I didn’t know it was like that. 
I’ve never really gone through it before.” 
“I’m just relieved that you made it through it.” 
“Thanks.” 
“Are you sure you’re okay?” 
“Yeah. 
Are you okay? 
Did you enjoy it?” 
“Yeah. 
I liked it. 
You taste good.” 
“You’re amazing.” 
“I’m a guy.” 
“I’m going to see you tomorrow.” 
“I hope you like this.” 
“I can’t wait.” 
I had to get up at five. 
I grabbed my school uniform and headed to the bathroom to change. 
It was dark when I came out of my room. 
My mom was passed out on the bed. 
The lights were out and I didn’t want to go in. 
My dad was working on his laptop and got up to get me a glass of juice. 
“What are you doing?” 
“I’m staying up to finish this.” 
“How is it coming?” 
“It’s going great.” 
I could see him reading. 
He put his laptop down and got up to go get me a glass of iced tea. 
“You were supposed to be in bed an hour ago.” 
“I got a little late. 
Can I finish up now? 
I have a lot to do.” 
“Okay.” 
“I’m on it, dad. 
Thank you.” 
He walked back over to the bed and sat down. 
He reached under the covers and took my hand. 
“You have to make sure that you’re taken care of.” 
“I will, dad.” 
“We love you. 
We’re proud of you.” 
“Thanks, dad. 
I love you.” 
I could see him wipe his eyes. 
I went to the bathroom to take a shower. 
I used more soap than I needed, but it didn’t matter. 
I wanted to give Chris a bad aftertaste. 
I stood in front of the mirror and started to shave. 
I could hear my mom moving around in her bedroom, so I waited to go in. 
I dried off and brushed my teeth. </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:13
