"If he could read your thoughts, it wouldn't have been necessary to go to all the trouble of building you, would it?"
And finally, in a moment of true horror, Dr. Jones revealed that he was not interested in what was in the box but instead, he was looking for the box itself, not the contents.  "The key, of course," Jones said to himself, "To the final understanding of the box, we need to know what is inside, so..."
But Jones is cut off, as the box gives a loud, ear piercing screech, sending him back to the floor.  The box itself is knocked onto the ground with a thud, revealing the shocking truth - it is nothing more than a blank black box.
After some consideration, Jones says aloud, "There is nothing inside,"  And then, with great disappointment, he realizes, "Oh, I guess it is empty after all."
When the black box is open, it glows a brilliant red, showing that it has been activated for unknown reasons.
From the glow, a voice can be heard saying, "Welcome to the box," and then a giant door slides open in front of the black box.
It turns out that the giant door is a huge, hollow tube that is filled with an infinite amount of small, red orbs. 
Jones looks deep into the eye of the box and sees that, in fact, the box is all that is left of himself and that he is no longer able to function in the outside world.
A moment later, Jones walks into the black box and the door closes behind him with a loud noise.

Sounds like I, Claudius (the original BBC series, not the '96 miniseries reboot).

In the episode SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, I, Claudius, states that the Tardis makes a loud "poot" sound to travel around time-space in. The Tardis also takes the shape of a spherical black box.

In the episode THE SILENT DOCTOR (also the beginning of this year's series), the Silents bring a woman who has the black box, which turns out to be Claudius's time travelling device from the I, Claudius show. 

She explains to Dr. Tyler that the woman he found a few episodes ago, a lady who was once a great actress and used to go by the name of Joan Hartley, is herself in the past. However, she doesn't know if she's really Joan Hartley or not. All she knows is that the woman she is, at least the time traveler's version of her, arrived at some point in time, at the Blackpool Opera House (which is the set of I, Claudius), and the only way out is through the box.
She was once a great actress but got into drugs and became fat and lost her career. She also had a child, named Matthew, and because she became fat, they didn't want to see her. They would sometimes stop and watch her on stage but never applaud. Her name was Joan Hartley, but she changed it to Joan Holderley to get away from her life. When she discovered the past version of herself, she became confused and was told to "go back to before you met yourself," which at first she refused, then did not, and she was put into a caravan outside. Then she decided to go back to the beginning and began her new life at the beginning of her "self".
At some point she decided to use the Tardis and go back to her life. That's when she met the Doctor, who saw her and went after her. This is where it goes wrong, and she's put in the box. And that's when the Doctor arrived and made it all happen, giving her new life but also killing her. Only she didn't die because she came back to life when she was put in the box.

She does end up living the same life Joan Holderley did, but as a woman who could get away from it and then became a great actress.

The original line is from The Black Adder:

LADY: It takes me years to get used to wearing clothes.

And the Doctor looks at the box, exclaiming "What sort of box has four legs?", exactly as you have described. The "four legs" are for carrying, but in order to carry something, it has to be top-heavy.
This is because the real answer is Doctor Who: The Complete Fifth Series. In the original, the Doctor and Nyssa are travelling with a new companion and they pass through a place on the way. To the Doctor's horror, the locals see him (it) in the sky and call it a "box" and he exclaims, "WHAT KIND OF BOX HAS FOUR LEGS?". When the Doctor opens the box, it makes a poot-like sound and begins to take off into the sky. It turns out that the old man wanted to fly it, but he was too poor to get the fuel to run it (not to mention that he couldn't read). So the Doctor and Nyssa took it. On the way back, Nyssa says the line,

LADY: Oh no! I haven't got anything to wear.

This implies that, although the box is now useless, it still had other functions, and is still in service. 

Of course, the main theme of Doctor Who in that episode is the idea of the Doctor being an alien and human-alien hybrids. The character is a cross between "The Doctor" from the original series and "Dr. Who" from the "Dr. Who and the Daleks" episodes.

I agree with the other answer about I Claudius.
Another question that resembles this is "I Dream of Jeannie".  From Wikipedia:

Jeannie uses a device called a 'time belt' to travel through time, which also gives her the ability to make it look like she's in different places. She is also able to change clothing (from an evening gown to a swimsuit) at will.

From I, Robot

Weyland: This is...
  [turns to face the TARDIS]
  TARDIS: Do you understand? Do you understand me?

  Weyland: Yes! The TARDIS is a word, if you need help.
  [the TARDIS makes a noise]
  TARDIS: poot
  [the TARDIS turns into a door]
  Weyland: The TARDIS is a machine.
  [a door opens and light from the TARDIS is blocked by the door]
  TARDIS: poot
  [reaches out a claw]
  TARDIS: poot
 
 Weyland: The TARDIS is going to go.
 
 TARDIS: poot

This is the first instance I can find in which the machine refers to itself as a box.
