“Gotta let go, gotta let go, gotta let go”

If you have ever been let down by your significant other, you’ll see the importance of the track. It captures the moment when you realise that the person you love more than anything in the world has the potential to be so cruel. It’s a song that lets you know that no matter how strong you are, someone else can still get under your skin, something else can make you angry, someone else can break your heart and it’s ok. Everything will be ok. The line “letting go is letting go” is a perfect quote because you cannot keep holding on to the past. Once you can let go of the anger and move on, you can start living.

10. The Beatles – She’s Leaving Home (Acoustic)

A lot of people love The Beatles, and that’s because they were a band with the strength of 10 men. They changed music in every way and brought a lot of people together. Not only was this song used in the iconic film A Hard Days Night, but they also wrote the soundtrack to Help! This song is very powerful and was always the song we chose for my birthday on the big screen. I think the line “you never gave me your love, but I still love you” is particularly relatable because we all love to know that we are loved, however the person never gave us their undivided attention. It’s the small things like that which are what love is made of and really do mean the world to us.

9. The Pretenders – (Get A) Grip (Acoustic)

This song was performed by Boy George and the Pretenders at the 1997 Brit Awards. This is one of the coolest moments on stage of any awards show because not only are they playing an original song, they then transition into Queen’s “Radio Ga Ga”. I remember being really overwhelmed when watching this and how the band seemed so cool and how all the members were enjoying each other’s company. It was a great experience and I’m really glad I got the chance to experience it.

8. Rihanna – Don’t Stop the Music (Version 1)

What can I say? This is one of the best albums of all time in my opinion, and this track featured in the video. It was one of the main reasons why I bought the album and I used to listen to it when it was getting dark and listening to it when it was getting light. This was probably one of the first singles I listened to after the record release and I will always associate this song with the album. The line “don’t stop the music, I’ll be out soon” resonates with me so much, as this is the line which tells us that we will survive. Even if we do end up in a life of nothing but pain, when we survive that’s exactly what you do, you keep going. I love the message and I’m so glad I got to listen to this song.

7. Nirvana – Heart-Shaped Box

In a year which seemed to be filled with so much sad news, Nirvana put together their last album ‘Nevermind’ and put together this classic track for us all to remember them by. It was their last tour and that was one of the main reasons why I was so shocked and saddened when he died in the end of the last decade. I didn’t get to go to the last few shows but if I did, I know I would have cried my eyes out, especially at this song. The band really made me feel happy when I was young and this song is one of my favourites to listen to every day.

6. The Beach Boys – Pet Sounds (Deluxe Edition)

Now this may sound a bit off, because they are not my favourite group, however I was very lucky to have the opportunity to see The Beach Boys live in 2012, and seeing them perform this song always puts me in a great mood. I used to get emotional while listening to this track because of the lyrics which seem to portray what love is. It’s really sad, but it’s relatable for everyone which is why this song was so relatable and it was the one I connected to the most out of the entire musical concert. This song really was amazing and I was so happy to have seen the band play it.

5. Lissie – Run-Around

I never really listened to this song before listening to the lyrics. It’s always been an album which I’ve always listened to when I felt stressed out, as it really is a brilliant album and one of my favourites of all time. The first few times I listened to this track were with my family, I always thought it was a bit strange that she says “I’m just a girl”. I really have no idea what it means, but when listening to the album it’s one of the tracks that stands out the most. It’s beautiful and I was surprised to hear this track one day at my mum’s house. To know that this band put it out and that people know about it is amazing, especially when most artists in their position of popularity would not do so.

4. Eminem – Not Afraid

This was a track I really looked forward to listening to on his next album The Marshall Mathers LP. This album was released before I was even born, and it’s still one of my favourite albums of all time. Em is the rapper I listen to the most and the reason why is because he was actually born in the town I grew up in and he has helped me through some difficult times and helped me when I needed someone. There’s something about his personality and passion for the instrument that makes you feel like you know him. Not to mention his skills are second to none when it comes to rap and his lyrics are so relatable which makes it so easy for any listener to relate. “I don’t give a fuck what they say/because I know that they just mad at me/cause they ain’t me”

3. The Beatles – Eleanor Rigby

This is one of my favourite songs of all time and by far, one of my favourite Beatles songs. I still remember when I had to perform this song in the music class in year 6 and how nervous I was. After I performed it, it made me feel confident and I love the way the song tells you it’s ok. I used to listen to this song a lot when I was little, because it seemed like a sad song, and it would make me cry every time I would hear it. I really appreciate this song because it means so much to so many people all over the world. I always relate to this song when I’m really sad and when I need to know that things are going to be ok, “so it’s true what they say/about the best things in life/being free/are only free when they’re gone”

2. Lady Gaga – Born This Way

What can I say, this song is so fantastic and is the one which changed my life. It was one of my favourite tracks when I was 15 and every time I would listen to this song I would want to write and record my own music. I had the chance to meet Lady Gaga when she came to London and I made sure that I sat as close as possible to her. She looked fantastic and it was a great moment for a 16 year old to meet her in person. She’s so inspiring and I love her music so much and how it has helped me through the difficult times in my life. Lady Gaga is my muse and I couldn’t believe how amazing this song was. This song brings back memories of a time when I felt so lost and alone but at the same time, it tells you that you will always be loved and you are enough. I really appreciate the lyrics of this song because not only do they mean something to me, but they mean so much to many people all over the world. I’m thankful that this song is one of my favourites because it has</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:49
