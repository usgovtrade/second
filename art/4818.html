We are on every Tuesday at 3PM EST (That’s 2pm Central for you folks in other places in the world), and it is free! Come join us for a ride on the DC train! There will be guest hosts, fun discussions, giveaways, all that good stuff!

Here are a few things about The Green Arrow Podcast:

1) We will have some giveaways from time to time, especially towards the end of the year.

2) We will have a trivia segment, which will be announced as the day approaches.

3) We hope to have guests on from time to time, which will have no impact on the running time. It is our hope to keep the guest’s segments to under 2 minutes.

We encourage you to listen, and join us for our many topics of conversation! We talk about all things related to the Green Arrow, from the comics to the cartoons, to the upcoming CW series on the CW network.
