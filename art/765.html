“I know how much those boys meant to you.”

At approximately 4:40 PM on October 16, 2002, I sent the email below to Dr. Jones.   The email was entitled “Thank you.”   I wanted to recognize all of the tremendous support that he and UTFTL has provided me and my family during this terrible time.


It has meant a great deal to me and my family to have the support and prayers of those at UTFTL.   I know that things will get better, and although we will not see each other for a while, please let me thank you for all that you have done for all of us.

	Hello again from AL and Leonard.  Leonard is still on the phone with you.
	Haven't talked to you in a long time.  The boys had a rough night and just
	fell apart last night.  I really haven't slept since Monday.  Just hoping
	you guys are doing ok.  Leonard has some health issues and not doing well.
	Won't make it too long.  We are thankful to God for everything he is
	keeping you and your family going through right now.  He really is a
	wonderful God.  Tell Leonard my prayers are with you all. We
	wish we could be there but Leonard feels too weak to travel.  I have taken
	some medicine this week for the pain. I sure do miss that old feeling. 
Told
	you we didn't feel it. Guess we were selfish.  Tell everyone hello and God
	bless you guys and the little one.

	Dad, how you doing? 

	I know it hasn't been too long since you wrote, but I still take the time
	to write to you at least twice a week. This morning when I was going
	through my mailbox I happened to come across the letter you sent me at
	Christmas. 
		 I just want to thank you again for all the encouragment and support
	you gave us both, especially me. I am sure you know what I'm talking about.
	I made it until the end of February.  I have just been going through a
	rough time.  Well, if I can think of anything I will let you know.  God is
	really good.  I know that no matter what, he always has a plan for me and
	that I have nothing to fear but death and hell.  I really hope that things
	get better for you guys.  I really pray every day.  If you ever need to
	talk, you know my phone number.  I don't plan on living here in Pasadena
	very long.  I plan on moving either to Riverside, CA. or San Bernardino. 
It
	really would be more convenient if I lived in Riverside or San
	Bernardino.  I love you guys very much, Dad.  I have to get going. I have
	to drive to the VA to check in for my appointment to get my back brace
	re-evaluated.  I'll see you guys soon. 	All the Best! 

	AL
