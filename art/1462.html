Today my team and I are starting a blog devoted to reviews of albums, music and anything else that comes to our mind. I plan to get my mom and my daughter involved in the blog and also take the opportunity to share some of our favorite songs and albums we've discovered this past month. Hopefully you guys will get something out of it. So here we go!

So I first encountered Lana Del Rey with her album 'Born To Die', but to be honest, I never heard a song of hers at that time. And it's been about 2 years since her debut, so what better way to introduce her and what she does best than with her sophomore release, 'Paradise'.

Just like her debut, Del Rey is a woman who doesn't need a man to do all the talking for her. She's capable of singing sweet, melodic love songs or heart wrenching and emotional songs that make your heart ache. But I won't say she has a voice for melodies or anything else, because I have yet to hear her sing any melody that is memorable, but the way she delivers the lyrics is what makes her songs. Even if I don't understand the lyrics, the way she whispers them is enough to evoke the mood she is trying to express. So is this album a love or a hate it. I can't help but associate it with a love, because I know if I had been listening to her when I first heard her, I would've ended up buying the entire album. But if it were in my hands when I got it today, there's a chance I would not buy it.

The album starts with a song she has co-written with The Weekend, 'Your Beauty's Sick'. This song starts like it was meant to be a radio hit. Then she gets into another song that has that typical Del Rey sound of her, but like she says in the interview I read recently, her next album is a return to her acoustic, stripped down style that doesn't sound so much like a 'song I wrote to be on the radio'. The album ends with a song that is very simple in it's message but is absolutely beautiful. It's very obvious to me that there are a lot of things in Lana's life that have impacted her and it's why you could hear every emotion, whether it be happiness, sorrow or anguish, when she sings.

And with all these great tracks, it is still an album filled with pop songs, because this is a woman who is always a popstar! This is one of the albums I never skip, just like I always want to listen to the lyrics because I have yet to find a song I can relate to her personal life. But that is the same for any album that has a message in it. But you can tell that she is just as invested in making the pop songs work just as well as the sad songs. Even if this is her first album in the music industry, she already has the skill that will make her the best popstar of today's generation!

I started listening to her on Pandora and I think that was the best way for me to get used to her voice and how she delivers her songs. But now, I can't go without listening to her new album.

It's so weird, I listen to 'Music To Make Love To' on repeat all day. It's so much better than 'Born To Die' and I'm always looking for more of her stuff. I wish she would go back to the slow and stripped down music.

I absolutely LOVE this woman and I am SO glad you've come to love her as well. Although I am very unfamiliar with her songs, I am happy to see I am not the only one obsessed with her. I love her vocal capabilities and most importantly, what she is about as a person. I think music has a huge impact on who we become in life, especially the songs we listen to when we are teenagers or younger. There are many of us who still love and are obsessed with our favorite artists when they are our age!

I have a deep passion for writing and photography, but I also love to read books, especially young adult and biographies, I really like learning about people from different backgrounds. I consider myself a writer, even though it is only my first year at college and I haven't written anything yet. But someday when I do, I promise you I will let you know.

About Me

I'm 19 years old and living in the United States of America. I'm a college student with a huge passion for music and writing and I think a small knowledge of art. Music and writing inspires me, which is why I believe it is the best way for me to express my emotions, because it helps me find who I am and who I want to become.
All my images are taken by me or my mother, who also happens to be my very talented photographer.
I love to read, but I read very slowly. That is why my rating system reflects this, even though I may not have given it a lot of thought.
I love to sing, it's just part of me. It's like a second language and sometimes I feel like singing is my only way of communicating with others because English is my second language as well. But I never ever stop to listen to a song I like because I just get so lost in the music. It may sound weird but I just can't be still!
And as you already know, I love writing.
Enjoy my rambling!
