St. Malo from the sea. After death he appeared at St. Malo as a man who had lost his left eye. He then appeared to St. Gildas and told him that a bishop should be sent to him, to establish the holy see in his stead, and to bury the body of St. Julian. St. Gildas thereupon built his monastery, and afterwards St. Malo and his city were all sanctified by him. The body of St. Julian is also said to have been interred there.

St. Peter was bishop at St. Malo until the invasion of the Pagans. Then came St. Anacharius (d. 451), who had been a priest in Rome. He had obtained an introduction to the emperor Theodosius and returned to Brittany. By the prayers of the faithful the pagans were dissuaded from setting fire to the city and sacking the monastery. By order of the emperor, St. Anacharius and all the monks were driven from the island, to St. Honoratus in the north. St. Honoratus was the son of St. Potentianus, who with many companions, and the entire population of the island, had been slain by the Picts, after a long and bloody resistance, in the cemetery of St. Paul, on the island of St. Paul (or Ramsey), in 57. St. Honoratus now retired to St. Malo, which he made his principal abode, not returning to his seat at Tréguier until 519. He had as abbot and successor St. Agrinus, a son of St. Severin, and by his preaching converted the islanders. St. Agrinus was followed by St. Columban.

Feast of the dedication of the church, September 24.

Ancient Martyrology

St. Julian, second son of St. Paul, built a church for the apostles in the place of St. Peter. He is also said to have founded the see of St. Malo, and to have written the Acts of the Apostles in the Celtic tongue.

The same as St. Paul; hence in French, Pou-Paul, pronounced Po-olay; it is called Poolee in some old church books, and Puale in another.

Feast of the saint, August 25.

Our Lady of St. Julian

July 29 is the day the Church celebrates the feast of Our Lady of St. Julian, whose name was the result of the legend which explains the origin of the church of the island of St. Malo, erected by her, as the legend is detailed in the Life of St. Julian: St. Julian, the second son of St. Paul, who, with his brother St. Mark, led an austere life in the desert, having met on the confines of Brittany and Nantes a beautiful maiden, whom he was allowed to marry, and whose unselfishness made him, for some time, change his mode of living. But his austere habits at last became too much for his wife, and she fled, taking a little of the earth which he had dug in order to plough it. She had only taken earth for ploughing and a little money to feed her with; these she left, and fled across the sea to Brittany. She landed near the abbey of St. Malo, where her flight was discovered, and a fisherman was dispatched to pursue her, but he overtook her on the sea, and she promised to return. St. Julian went in search of her, and found her with the treasure she had preserved untouched, giving part to St. Julian and part to the fishermen. On this St. Julian promised that when a church was built for his brothers, St. Mark and St. Paul, he would build one also for the Blessed Virgin. From that time an altar was raised to her, and one to the three saints, in the place where St. Julian was buried.

St. Julian was martyred at Conques in Provence by order of a tyrant named Julianus. St. Honoratus and St. Maximianus were said to have preached the Gospel at Conques after him, and the faithful carried his body, which had remained incorrupt, and was said to have performed miracles, to a monastery, which was built on the spot where he was buried. The holy body was afterwards translated to the island of St. Malo, where it was interred, and miraculous cures were performed. St. Julian was placed under a dome of stone which covered his tomb, but he was in time replaced under a silver one in 1226, at the express command of St. Louis, who wished to honour the saint by having the church dedicated to him in the island of St. Malo. This island lies opposite the bay of St. Brieuc. On the right bank of this bay, in the midst of a wood, are the ruins of a chapel which formerly served the little church. It was the abode of St. Paul and St. Julian, and the monastery and martyrium of St. Victor, who suffered martyrdom by Julianus, king of the Gauls. In his memory the faithful erected a basilica at the spot.

On the day of his martyrdom, the Romans cut off his head, to carry the bleeding body to Paris. One of the companions of St. Peter, named Clement, cut off his head with a silver saw. The head was found after St. Victor had appeared in a vision to be that of St. Julian, and was placed in the hands of St. Victor, who had it enshrined in a reliquary under the altar of the church built in his name. He also had a church erected in this place, and placed beneath it a portion of the relics of St. Julian.

This site is devoted to propagating the Catholic Faith amidst intellectual freedom and religious tolerance. That is why I was born a Catholic:

For me the "word of God" is not just a book of beliefs, but rather the very words of my Jesus and my Mary coming to me through the Catholic Church, my mom's prayers and the saints who intercede for me and my family. So not "my word of God" as in the Protestant sense, but rather "my Catholic Word of God."

In 1854, Charles Barry designed a magnificent, Gothic Revival cathedral for the Catholic faithful in Great Britain. When it was consecrated, the cathedral seated 1,090 men.

From the Cathedral of Notre Dame to Notre Dame de Paris: The Story of the Transformation of the Cathedrals of Paris and Reims

To the casual observer, the cathedrals of Reims and Paris are essentially identical, but in fact, they have very different histories. After a long rivalry, they are united today as the cathedrals of Notre Dame de Paris and Notre Dame de Reims, and their union was initiated by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.

Here we will take a tour through history of the cathedral in Reims. The cathedral was not the first cathedral on the site, since that was a great Saint Peter’s Cathedral, built in the time</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:36
