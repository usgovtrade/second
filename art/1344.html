The camp in itself is a marvelous activity, combining a wonderful combination of games, art, sports, dance and music. The dance instructors and music teachers make sure that every campers' performance is well planned. The campers' energy level is also kept at the perfect level through an early dinner time.

Every morning the campers will be introduced to the camp by the camp guide. While the campers are busy enjoying the morning activities, the head of the camp would join in the camper's games and other activities. The morning games are usually exciting enough to entice everyone. Even though the camp is meant to teach children, campers of all ages are welcomed. This is where you get to see adults who are already well-travelled kids playing like kids themselves.

Camp instructors and counsellors are often campers themselves. They always know what the camper should and shouldn't do in order to maximize his or her potential and fun at the camp. The best part of a camp is the end of the camp. Camp counselors do their best to ensure that every camper has a memorable time in every camp.
