Introduction
============

In recent experiments on ion implantation of amorphous semiconductors, ion bombardment was found to induce non-thermal activated conductivity in $p$-doped Si films [@Gunnarsson_2004; @Schroer_2007]. Conductivity was found to decrease with increasing ion fluence as a power-law with exponent -0.66 (Ref. [@Gunnarsson_2004]) and -0.73 (Ref. [@Schroer_2007]). Moreover, when low-temperature electrical measurements are done, the device exhibits threshold voltage shifts associated with the conductivity variation due to ion implantation. A threshold voltage shift with ion concentration following a power-law with exponent $0.9<x<1.2$ is observed [@Gunnarsson_2004]. These observations could be explained by changes in the implantation depth of the ions in the amorphous material as a function of the fluence, where the increase in implantation depth due to ion bombardment is associated with an increase in the local ion concentration and vice-versa. This would be in agreement with measurements of ion implantation depth in amorphous silicon. The authors of Ref. [@Schroer_2007] investigated the changes in implantation depth due to electrical field-assisted amorphization by means of electron bombardment and found that it increased with fluence.

This scenario of spatial inhomogeneity induced by ion implantation was confirmed by a more recent study where it was shown that implantation of Li$^{+}$ also induces spatial fluctuations of electrical properties, such as threshold voltage and conductance, that follows a power-law of exponent $0.55<x<1.2$ [@Schroer_2008]. The presence of fluctuations indicates that the inhomogeneities that constitute the conducting phase induced by implantation are a result of ion diffusion into the surrounding material.

The above examples show that the local variations in ion concentration can induce, under suitable conditions, super-diffusion with exponent $0.55<\nu<1$ in ion-implanted amorphous semiconductor materials. This is characterized by a power-law relation between the length of a path and the number of implanted ions $L(x)\sim x^{1/\nu}$, where $x$ is the distance from the point of ion implantation and $L$ is the distance traveled by ions as they diffuse through the sample, $\nu=0$ corresponding to normal diffusion, $0<\nu<1$ to sub-diffusion and $\nu=1$ to super-diffusion [@Schroer_2007]. Such a relation between length and diffusion implies that the resistance of a percolating cluster of the conducting phase is a non-monotonic function of the implantation fluence. In a super-diffusive system, conduction through the percolation cluster dominates over inter-cluster conduction at higher concentrations, since the resistance of the clusters decreases with increasing ion concentration. This is possible if the diffusion coefficient is a non-monotonic function of the implantation concentration, since the cluster is smaller and has a higher average resistance in this regime. It was shown by Gunnarsson [*et al.*]{} [@Gunnarsson_2004; @Gunnarsson_2009] that electrical measurements can detect changes in the implanted ion concentration that result from ion bombardment of amorphous silicon, while the concentration can be measured by means of optical spectroscopy with an accuracy of 1%, implying that changes in ion concentration caused by ion bombardment can be measured by means of electrical or optical methods. On the other hand, changes in the conductance at higher ion concentrations can only be caused by ion diffusion and thus cannot be detected by optical spectroscopy.

The experiments described above [@Gunnarsson_2004; @Schroer_2007; @Schroer_2008] focused on $p$-doped amorphous silicon. As ion implantation introduces a substantial vacancy concentration, one could expect similar behavior in $n$-doped materials. Recently, the effect of ion implantation on the electrical properties of $n$-doped SrTiO$_{3}$ was investigated [@Kamiya_2010]. Ion implantation in SrTiO$_{3}$ was found to produce an increase in conductivity at low temperatures that is super-diffusive, with an exponent $\nu=0.58\pm0.05$. Thus, ion implantation of $p$-doped and $n$-doped materials were shown to induce a crossover from sub-diffusive to super-diffusive conduction.

Motivated by these experiments, we present in this paper a model of the diffusion of ions in amorphous materials, in which the transport is governed by a random walk on a one-dimensional lattice. The random walkers that describe the diffusion of the ions experience on-site and nearest-neighbor stochastic events that lead to changes in the ion concentration in the lattice. The model consists of a random walk where, at each site, there are four possible events, $\alpha =(1\rightarrow 0; 0\rightarrow 1;
1\rightarrow -1; -1\rightarrow -1)$, where a single nearest neighbor atom is added or removed from the lattice. The diffusion process is accompanied by vacancy production and annihilation, with probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively, which lead to super-diffusive transport with $\nu=0.7$ for $p\sim q$.

The random walk is controlled by two parameters, namely, $A=1/\nu-2$ and $B$, which are related to the average size of the ion-implanted region and to the probability of creation or annihilation of an interstitial atom in the lattice, respectively. The $A$ and $B$ parameters set the number of implanted ions in the sample. For instance, for ion implantation experiments, $B$ can be fixed to an appropriate value, and one should vary the fluence in order to vary $A$.

We study the evolution of the system as a function of time starting from an initially homogeneously filled lattice. The random walk is characterized by an average drift of ions in the lattice due to a bias arising from a driving electric field that is applied, and thus $A$ will vary with time. We perform numerical simulations and find that the system converges to a steady state, with an average drift of ions in the lattice, with average value $x_{ss}=A/B$ (see below). The model can be applied to ion implantation experiments by associating $\nu$ with an effective region width $D^{eff}=x_{ss}A/B$. In this model, the average defect concentration is not independent of the sample size since it depends on the ion concentration. We then use this model to explain ion-bombardment-induced memory effects in $n$-doped amorphous silicon.

We show that the model predicts an average shift in threshold voltage with ion concentration for He$^{+}$ ions, which agrees with experimental observations [@Gunnarsson_2004]. The fluctuations in threshold voltage can be interpreted as an effect of the variations in defect concentration, with the same scaling as the conductance fluctuations in the same system, namely, $x_{q}=B/A$ [@Gunnarsson_2004]. We also simulate the evolution of ion-implanted samples with ion concentration variations in the form of a positive power-law with exponent $1.0<\nu<1.6$ as a function of fluence and time. We find that super-diffusion can be observed over the whole range of ion concentration, and that the threshold voltage depends on the power-law exponent $\nu$, while the conductivity follows a power-law with an exponent $\nu$. Thus, the model reproduces the behavior observed in experiments on ion implantation.

===================================================================

In order to model ion-implanted materials, we define a one-dimensional lattice in which each lattice site can be occupied by either an electron (with charge $-e$) or a vacancy (with charge $0$) with the exclusion of an ion. The ions in the sample have charge $q$ and the vacancies have charge $2-q$. We consider a periodic lattice of $L$ sites with periodic boundary conditions, with lattice spacing $a$.
