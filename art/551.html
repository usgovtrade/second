I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things.'

I just turned to him with a scowl and said, 'Are you a little bit psychic? I 
just thought of it when we were talking. You can't help wondering what the 
people would think.'

Then I just shook my head and told him that it was not going to happen 
because 'we don't need the complications.'

We talked about the whole afternoon until the restaurant closed.

I had had a great time just hearing about the man's life. Then I told him 
about my new job, how happy I am, how well Jim and I got along... everything. 
It was the first time I had ever told him my personal business. He was 
impressed.

On the way home he told me that I am the most important person in his life 
now. He had never said that to anyone before and he said he always prays that 
I am safe at work and happy. I think I really like this man!

Just to prove to him that we are very normal, we went to a movie at the 
'Crown' later that night.

We both ordered coffee and he told the waitress to bring him his cup black. I 
asked him why he did that, and he told me that when he had been in the 
Marines, they gave him a black coffee because of his complexion. He asked 
them to make sure they did not spill anything on him so they had to make sure 
the cup was black. After all these years, he still has a complex about it.

It was very nice to see him so happy and relaxed.


God Bless You,
