And it is more obvious that it is difficult to tell where the fraud is in the route package because each route package also has some fraud detection and prevention information.
The main reason that caused the above problem is that the fraud detection and prevention information in the route package does not reflect in the route package itself. The fraud detection and prevention information is processed at the beginning of the route package, and it is saved as an alert to the route package itself. And when the route package is sent, the fraud detection and prevention information is not saved into the route package, which cannot ensure that the route package has its real status. When the fraud is found in the route package, a person must find out it in the route package itself. If there is no method to find out if there is a fraud in the route package itself, the real status of the route package is lost, and the fraud detection and prevention information cannot find out any new fraud. Because there are many types of different fraud detection and prevention information in the route package, and all of them must be input to the route package. However, the input is too complex to deal with. This not only affects the efficiency of routing the route package, but also makes the route package look like a very complex and unreadable network. If the input is too simple, the effectiveness of the route package will not be ensured.
At the same time, when the route package is used to perform the data processing, each route package includes three processes of the real-time location to the route package, the real-time location to the route information and the real-time location to the route package. The real-time location to the route package includes the checking the presence of the route package, receiving of the route package, sending of the route package and other processes. The real-time location to the route information includes the checking the presence of the route package, receiving of the route package, sending of the route package and other processes. The real-time location to the route package includes the checking the presence of the route package, receiving of the route package, sending of the route package and other processes. When an operator checks the presence of a received route package to find out if there is a problem, he can check whether he is a trusted sender (or, trusted receiver) in route package routes, and in some route package routes, it will be determined whether the operator has received route package fraud through the use of a trusted sender (or trusted receiver).
Therefore, it is an urgent issue to develop a method for processing route packages to solve the technical problem that the route package routes lose the real status information of the route package, and it is difficult to determine whether a route package fraud or not.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:34
