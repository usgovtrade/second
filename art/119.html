capable of this kind of deception.  I'm sure none of us would like to be 
taken advantage of.  Your relationship with Greg is more than 
inappropriate.  It's not safe for you to be on the road with him.  I know 
that you may feel as if Greg was the first serious relationship you've 
had, but you should be careful of him.  What if something bad were to 
happen to you?  I would hate to see you in the hospital.

I know that you may feel as if you can't do much about the 
situation.  I'm asking you to seriously consider not seeing him anymore.  
If you feel that you have to see him in order to maintain your sanity, 
please see a therapist to help you cope with your situation.  I'm sure 
your family is very concerned about you and would like to know you are 
doing well.  I'm sure they worry about you being in a situation where 
you feel the need to see a complete stranger in order to prevent 
yourself from hurting.

I hope you feel better soon.
