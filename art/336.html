Now. Or I 
will destroy your kingdom." 

I had been unable to keep the sword she carried from 
her even though I had my hands around her neck. I 
seemed to have little more control over things than I
had over Jahan when I was under his control. Why 
wouldn't I be? I wondered. I was under his control 
after all. And just because I had been able to break 
that control once, it didn't mean that I was now 
immune. 

"You know better than that," Jahan said. "I might 
threaten that easily enough to get what I want, but 
since it is no threat to me, I won't. That is not the 
way I work. You are mine, and my will will be done." 

I looked into her eyes. Her beautiful dark eyes. So 
different from mine. I would have loved to say that I 
understood them. But I couldn't. My eyes were 
staring back at me in the mirror. I was staring into my
own. 

It occurred to me that I could control her again. I 
doubted I had the strength to do it now, and I 
certainly didn't have the time, but it was still 
something to be able to think about. I needed more 
information. 

"I want to know what I am and what I am doing here. 
Will you help me?" I asked. 

She gave me a look. 

"Why is that different?" I asked. 

"This is not the place for this discussion," she said. 
"You already have everything you need, but this is not 
the time." 

I looked at her. "Why not? You can stop me." 

"You'll make me do it, and I don't want to," she said. 
"I'll do it if I must. I hope I don't have to. But you 
will have to learn that I do as I wish to and that you
must do what I say. You must learn that you must 
follow my commands or face punishment." 

I was in despair. 

"What will my punishment be? What happens when I 
want to go and you won't let me?" I asked. 

She shrugged. 

"That is your punishment. You must go when I say 
so. You will learn this, because I will make you." 

"What if I don't want to learn this?" I asked. 

"You must or you will suffer," she said. 

I looked at her and said, "I am not a dog." 

She looked at me as if I were. 

"I don't want to be your dog," I said. 

She looked shocked. 

"But that is what I am. I have no choice," I said. 

"If you do as I say, you won't," she said. 

"What are you going to do to me?" I asked. 

"You won't remember this," she said. 

I remembered nothing of this, but I felt pain in my 
vagina as if I had been penetrated. It was more like 
that than it was like sex. I wanted to scream. 

"I'm sorry," she said. "I should have told you I 
didn't mean for you to get pregnant." 

I looked at her, uncomprehending. 

"I'm sorry, it will be alright. But you are 
pregnant." She looked down. 

"You're pregnant?" I asked. 

"I'm sorry, but you are. I didn't want to. It is 
against my nature." She looked up. 

"But you're my queen, and I thought you controlled 
me. I thought you had the power to command me." 

"I did control you," she said. "I always can. I just 
don't want to always. I want you to learn to control 
yourself. Learn what you need to do and not do. I am 
trying to teach you that. I cannot control you forever.
I don't want to keep controlling you. I want you to be
able to control yourself, and I don't think you will 
learn how to do that as long as you cannot control 
me." 

"That's your fault," I said. "You said you would never 
torture me. I don't see you torturing me. I don't see 
you using your power on me. I think you want me to 
learn to control myself." 

She smiled. "You're wrong. I do want you to learn to 
control yourself, but not by torturing you. I want you 
to become independent. If you learn to control 
yourself, then you will be independent." 

"That's not true," I said. 

"It is true," she said. "I need to learn what it is to 
not be everything in your life. I need to learn what 
it is to stand alone. But I have to give you the tools 
to learn how to stand on your own and also give you 
time to do it. We both have to learn how to stand on 
our own, or I have to give you the tools to do it. You 
don't want to do that." 

"No," I said. 

"No, I won't control you," she said. 

"Not control me?" I said. 

"You're a child, aren't you? All the women 
younger than you are. You need me to control you." 

"You control me just fine," I said. 

"But I was so easily controlled by Jahan," she said. 
"Why?" I asked. 

"Because I was a servant girl. I didn't see any of 
the things around me. I didn't really know what 
reality was. Jahan told me things that were real." 

"Real? He said it was real?" 

"He said you would tell me the things about me that 
made me what I am." 

"And what are they?" I asked. 

"The ones I find easiest to tell you are that I love 
you, and you do not love me. You do not want me. And 
that I don't want to control you. I am a master of 
self-control, or I would not be able to control you 
right now." 

"So I don't have a choice but to control you?" 

"For now, yes, but you must learn to see what is 
really going on and learn that we are not what we 
would have you think," she said. 

"What do you mean?" I asked. 

"I can feel something you don't," she said. "I know 
you would leave if I told you to, even if that is what 
you want. I know I would not leave. And that is what 
is the greatest control we have over one another. We 
cannot change our minds." 

"What do you mean?" I asked. 

"If you tell me I can't be here, then I will leave," she
said. "You have your powers back. Do not you?" 

I nodded. 

"If you tell me to stop, I will stop. If I am told not 
to touch you, I will stop. That is what your power 
comes down to. You cannot stop me from going unless 
I want to go, and you cannot stop me from touching 
you unless you want me to stop. You need to accept 
that." 

"Then you should be a servant to me. Not that I would 
allow you to tell me what to do. You must learn your 
place." 

"That isn't going to happen, and I will not allow you 
to make me your slave," I said. 

"That is how you think of me, is it?" she said. 

"I thought you could leave. I thought you would be 
my queen," I said. 

"And so you thought you must control me," she said. 
"What have I done to deserve this? I do what I am 
able to, that is all. I cannot control anyone. You 
made me and now you must live with that. I will try 
to do what I can, but I cannot command you, because 
if I command you, you will have to do it when I am 
not ready and that will go against what I want." 

"You don't seem so bad," I said. 

"Well, you don't see what I am really like," she said. 
"You know it is something terrible, and you don't 
know if it is true or not. I cannot help you if I do 
not know the truth." 

I looked away from her and didn't say anything for a </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:26
