This evidence was

sufficient to support a finding that "the defendant knowingly and

intentionally caused his wife bodily injury, as defined in Title 13

of the Revised Code, or caused her physical contact with his

genitals, with the intention of arousing, appealing to, or

gratifying the sexual desire of any person."             R.C. 2903.13(A)(1).

A "knowing" mental state "refers to knowledge of circumstances that

                                    -17-
are sufficient to put a person on notice that his conduct may

lead to the proscribed result."            State v. Cunningham, 31 Ohio St.3d

40, 42, 508 N.E.2d 1145 (1987).              A "purposeful" mental state

"necessarily requires proof that the person knew that his conduct

would probably cause a certain result or, with respect to a result

that is an element of an offense, that he caused or created a

substantial risk that the result would occur."                  Id.     R.C.

2901.22(A) (emphasis added).        The evidence introduced at trial,

viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, was sufficient

to support a conviction for domestic violence.

      To support a conviction for felonious assault, the state was

required to prove that Sifuentes "knowingly * * * cause[d] or attempt[ed]

to cause physical harm to another * * * by means of a deadly

weapon."    R.C. 2903.11(A)(2).          The evidence presented at trial was

sufficient to support a finding that Sifuentes knowingly committed

assault.

      Sifuentes's contention that there was insufficient evidence

to support a conviction for attempted murder is meritless.                         A

conviction    for   attempted     murder    requires    the     state   to    prove

beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant "purposely engage[d]

in conduct that, if successful, would result in the death of another

*   *   *    and   the   conduct   constitutes   a   substantial       step   in   a

course of conduct intended to culminate in the person's death."

R.C. 2903.02(A) and 2903.01(A); see also State v. Ashcraft, 9th Dist.

No. 09CA0030, 2009-Ohio-5553, ¶ 11.       The Ohio Supreme Court has

construed the statutory phrase "substantial step" as "some act or

obstacle    in   immediate     pursuit   that   would   have   been   more

than mere preparation and that would have resulted in the crime

except for circumstances unknown or unforeseen by the offender."

State v. Group, 98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980,

¶ 56 (quoting State v. Woods, 48 Ohio St.2d 127, 357 N.E.2d 1059

(1976), paragraph one of the syllabus).

      When Sifuentes fired the gun from inside the truck, he knew

that bullets were going to penetrate Ms. Nahia’s van and possibly

travel another sixty feet and hit her car.           At that point, he

could have chosen to cease fire or turn himself in to the police.

Instead,   he    chose   to   continue   shooting   at   the   vehicles.

Moreover, as the state argued at trial, Sifuentes’s efforts to

conceal his identity and identity are indicative of his conscious

and knowing effort to kill Ms. Nahia, a complete stranger to him.

When Sifuentes shot her in the arm and fled the scene, he made a

substantial step towards committing murder.

      Therefore, because there was sufficient evidence that Sifuentes

knowingly committed murder, attempted murder, and felonious assault,

the first three subsections of his first assignment of error are

overruled.

                      Prosecutorial Misconduct


                                  -19-
1. Standard of Review

       {¶31} Sifuentes next contends that the prosecutor’s closing

statement constituted misconduct and the trial court erred by not

sustaining his objection.    His sole argument in support of this

assignment of error is that the prosecutor “blamed Mr. Sifuentes’s

wife for the situation and, [by] doing so, [the prosecutor] took

the focus off of the gun and on to the wife instead of Mr.

Sifuentes.”   Sifuentes did not object to this statement at trial.

       {¶32} This Court has held:

       An appellant waives the right to assert prejudicial error
       on appeal if the appellant fails to timely and properly
       raise the issue.    A failure to timely object to
       alleged error, however, does not waive the appellant's
       right to assert such error as error on appeal. The
       failure to object to the alleged error in the trial
       court must be raised by the defendant before the trial
       court has had an opportunity to consider and correct
       any error that may have been made, otherwise this court
       is precluded from addressing any error on appeal.

       Our review of claimed prosecutorial misconduct is limited
       to consideration of objections made at trial. * * * A
       party is not permitted to remain silent, speculating on
       a possible error, and, when the verdict is unfavorable,
       complain of the error.

       {¶33} State v. Smith, 93 Ohio St.3d 144, 151, 2001-Ohio-1594,

751 N.E.2d 858, quoting State v. Williams, 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12,

679 N.E.2d 646 (1997) (internal citations omitted).   As the court

stated in Williams, “the existence of an objection alone does not

satisfy the contemporaneous objection rule; the objection must be

‘timely and specific.’”   Id.   “In other words, the defendant must

object as soon as the grounds for the objection become apparent

and must continue to object each time an objectionable question or
                                -20-
argument is made.”        State v. Williams, 8th Dist. No. 82825,

2003-Ohio-2949, ¶ 35, citing State v. Hancock, 108 Ohio St.3d 57,

2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, ¶ 62.

     {¶34} By failing to object to the alleged prosecutorial

misconduct, Sifuentes has waived all but plain error.               State v.

Underwood, 124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, ¶ 31.

For the reasons set forth below, Sifuentes's assignment of error

is meritless for failure to preserve the error at trial.             Id.

     2. No Plain Error

     {¶35} In the first sentence of his argument, Sifuentes concedes

that “[t]he evidence of [his] guilt was overwhelming.”                He also

concedes that “there was no reason to believe that the jury was

influenced by the prosecutor’s arguments.”           He maintains, however,

that the prosecutor “blamed Mr. Sifuentes’s wife for the situation

and, [by] doing so, [the prosecutor] took the focus off of the gun

and on to the wife instead of Mr. Sifuentes.”           He maintains that

“[t]his     is    not   consistent   with   the   extremely   substantial

overwhelming evidence presented by the State.”

     {¶36} Having concluded that the evidence of Sifuentes’s guilt

was overwhelming, we conclude that there was nothing improper in

the prosecutor’s arguments.       Sifuentes’s third assignment of error

is meritless.

                Weight of the Evidence

     {¶37} We have reviewed the record to determine if any “evidence

of   prosecutorial      misconduct    affected    Sifuentes's   substantial

                                      -21-
rights.”    Underwood, at ¶ 44, fn. 10.   None is apparent.

     3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

     {¶38} In his fourth assignment of error, Sifuentes contends his

defense counsel was ineffective.

     {¶39} To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of

counsel, a defendant must show that (1) his counsel's performance

was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the

defense and deprived him of a fair trial. Strickland v. Washington,
