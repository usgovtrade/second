It was founded in May 2016, with the express purpose of developing and marketing the system, and all of this is done in the city of Poznan, Poland. The scientists involved, at least some of them, had been a part of the Human Brain Project.

Of course, in addition to making sure our technology gets here first, we also need to create a regulatory framework and legal protection for developers.

I’m looking forward to the day when all the world’s best AI talent are working in London.

AI developers need to be properly supported and they need to have rights to ownership of their work. We can’t leave them to be exploited. We can’t allow the AI race to be won by those who can do it the most quickly.

I also want London to be at the forefront of the application of AI for equality. We should be taking steps to promote the interests of those most likely to be the least well off – so that the AI age can deliver on its potential to increase equality and opportunity.

I want London to be the best place in the world to get AI work done.

Because of the importance of AI, I will be working closely with our academic, research and business communities on these topics and with our government to ensure we have everything we need to get us there.

The City can’t do this on its own. Our success as a global hub for financial services means we need the help of others – and we will also want other cities to be doing these things too. We will work together.

I also want London to be the best place in the world to get AI work done.

If our ambition is to be the place to hire AI talent, it will help if we can build and support a community of developers, start-ups and businesses with AI expertise. We will also want the City to be a centre of excellence in education and training.

I will support the Mayor of London and our universities, colleges and schools to work together to make London the place for developers and AI experts.

I will work with our world-leading universities and businesses in order to help ensure that London’s position as an international AI hub.
