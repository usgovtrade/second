Quiet and quick, Quiggly slowly picked the lock and slowly turned the knob to open the door just a crack. The light switched on...and that’s when he saw the room. There was a room just the same as he remembered, but more of it. Where there used to be a single bed there were three, and where there was one window there were four and where there was one light bulb there were four and where there were a sink and a toilet that sat just opposite each other there were now six and where there was a big, beautiful, white table that has served the family for years, there were now seven. It was like a nightmare come to life, a perfect little reflection of Quiggly's own life. Quiggly was confused, but he could only look on in amazement. He didn't realize what happened, but he was suddenly caught up in the world of the three girls who’s names he never did know. He could only shake his head and wonder to himself why had no one told him about this before, this was his house after all.

Quiggly didn't hesitate but went directly to the first girl's room and saw her laying in her crib. The night had clearly seen her time of night for she was still in the middle of her last nap. She just had to stay asleep for now until she woke up later that morning, then he would have to introduce himself. Quiggly looked over at the other two. There was a set of twin girls sitting at their cribs. He didn't know their names either, but he was familiar with them from when they were babies and that is when he had left. Quiggly, as he gazed into their room, saw them both smiling at him; smiling very sweetly to him, not quite recognizing him. They had a bit more time then. Quiggly knew they would have a little time to tell them what they had found.

While Quiggly was in there, the sun was already beginning to set when two other brothers came in with his father. They also had the same black hair and bright blue eyes as he did. Just like in an animated Disney movie, the two brothers saw Quiggly walking up and down the halls with his hands clasped together as if in prayer. They had been there for a long time watching and listening as well. The two brothers watched with great care as Quiggly walked to his old room and closed the door behind him. What will Quiggly's thoughts be at that moment? Will he be sad? Or is he happy to be back? The brothers just stood there in the darkness just watching, not sure what to do, just like Quiggly himself. It was a bit more then they could handle right then, they knew something was about to happen, but what? After all, Quiggly was just their brother and never thought they would ever see him again. After Quiggly had seen what he wanted to see, he left the house through the back door and out the woods.

“I'm sorry for what happened,” said Quiggly as he reached the two brothers and started to close the door.

“Don’t be, Quiggly, they were doing what was right, and you know that. It's just that you don't come back...and why did you go?” the brothers asked.

“Yeah,” he replied, “I'm glad to be back too, because you're brothers.”

Quiggly looked behind him and saw the two brothers standing there, but one of them was a bit upset.

“Well, I don't know about that,” said one of the brothers, “I don't remember you at all.”

“Me neither,” the other replied.

“No one does,” answered Quiggly, “but it doesn't matter now.”

“Of course it doesn't matter now,” said one brother.

“We'll take care of you, Quiggly, that's why you're back,” said another, “now leave it to us.”

“We want to, so let's go,” another of them said.

“Okay,” said Quiggly and walked away.

They did not know what was happening inside the house, but Quiggly knew what he was going to do for it was not so hard to figure out. They were not so worried anymore. They knew what to do.

“Quiggly, what are you doing?” asked the brother, “What are you doing?!”

“I'm going,” said Quiggly, “I'm going to bring back our sister.”

“What?” they both exclaimed, “You're going to what?!”

“If you're so concerned about me, then there's something you should know, my name is not Quiggly, it's Alv,” answered Quiggly.

“What?” the brothers said in unison.

“They said Alv, Alv,” Quiggly said, “what was your name before? I'm really your brother, so that's how I knew.”

The brothers looked at each other with surprise, then shook their heads and smiled. They turned to look into the darkness once again.

“Of course I'm your brother, why did you ask?” one brother said.

“We knew it, but that wasn't much to do with why you left,” said another.

“Quiggly is only a name we knew you by, so we knew you were our brother, but that's about all we knew, so what is wrong?” another said, “You looked so happy to be back.”

“I think you'll know what's wrong very soon, because what we know and what we don't know all of it is in the past, it's over now.” Quiggly responded, “You don't have to know what I know, because it's between me and myself. Let me ask you one question, Quiggly, do you remember any of your past? They were a little girl and a little boy.”

Quiggly looked at the brothers with surprise, but they just looked back at him with the same surprised look.

“We only remember what we do know, but you do seem to remember a lot,” the first brother said.

“Like what we would call Alv, don't you see?” the second brother said.

“No,” Quiggly answered, “but I didn't mean any harm, I'm sorry that I came back and brought trouble, but I just had to.”

“Of course not, Quiggly, but that's not why I'm a little concerned.” Quiggly felt a bit nervous and he could see that his brothers were worried too.

“You're a little older then us, but how old are you anyway?” one of the brothers asked.

“A few more years older,” he said.

“It's okay, Quiggly, you don't have to explain yourself,” the brothers said, “Just stay with us for a while and let us take care of you, and you'll see that things will be alright. Your life will be good, but you have to know that we all want to help you. You’ve come back and brought trouble, we don't want anything to happen to you, but we still can't help you with it, because you're not a child anymore. We were never meant to be older, but you, that's another matter. You were chosen to do the Lord's work, that's what I think you're doing, so we just want you to be safe, that's all. Now what can we do for you, Quiggly?”

“Look, let's get going,” replied Quiggly.

“Wait! Just hold on for a second,” said one of the brothers.

“Quiggly,” said another brother, “how are we going to help you? We know nothing about the things that you're talking about.”

“I don't know how to help myself right now, and it's too late for me to change my mind, but I can help you, I can make sure you're safe, I can make sure you have what you want and you can have what you want. How do you think I made this happen? Now you have to trust me, you have to do what I tell you to, it's what I want. I can make your life much better than you think. I can make sure that you can be happy and make your dreams come true.”

“Quiggly, if I may ask you, do you really mean all this, do you really mean what you're saying, it all sounds so good, but how do I know that's the real Quiggly. You have that look again, that's not right, and you don't sound right.”

“Listen, Quiggly, I know you're not a liar, I'm really sure, but how do we know that's really you? I can't just believe you, so I want to make sure, that's all. You understand.”

“The first brother is right, there is a problem that needs to be fixed, you need to know who you are, so I think that's what you should do first, a sort of resetting of your memory. I would be willing to help you with that, I can see that something bad happened, but I can't</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:02
