How do I get the result of a SELECT COUNT(*) into a variable?

SELECT COUNT(*) INTO @cnt
FROM sometable;

doesn't work, apparently I have to declare a temp table, and then select * from that, which results in two queries. Is there a more efficient way to do this?

A:

There is, but beware:
If you use a WHERE clause in the original SELECT statement (the one that's actually selecting data), this COUNT won't return an accurate count (it'll return a smaller number).
SELECT @cnt = COUNT(*) FROM sometable WHERE somefield = @someValue;

A:

There is no way around SELECTing into a temporary table. In this example it could look something like this:
DECLARE @tmp INT
SELECT @tmp = COUNT(*) FROM sometable;
IF (@tmp > 0) INSERT INTO @tmp (somefield, someotherfield, ...)

A:

DECLARE @result INTEGER;
SELECT @result = COUNT(*) FROM @tablename;

This is assuming you have a table called @tablename and you are selecting into that table rather than a variable (@result).

If it's selecting into a variable, use this. 
DECLARE @result INTEGER;
SELECT @result = COUNT(*) FROM sometable;
SELECT @result;

The best way to read SQL is:

First, take what you think is the end result of the query (a single column table containing a single value) and put the query in between "SELECT * FROM" and "AS"
Next, take what you have in between "SELECT * FROM" and "AS" and assume that the previous table is now your new temporary table name

Let me know if you have any questions about that one.

UPDATE:
This works the same for any SELECT query:
DECLARE @result INTEGER;
SELECT @result = someColumn FROM sometable;
SELECT @result;

...but to be clear, if the query selects more than one column and/or returns more than one result, you are not doing a SELECT INTO as far as I know.
This last query doesn't actually do anything with @result unless you tell it to do so.

SELECT @result;
SELECT @result = 1 FROM sometable;

Now it's still the same as this.

UPDATE #2:
If you want to return a 0 in the case that a record isn't found, simply do it like this:
DECLARE @result INTEGER;
SELECT @result = COUNT(*) FROM sometable;
IF (@result > 0) SELECT @result;

Or like this:
DECLARE @result INTEGER;
SELECT @result = COUNT(*) FROM sometable;
IF (@result > 0) PRINT 'found';
ELSE PRINT 'not found';

I agree with the commenters that this is a horrible design pattern. When you find yourself implementing a counter variable like that, there's probably a better way to do what you are trying to do.

If you are using mysql 5.5 or above, you could try out the system function COUNT_STAR.
COUNT_STAR
If you specify ALL as an argument, the function returns a count of rows in the table regardless of the value of any column in the result set. 

So that query would look like this:
SELECT COUNT_STAR(*) FROM sometable;
