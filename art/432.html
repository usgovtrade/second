<OerHeks> !cookie | harris
<ubottu> harris: Wow! You're such a great helper, you deserve a cookie!
<Ben64> harris: please play elsewhere
<TJ-> harris: you need to explain your issue clearly and precisely, with specific examples. See the topic and instructions for how to get help
<k1l_> harris: please ask your question with as much details as possible. that will make everyone helping you easier.
<harris> aight but the question isn't good enough
<harris> i cannot tell the specific issue
<k1l_> harris: if you dont explain what you mean we cant help you.
<harris> i have issues with windows
<harris> i cant install windows on it
<harris> that is why i want to dualboot
<k1l_> harris: so you want dual boot? or you want a windows on another partition without a windows?
<TJ-> harris: the reason you don't have Windows (and the reason why the installer cannot be started) is because your boot partition has been damaged.
<k1l_> harris: so you have only ubuntu on your pc?
<harris> i have windows on a different partition but the boot files got damaged
<harris> yes
<harris> when i try to install windows i get an error
<harris> what i want is to either recover it or reformat it with ubuntu to dualboot
<k1l_> you mean you still have a windows on the hdd and then want to remove it?
<harris> I do
<harris> i had windows installed on the same partition but after formatting it it cant boot
<k1l_> harris: did you install ubuntu on a uefi/legacy bios system?
<harris> i have dual boot with ubuntu
<harris> now i tried to install it again and it doesnt boot
<harris> and no, its installed in legacy bios
<harris> how can I prevent the boot file form getting damaged when i format
<k1l_> harris: so there is not "dualboot" partition with ubuntu on it?
<harris> i am trying to install windows into a partition that has ubuntu but the boot file got damaged while formatting
<harris> so now it doesnt get damaged
<k1l_> harris: "damaged"?
<TJ-> harris: the reason you cannot install Windows on a partition where Ubuntu was installed is because Windows over-writes the boot sector
<TJ-> harris: so how do you plan to install Windows whilst another OS is already running the PC, in the same partition?
<k1l_> harris: yes. which is you do not install windows on another partition than the ubuntu one.
<Ben64> harris: use windows to restore the boot sector, and do it from inside windows
<k1l_> harris: so you might want to get used to windows first.
<Ben64> thats the easy solution
<k1l_> or boot a live usb and look at the hdd. if its damaged, that needs a backup.
<harris> I DONT WANT TO USE WINDOWS THAT IS WHY I AM INSTALLING IT SEPARATELY BUT IT DOESNT GET INSTALLED
<harris> DOESNT WORK
<Ben64> dude, get help elsewhere
<k1l_> harris: use the correct language and stop it with the caps, please.
<k1l_> harris: first get a windows cd, then use the recovery.
<harris> ok but windows doesnt get installed
<harris> and its not detected my recovery partition either
<harris> so it cant do any repair
<k1l_> harris: and why cant it be repaired when you boot a windows cd in the drive?
<k1l_> harris: stop the drama please and either make sure ubuntu isnt in that partition or that is the only partition. then ask for help how to repair the windows
<harris> yes it is the only partition
<k1l_> harris: you still need a windows cd to repair.
<Ben64> harris: or you could just not use windows
<harris> and the ubuntu isntalled in legacy bios
<k1l_> harris: and what tells you that windows is the only partition? you need a program for that.
<k1l_> harris: what is "gparted"?
<harris> yes
<k1l_> harris: go find a windows repair cd and use it.
<harris> it doesn't tell me that
<k1l_> its not a joke to have a hdd with such a file system and linux installed.
<k1l_> and its not my fault that you dont want to know how to use a windows cd to repair windows
<harris> i know it
<k1l_> then it can be repaired. and i even told you what that program is.
<harris> I DONT HAVE THE CD
<k1l_> harris: stop it with the drama.
<harris> the file system got damaged while formatting
<k1l_> !windows | harris
<ubottu> harris: For discussion on Microsoft software, or help with same, please visit ##windows. See http://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/1 http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm and /msg ubottu equivalents
<TJ-> k1l_: I agree, harris is being unreasonable
<k1l_> harris: please do the reading on this. you have a 3rd party program called "gparted" from the repos. you can use it to solve your issue: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal#Windows_Terminal
<harris> that is not the point
<TJ-> harris: the partition that harris installed windows on is the wrong partition.
<TJ-> harris: how many partitions are on the hard disk?
<harris> one
<harris> it is linux only
<harris> the windows is another partition
<harris> the one i have dual boot
<TJ-> harris: Windows was in /dev/sda1  and your Ubuntu install was in /dev/sda2 ?
<harris> yes
<TJ-> harris: in that case, you're looking at an issue with your windows installation
<TJ-> harris: fix it using a repair install CD/DVD
<k1l_> or you just want to use the command prompt
<TJ-> harris: using the Windows installation DVD or USB, reinstall the Windows boot-strap loader to /dev/sda1
<TJ-> harris: that will solve the issue.
<harris> yes but when it is installed in legacy bios it doesn't get installed because it cannot detect boot files
<harris> what is the difference between legacy and uefi bios
<TJ-> harris: no
<TJ-> harris: it needs to be installed in UEFI
<k1l_> harris: yes. if you remove the ubuntu-partition the bootloader goes with it and he can not boot the windows.
<TJ-> harris: if you want to put Windows on the same disk, use a different partition
<harris> but when I use legacy bios mode it cannot detect the boot partition
<TJ-> harris: if you want to install Windows you should *ALWAYS* take Windows' recovery CDs and recovery DVDs, or USB
<k1l_> harris: no it cant. so stop it with the drama and put your windows cd and restore the windows bootloader from the windows cd into the windows partition
<harris> so how can I fix the boot file issue
<k1l_> (since you do know how to do that from a cd/dvd )
<harris> if I use gparted it cannot detect the boot file either
<k1l_> harris: show us the screenshot of the ubuntu partiton where you said that you have the issue
<harris> my partition is locked
<harris> the live CD
<harris> it does not even load
<harris> its stuck
<harris> it shows purple
<TJ-> harris: you can check for the partition locked by using a tool like "disk-unlocker" from a liveISO
<k1l_> harris: yes. you need to show a screenshot
<k1l_> so he can see what you are talking about
<k1l_> that is the point of a screenshot
<harris> I DONT HAVE THE CD
<k1l_> put that cd and install a program that shows the actual installed programs. not "ubuntu" but the partitions
<harris> can I format from ubuntu using the terminal
<harris> i cannot show a screenshot i cannot get ubuntu to load
