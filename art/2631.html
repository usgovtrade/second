This page is only for iOS users.If you do not have Apple ID, please sign up to create an account.

Your Apple ID will be used to validate your ownership and to set up your billing. Once validated, you can log in with the same Apple ID later and get your license key. The Apple ID used in this instance should be different from the one used to set up the payment.

To complete the installation, please choose "Install" from the following two options.

Once you have selected either method, Apple will show the details of your purchase and a temporary license code will be given to you.

Note that, by the end of the day, you can choose to use the full functionality of the app and pay for it. You will be given a full license code with which you can sign in using a web browser.

Purchase Apple Developer Program and obtain an Apple ID

If you are already a registered Apple Developer, you can log in and obtain your license keys via the "Install" option, above.

If you are not already a registered Apple Developer, you can either sign up here to create an Apple ID or skip that option and request to purchase the program here.

Once you are successfully registered as an Apple Developer, please log in to the iTunes Connect. From the Purchases section, you can view your purchases and activate the license for all purchases.

Once a purchase is activated, you can view the activation code in your My Account section and use it to validate your ownership for this particular purchase.

Please note that, in order to activate a license for the app, you will need to sign in with the same Apple ID you have used to purchase and install the app.

If you encounter any issues, we encourage you to contact Apple Developer Support at support@toucharcade.com. Please be sure to include your name, the name of your app, and the purchase receipt.

If you purchase the app before the first day of launch, you will receive the iOS license through the Apple Developer Program. If you purchase the app after the first day of launch, you will receive the iOS license through the store itself. You can learn more about the difference in purchases here.

Please keep in mind that you will receive the iOS app under your own name.

You will need to provide the correct app name. If you are only changing the name of the app, you need to log in with your Apple ID to your account, choose "edit" next to the app name, and change it to match the new name of the app.

You will need to provide your developer's credit card information for the purchase. For new purchases of $100 or more, Apple will provide you with the option to charge your Apple ID with an invoice via Paypal. You can find more information about it here.

You will need to provide a developer’s credit card or other payment method. The payment information will remain on file with Apple if you use your own payment method. When you do use another payment method, Apple will charge the payment method on file and that method will be charged for this particular purchase. You can change the payment method if you change the payment method in your Apple ID.

Please keep in mind that the credit card information on file is required only for the purchase, not for any future purchases or updates.

Please note that the "developer" that is signing up to the app store is not the owner of the app but rather a legal representative. The owner of the app needs to sign in as well. If you do not have an Apple ID, create one here.

If you are a US developer, please go to iTunes Connect, choose "Account" then "Sales and Trends" to view sales. At the top right of this page, you can "view purchases". Click on the "Purchase History" and you can see the purchase history for your app. Select the purchase that you made for iOS and you can see the Apple ID that was used to purchase. On the next screen, you can send this email to the owner of the app and ask them to sign in with the same Apple ID you used for the purchase. Please include your name, the name of the app, and the purchase receipt.

Thank you for choosing TouchArcade! We’re looking forward to being a part of your game development success!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:49
