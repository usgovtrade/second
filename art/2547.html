The man's mother has told police that her son was being treated for mental problems.

The suspect is a resident of the same village where the other teenager, named in local media as Alexandre Brice, killed himself with a gunshot wound to the head in the early hours of Monday morning.

Brice's killing sparked protests in the community. His suicide was the third such event there in the last month.

A judicial inquiry has been launched into Brice's death, but local people accuse the government of doing nothing.

On Tuesday, protests by local residents became violent and several people were arrested.

Police responded by opening fire with tear gas to disperse crowds of protesters.

Some of those injured in the demonstrations are being treated in hospital for gunshot wounds, the French newspaper Le Parisien reported on Tuesday.

At least one of them is said to be in a serious condition.

Amid ongoing unrest, President Francois Hollande visited the victims' hometown on Tuesday afternoon.

At a news conference, he said authorities have been "doing everything to calm the situation," stressing that "it is the responsibility of the state to prevent this situation from getting worse."

He also promised to review how emergency services respond to such incidents.

He said French authorities are currently working on a plan to reform the current law on public order, which is up for debate in parliament later this week.

Minister: Tragedy 'will not lead us to change the law'

At a news conference on Tuesday morning, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said the government "has the means to respond to such situations."

Castaner said the Interior Ministry's prefecture in Aude, home to the victims' village, was working with the village's associations on a response plan for such tragedies.

"The government has all means at its disposal to respond to such situations in order to contain risks and prevent tragedies," he said. "This tragedy should lead us to reflect on how the law is currently applied. ... Unfortunately, it is not always possible to react as fast as people would like.

"But we cannot say, with one or two tragedies, that this will lead to a change in French law. This tragic incident will not lead us to change the law."

Castaner accused locals of trying to create a "porno effect" by sending the video of the killing online.

The incident comes a day after a similar violent protest against police brutality. In Perpignan, on the French Mediterranean coast, several dozen protesters attacked officers, set fire to a local building, and tried to block roads and bridges in the area.

Protesters said police brutally beat a man earlier in the week and did nothing when a woman was raped in the same district.

The area's police chief has said he is going to present his resignation to the interior minister.

In other incidents over the past week, eight people died and two were left seriously injured after violence involving young people spread across the country.

French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner addresses reporters on Saturday at a police station in Nantes, where officials from the Paris Prosecutor's Office are investigating the killing of a young black man in a suburb of the city.

The dead man, 24-year-old Aboubakar Fofana, was seen as the chief suspect in his killing. He was killed in a car on the outskirts of Nantes late on August 29.

Prosecutors say he was wearing dark clothing, which made him a target, and were questioning people who knew him to understand what happened.

Violent deaths linked to drugs in France, other European nations

Several countries have seen sudden spikes in violence involving youths with alleged mental health problems and drugs.

In Greece, several dozen youths, including some reportedly armed with knives, took part in an "attack" on police. In the ensuing violence, one officer and a 16-year-old teenager were shot dead by police fire.

In Paris, several dozen youths burned cars, torched garbage containers and fought with police at barricades in response to the death of a 21-year-old man who fell from a fifth-floor balcony. Police said he was a known drug user and may have been trying to escape from officers.

One of the men who died in the French riots was named by a witness as Kamel, 20, the French news agency AFP reported.

A 23-year-old man was arrested in connection with the death of the young man, according to prosecutors. The suspect was hospitalized after being injured in a clash with police who had stopped his car.

Other deaths were reported in Nantes on Sunday, including one by a man who shot himself after he was run over. His death was later deemed suspicious.

In Britain, several people were reported to have been seriously injured in a fight with police in broad daylight in Birmingham on Sunday.

In Germany, a 20-year-old man died after being stabbed by a police officer in the town of Neuruppin on Sunday.

And in Belgium, seven people died in several incidents over the weekend.

Three of the seven people were shot and killed by police in Brussels in the latest surge of violence in the French capital.

The riots came as the city celebrated its annual gay pride parade, when a group of people stormed a bar and killed two men.

Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel has said he is ashamed and in "mourning" for his country after the shooting.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:41
