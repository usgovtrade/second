Runnin’ through your emotions
And I know you can’t escape them
Now if you wanna get involved
It’s all in your head

‘Cause I got a lot going on, so just bear with me
I’m thinkin’ you’re ready to see that
You’re just here until you’re gone
You’re here until you’re gone

Yeah, you know, you’ve got that attitude
But can’t you do better than runnin’ from it?
Yeah, you know, you got that attitude
But you can’t outrun it
You’re here until you’re gone
You’re here until you’re gone
You’re here until you’re gone
You’re here until you’re gone

I have to say that I actually listened to this song again a few days ago and I was again surprised that I had not noticed before how much of an effect the singer’s tone of voice has on me.
To be precise, when he sings the phrase "you’re here until you’re gone", it strikes a chord in my heart that is reminiscent of The Beatles song "Here, There and Everywhere".
It strikes me even more when you put in the rhythm:
"‘Cause I got a lot goin’ on" is somewhat "you’ve got a lot of people depending on you" and "...it’s all in your head" is "now if you want to get involved"

A:

I have never been able to decipher those words, but here's my take.

"You’re here until you’re gone" refers to someone's stay in a place, whether temporary or long-term.

"I have to say that I actually listened to this song again a few days ago" refers to the fact that we are all transient by our very nature. We all take the place of someone or something else at some point in our lives, and we all eventually go away.
If we're fortunate, someone else takes our place, but ultimately, it is we who must leave our place, whether voluntarily or by the forces of nature.
So, really, we are all transient, no matter how much we wish not to be.

"‘Cause I got a lot going on, so just bear with me" refers to the fact that we are also transient, whether voluntary or not.
It isn't only humans that can bear with us. Animals that see us as transient as we are can bear with us. The mountains, the trees, the animals can bear with us if we go too far.

We can't outrun it.
We are all transient.

So, if someone tries to "get involved" with you, maybe that's because they think that you will be a more permanent fixture in their lives than you really will be.
And maybe they are right.
I really don't know what he means, but I enjoy the song's melodies and rhythm.

A:

I believe that the song was written and recorded on the same day.  It would seem as if he was trying to explain to his significant other that his emotions were based in the past, and he wanted them to move on, get over it, or whatever.
The second half of the song speaks for itself, but you may want to think about that the first verse refers to her past as well, and not just him.

How would he not see or notice her tone of voice? Maybe it would be easier to understand if the singer was talking. 
My gut feeling is that this song is about the singer finally ending a relationship. He may not want to admit it, but she is clearly not happy for the future they are building together. He doesn't really make sense anymore, he doesn't have a home in her "world" anymore. 
She has had to bear with him for too long, in which he let his own baggage keep them apart. She was hoping he would grow up a bit before ending the relationship and moving on with his life. They never really were the right for each other, they were both just hanging on because they couldn't think of a better alternative. The world kept on moving on around them, and this really drove them apart. They couldn't even see that they had let the world move on without them.

So, really, we are all transient, no matter how much we wish not to be.

This is not a bad thing, it is just the way we are. You can either be with the world, or against it. A lot of people find themselves in a bind by finding that they don't have anything in common with the people around them. We can't keep being the same person we have always been. No matter how much we want to stay that way.

  "I have to say that I actually listened to this song again a few days ago and I was again surprised that I had not noticed before how much of an effect the singer's tone of voice has on me.

She doesn't want to think about this, or hear about this. She feels that he should have moved on, and is not understanding that he is trying to help her do the same thing. She is clinging to his every word, and he wants to stop dealing with her baggage.

"‘Cause I got a lot going on, so just bear with me"
"You’re here until you’re gone"
"You’re here until you’re gone"

She needs to stop dwelling on the past.
He has done everything to try to help her, but she refuses to accept it. She doesn't want to accept that he is doing this for her own good.

The first time they get together. He wants to get out of the past, but she refuses to accept that he is doing this for her own good. 

"‘Cause I got a lot goin’ on, so just bear with me"
"You’re here until you’re gone"
"You’re here until you’re gone"

She does not realize that he loves her as much as he does, and he is trying to help her move on.
