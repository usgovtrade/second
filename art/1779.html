In you, O Lord, I have taken refuge.

Psalm 34

1-2 Hear the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for mercy
and for justice.

3-4 Do not delay, O Lord, with your awesome power and Your
righteousness.

5-7 Do not be very angry with your people and destroy them.

8-9 Remember, O Lord, your favored land, for the enemy has
violated it.

10-12 Protect the weak and the fatherless, and take care of
widows and orphans.

13-15 Deliver me from evil neighbors who say, “Aha, O
Hebrews! We got you!” or else my blood will be required.

16-17 Be a stronghold for me, O Lord God of Jacob.
I shall take refuge in You from the oppression of mighty nations.

18-19 O Lord, come quickly to help us, for we are suffering
from the plots of our enemies.

20-22 O Lord, do not stay angry with us forever.
You know our strengths and our weaknesses.

Psalm 35

1-2 Let us all be glad in the Lord, for he is our strength and
our praise.

3-4 Have you found your enemy, O Lord, and did you kill him?

5-6 Let your hand be lifted up against your foes, and your
righteousness against their sins.

7-9 Give me justice, O God, and righteousness.
Because of you I stand with dignity.

10-12 Why should the wicked live, for they do not cry out to you?
You see the wicked in the safe darkness where they lie.
But into the hands of the Lord our God the wicked shall fall.

13-14 O Lord, see my affliction, for I am being crushed by my
enemies.

15-16 Take me out of the wicked, and deliver me from the evil
men.

17-18 Then I will thank You and praise You for ever. You will
hold me and take care of me.

19-20 Because of God’s promise I will not despair or be
overwhelmed. Though my enemies attack me, they shall not prevail.

21-22 Because I have sought out Your face, O Lord, You will be
my strength and my fortress.

Psalm 36

1-3 Give ear to my prayer, O Lord; give attention to my pleas.

4-7 I am worn out with crying, and I have no hope left of my
salvation.

8-9 But I trust in You, O Lord, for You do answer my prayers.

10-11 So I will praise You for the Lord is good, for He is our
rescue. In Him there is no sin.

12-15 Therefore I will sing praises to You and I will dance for
joy. Because Your loyal love to me was more than my enemies’ hatred.

16-18 Even though they were more numerous, they are destroyed.
I did not forget You, O Lord, for I wanted to tell all your
works.

19-21 You destroyed the unrighteous rulers and wicked kings.
But out of my distress, I called upon the Lord.

22-23 O God, please don’t turn away from me. Don’t keep an angry
spirit against me forever. But don’t give me more pain than my
pain already is.

Psalm 37

1-3 Trust in the Lord and do good. Seek his presence, and he
will be found.

4-5 Call out to him and he will hear you. Speak his name, and
he will respond.

6-8 He will lead you along the right paths for your own good.

9-10 For the Lord your God is a fountain of life, a well of
sustenance for every living being.

11-12 Give heed to him, O you, my people. Let his teaching guide
you and earn your trust.

13-14 Not only in Egypt, O Lord, have we perished, but also in
Egypt our slaves shall be slaves.

15-16 O Lord, hear our prayer. We entreat for help in Your
presence.

17-18 Teach us to believe in Your lovingkindness, O Lord. Save
us for the sake of Your name.

19-20 Deliver us, O Lord our God, for there is no one to save
for us. Have mercy upon us.

21-22 O Lord, you are our Father; we are the clay and you are
the potter.

23-25 Don’t forget that we are dirt, and to dust we shall
return.

26-27 Create a new heart within us, O God. Don’t cast us off.

28-29 Remember, O Lord, the children of your chosen people,
those who are your treasured possession. You make us lie down in
dust. You let us rise up again.

30-31 Teach us to follow your way, O Lord. Give us grace for
your names’ sake.

32-33 Let your tender mercies make our feet like wings, so that
we may quickly fly to you. For you are our God, and we trust you.

33-35 Let us tell of your lovingkindness, for that is what
we have done. Your law is within us. Your presence is right
before our eyes.

34-37 Make us glad with the joy of your presence, O God. Let us
teach those who are to fear you.

38-39 Those who love your name will be richly blessed. Those
who forget you will be ashamed.

40-41 O Lord, be gracious to us. Don’t hold us up to shame. For
your law is righteous. You are just, O Lord, for all your dealings.

42-44 Don’t let the evildoers fool you and lead you away from
your way. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they will inherit
the land.

43-44 Blessed are the humble, for they will inherit the land.

45-48 Don’t repay evil for evil. Don’t let the one who does
evil go unpunished. Don’t let the evil in your sight be unpunished.

49-50 Rebuke the devourer. Devour the flesh of your opponents
and do not let the devil have them.

51-52 A sinner is caught in the trap and held by his own wicked
deeds. Yes, he is trapped, and he will die in his misdeeds.

53-54 Save a righteous man from trouble. Be kind to him, for
there is hope.

55-57 Do good to the house of the Lord. He is gracious and will
save you. The Lord is pleased by your gift.

58-59 Let us pray for the peace of Jerusalem and the welfare of
Israel.

60-62 O our God, don’t let those who are cruel and violent oppress
them. Don’t give them the land and they won’t be able to use it.

63-64 Don’t hand it over to their rebellious hands. Let them
not put up obstacles, or they will soon be turned away.

65-66 Let all in our land give thanks to you, O Lord, for you are
mighty. You are good, and your love is eternal.

Psalm 38

1-4 O God, my God, why have you abandoned me? Why are you
turning a deaf ear to my call?

2-3 My God, how long will you ignore me? For ever? Will you
break my heart?

4-6 I give thanks for a gracious death. O death, where is your
victory? By your power, O death, you were defeated.

7-8 O Shepherd of Israel, don’t stay at home with those who
bleed.

9-10 With those who are in distress and pain, come to save us.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:30
