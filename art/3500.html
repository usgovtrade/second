"Sweat from all over me and my face was getting warm, the cool breeze made me even hotter. My heart rate was beginning to increase to a point that I was ready to explode. Every second, my body tried to jump up and run away from him. I couldn't believe I was so drawn to him, to want him more than I wanted any other girl I had been with before. I was mesmerized by his smile, his dimples and his warm brown eyes. I wanted to jump up and embrace him but my legs wouldn't move."

His beautiful green eyes were watching every move of mine. It was like he was a little confused at first. I had no idea where I was or what I was doing, so naturally, his face showed a look of confusion. But then, his smile just made me melt into a puddle of sweat. I didn't think this was possible but I felt my clothes slowly burning off me. My shirt hung over my skin but had a layer of fabric. I hoped to God that I wasn't blushing. But then again, his eyes were so close. I could feel my heart beat in every pore in my body. His skin was so smooth and smelled like vanilla bean scented candles. I breathed him in deep, trying to take in his aroma.

"Oh!" I sighed in exhilaration.

"So, it's been like this all along?"

He nodded his head and smiled. I wanted to reach out and grab his arms and pull him towards me. He stopped himself and looked at me, so I could not tell if he had any clue as to what I wanted. In a very calm and composed voice, he asked "do you want me to kiss you?" He knew what I wanted. And he liked to get me off.

I bit my lip, almost scared to death of what was about to happen, but knowing at the same time that I really did want this to happen.

"Yes" I breathed. I still didn't believe I could do this but he was going to make me a believer!

I started to lose my heart to him. I looked up and stared into his brown eyes, and I wanted him more than anything. He smiled and then moved in closer. He leaned forward and brought his lips toward mine. I closed my eyes and gave into my desires. His cold lips touched my cheek and were warm and soft. It felt like an eternity but soon enough, he was going to kiss my lips, maybe this kiss was only so that he could touch my lips, only for a second, just long enough for the heat to start and radiate in my very core. That was when I felt the tip of his hot, thick and rough tongue slowly approach my lips.

"Ooh..." I sighed, "yes, aah!" I felt the tip of his tongue brush against my bottom lip and slowly open my lips. I closed my eyes. The only words that left my mouth were "Eeeuw!"

He pulled back and let out a small chuckle. He smiled with his eyes. And said, "I'm sorry."

"Sorry? You've got to be kidding me," I replied, "you just made me weak in the knees."

"I'm sorry!" he said again, not showing any signs of regret. He leaned in and kissed me once more.

Our lips met, my heart was pounding like a crazy woman. It was such a feeling of relief that I couldn't keep up the conversation. As he leaned in to kiss me for the third time, the wind hit my face and he whispered in my ear. "So many people have been in and out of your life, but I've always been there, right here, whenever you needed me. I feel like a lost, lonely soul who couldn't find my own way back home. And now, I'm just glad I found you."

I could feel a tear rolling down my cheek as he spoke. I leaned into him, wrapped my arms around his neck and gave him the kiss of a lifetime.

Chapter 2

I knew she was supposed to be here tonight. I could feel it. I just didn't know where she was and now, I couldn't tell if it was me, or someone else making this crazy noise in the depths of my soul. She wanted me and I knew it. She has always been the love of my life, the air I breathe, the reason I was even alive, but she was right there. Just out of reach.

I tried to see where she was hiding herself but I couldn't find her. I called out her name and hoped that she would just magically appear. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I exhaled slowly, feeling my body relax. I knew that I had to have this girl's body, soul, my future baby mama!

It felt so good to be back here. Her place was my home away from home. There was no place on earth I would rather be than right where I was at right now. I had found that she was out and about in the clubs, she just wouldn't give me her number.

"Are you ready for some more" he asked, "we can start off slow if you want?" he winked and smiled. He had that little crooked, dimpled smile that I thought would drive me crazy with the feelings he caused inside of me. His words were music to my ears.

"Now?" I asked, "You mean like in the backseat of a car?"

"Is that what you want? We can do whatever you want baby.

"Well..." I paused for a moment. The feeling of his body pressed against me, so close and warm, his soft breath falling from his lips as his hands snaked their way around my waist. I wanted to be completely with him.

I closed my eyes and said "I'll follow you anywhere." I closed my eyes and let out a deep breath. I had never done this before. I knew that I shouldn't be doing this and now, I'm not sure if it was really as right as I felt it to be. There was a slight hesitation from him, but I just figured that maybe he had been out of the game for a while. He is an exceptional man, and knows exactly how to take me and make me feel loved and cared for. He gently grabbed me and started pulling me out of the chair.

"Where are we going?"

"Do you trust me?"

"Yes" I replied.

"You're gonna have to trust me then," he paused, "There's only one thing I know for sure, and that is when you feel it, everything else is going to follow, don't push it or question what we're doing."

I smiled. He was so confident, so understanding. His self-confidence was incredible. He looked into my eyes and whispered "so it's gonna be me tonight? Are you sure that's what you want?"

"Yes" I replied.

"You don't want me to stop?" he asked.

"Are you kidding?"

"Not at all," he replied and smiled at me, he then moved his hand up my shirt to my breast. He grabbed it and started to pinch it slightly.

"Ouch" I groaned. It felt great. He then placed his lips on my ear and said "trust me," I didn't feel like moving or backing down. I wanted him so bad, and I would be lying if I said that I didn't.

"Don't do that," he started, "Your body is not an object and it doesn't belong to you, you can't have it, you will never own me, I'm in control here, only mine, but you do have the ability to please</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:23
