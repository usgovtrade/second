Today Bandai Namco officially announced that Fist of the North Star: Ken’s Rage 2 will be present at Gamescom next week, but they also revealed the name of the Japanese limited edition of the game, named “Founder’s Edition”.

The base game itself will be enhanced with three in-game items:

Custom-made Steelbook Case (Included)

Chivalry Earphones

Ken and His Partner Mug

As for the European edition, nothing has been announced yet.

In case you’re curious, the game was announced at Bandai Namco’s own Summer Festival at Reitaisai 2015. You can check out the latest gameplay trailer and a few screenshots past the cut.

[Original Story]

Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe has announced that Fist of the North Star: Ken’s Rage 2 will be present at Gamescom next week. The publisher didn’t share anything else on the matter.

The same week, a Fist of the North Star event was also announced for Tokyo Game Show, which will take place from September 15 to 18.

It’s not much, but it’s something at least. Gamescom is generally recognized as being a much bigger event than TGS, so it’s likely that the latter may attract a much larger audience due to the sheer number of people in attendance.

Fist of the North Star: Ken’s Rage 2 will be available in 2015 in Japan, North America and Europe. In Europe the game is already available for pre-order on the Playstation Store.

At the moment, there’s no information about a Collector’s Edition for the game. If you’re interested, you can check out more on the game’s Amazon page, as you can see the listing is region free, even though it doesn’t appear to be available in Europe.
