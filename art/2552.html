If you are an offender of an OWI/DUI, you might have the wrong perception that a license suspension for your OWI/DUI offense is a punishment that only people on the receiving end of this offense gets to undergo. Some may also not realize that a suspension for an OWI/DUI may affect more than just one's driving privileges as it may also require that the offender enroll in a program like the OWI (Alcohol Safety Action Program). This would include completion of a victim impact panel, alcohol assessment program, and attendance of alcohol treatment classes, among others. If you find yourself in this situation, contact a professional that has the expertise necessary to give you the support you need to not only get over this offense, but to keep yourself safe as well.

Drug Offender Incarceration. Lawyers at our firm handle clients with various types of criminal charges in the courts around Los Angeles County, including drug offenses. This can include marijuana charges, selling or manufacturing of dangerous drugs or driving under the influence of drugs.

Possession of Substances Prohibited. These may include illegal narcotics and even marijuana. This may also be a parole or probation violation when drugs were involved in the original offense. This will likely be handled in criminal court, but there may be conditions on probation that will need to be satisfied in addition to paying any fines and court costs. The amount of probation will depend on the nature of the case and other factors.

Domestic Violence - This may be charged as a domestic violence crime or a criminal violation under Penal Code section 273.5, assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury or a felony under Penal Code section 245, simple assault.
