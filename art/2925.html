This Week’s Drinking Game! I’m pretty sure this week’s “drinking” game is one “beer.” Any episode that features the cast doing a parody of Jersey Shore is an almost certainly sure bet for a game of beers. On this week’s episode, Pauly’s character is actually doing what his character on the show would be doing in the off-season for this show, and it involves a lot of beer! Let’s give it a shot, shall we?

Tune in to an all new season of The Challenge: Total Madness when it premieres Tuesday February 9th @ 9/8C on MTV! For now, check out the cast for Total Madness.

What do you think of this cast, HollywoodLifers? Do you think the cast will have any drama when they get down to business? Hit the comments and let us know!

I think that this is the most drama-less season so far. I would say this is definitely going to be a good season! It should be entertaining to watch. I really enjoyed this cast. Lacey was nice, but not my favourite. I really enjoyed that she did the dance but after that she didn’t seem to care anymore. Most people just didn’t care anymore. Most people weren’t really playing any games but a couple were and it was fun to watch how the people played their games. I really wish there could have been an episode all teams against each other just to see what the real contestants were like. Overall, I really enjoyed this season and I think it will be a great season! This is definitely a good season!!! Bring on next season!

I really didn’t like this season at all. I really wish they could have focused on just a few people. I don’t know if I like Lacey or not. I love Pauly though. This season was way too predictable for me. This season made me very upset that people had to die because of it. I think next season should be all about the boys and girls competing again. At the end of the day, that’s all I really wanted to see this season.

YEA BABY !!! This is going to be a awesome season.I loved the whole show from start to finish.Lacey is my absolute favorite cast member out of all of them.She is the one to beat this season.I love that they are going to have a bunch of guys and girls they have never seen before.It is time to party !!!!!!!!

This was a very disappointing final cast! I loved Lacey, and was looking forward to her being in this season, but after reading the cast list, I was surprised! She is such a wonderful person, and a great choice for a contestant on this show. The boys don’t even know how lucky they are to have her! I am looking forward to her dominating the game! This was a good cast, and I was rooting for every one of the guys, but I just don’t think this was a good season.

i have watched all of the new challenge and i am still very disappointed in you MTV and the way you pick the cast because this is not a cast of all guys and women but rather your usual choice of people like this is what bothers me so bad its like you want to show pauly with the worst people he gets on his show. all i can say is MTV better get a lot of female viewers and more guys like the last couple of shows because this season is not gonna last that long and most of the people you picked for the show would have been cut by that time.

I absolutely hated how the show was structured. It was so predictable. It felt so samey at times. All the girls got involved in it, which was fine, but it’s also so predictable, and predictable can sometimes feel forced and unnatural. It made me feel bad for the cast as a whole. I think most people will just ignore the games and give alliances no thought at all. Most people just don’t care anymore. I loved the idea of everyone getting along, and I liked Paull and Lacey’s game play, but I just felt that they had to go into each season like that. There has to be a huge surprise and everyone has to make big moves and get in over their heads and it has to be surprising, but now it feels so fake and fake. It feels like when I watch other reality shows like Survivor and that it’s so much</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:53
