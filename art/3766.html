It also seeks to educate people “about new types of voting that go beyond voting at a poll station or voting via mail, by allowing citizens to vote online, using mobile phone, fax or other systems of communication.”

To that end, the website features the following videos:

The new ad is a direct response to the recent efforts by California secretary of state Alex Padilla’s, who has moved aggressively to tighten voting regulations and close poll stations in heavily minority areas.

According to JWZ:

California Secretary of State Alex Padilla is behind some of the most restrictive voting restrictions in the country. His attempts to change voting requirements and close polling places have disproportionately impacted the minority community. We will have to continue to fight until all Californians have the right to vote.

Earlier this month, Padilla announced that his office will no longer accept the ballots of Californians whose names are not in the state’s master voter list.

In October, the California Department of Motor Vehicles notified 3.5 million voters that their voter registrations had been cancelled due to the lack of recent activity, a failure to respond to the DMV or confirm the voter’s address, or because they failed to vote over the past six years.

“They told people they have to ‘confirm’ their voter status with DMV,” Padilla said at a press conference held during last year’s election. “That’s why we have a $54 million budget to help people confirm that they are on the voter rolls.”

As PJM previously reported, in New York City, the Republican mayoral candidate Paul Massey was arrested during the election last year for standing in front of the polling place and shouting at voters, “Why don’t you vote for me, I’m a Republican!”

The voter suppression efforts in California and other states are based on the false premise that the only way to determine a person’s identity is by his or her driving records. But a new generation of identification documents that include personal fingerprints, retinal scans, or tattoos and/or biometric data offer better accuracy and more control than anything DMV can generate. In addition, voters should remember that casting a valid vote does not require going to a polling place. If they have already taken out a California drivers license or identification card or received a voter registration card, they can use that ID to vote. They can also obtain a State of California voter identification card by visiting their local county elections office and by calling the office to find out more about voter registration, or visit here. And if they still haven’t yet registered to vote, there is no reason for them to fear that DMV will notify the registrar’s office that they are ineligible to vote.

While California may be ground zero for the battle to control the voting process, as JWZ notes, it is just the latest battleground state to push voting laws that favor a political party over the popular will of its citizens. Just ask Wisconsin.
