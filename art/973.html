“you’ve been given a second chance.”

My advice to you, Dr. Jones, would be to seek help for your condition as soon as possible. While I respect your candor in this meeting, it is clear that you are not treating this condition seriously, and the people in my industry will hold your comments against you. In other words, you need help to ensure that these comments are not just a one-off.

Please accept my best wishes for a speedy recovery. If I can be of further assistance, please call me. You may be surprised at how responsive I am.

I appreciate your time.

Regards,

Mark

Subject: GAS DELIVERIES TO BG&E


One of the stipulations in our tolling agreement is that it is a physical
contract.  This means that you need to send a paper signed copy with the
actual paper signature of BG&E.  This can be faxed to 781-270-0055 or you
can mail it to me.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.


Thanks,
