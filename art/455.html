Otherwise the documents are approved.

Chuck-

 I appreciate the careful review.  My initial comments are as follows:

1.    At the end of Section 2, I think that we need to add the following:

"Each of Floating Storage and Balancing will be hereinafter referred to as 
the "Service".  If Floating Storage and Balancing are provided by different 
entities, they will be separately invoiced. "

2.    In Section 3, is it possible to delete the part that reads: 

"For avoidance of doubt, the monthly storage fee will be $.04 per Dth"

and 

"For avoidance of doubt, the transmission usage fee will be $.02 per Dth."

and just add: 

"The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the 
Product description on the Website. "


3.    In the fifth line of the second paragraph, add "which Company may 
assign without notice for failure to make payments when due."

4.    In the sixteenth line of the first paragraph, replace "are permitted" 
with "are intended to allow".

5.    Delete third line of the second full paragraph (through the word 
"including"). 

6.    In the fourteenth line of the second paragraph, I think we need to add 
"and Company."

7.    In the seventeenth line, change "its" to "they". 

8.    In the third line of the eighth paragraph, delete the word "use".

9.    In the second line of the eleventh paragraph, add "is" before the word 
"provided".

10.   In the third line of the thirteenth paragraph, change "it's" to "their".

11.   In the twelfth line of the fifteenth paragraph, delete the word "and" 
and add "use" before the word "it's".

12.   I am not sure the in the fifteenth line of the nineteenth paragraph 
delete the words "it's or may be used" and replace it with "it's".  Otherwise 
the text is approved.

13.   In the seventeenth line of the twentieth paragraph, delete the word 
"whether" and add "whether".

14.   In the twelfth line of the twenty-first paragraph, delete the words 
"if" and "as".

15.   In the fourth line of the thirteenth full paragraph, delete the words 
"in relation to" and add "that is". 

16.   At the end of the first full paragraph on the twenty-second page, 
change "use of the Website or Services by Customer or Customer's Authorised 
Users" to "use of the Website or Service by Customer or Customer's Authorized 
Users" so that the sentence reads "By using the Website or the Services, 
Customer agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  
Customer agrees that it is solely Customer's responsibility to obtain access 
to the services provided by Floating Storage and Balancing and that Customer 
is solely responsible for paying any and all fees associated with such 
access."


Please call me at your earliest convenience at (713)853-6895 to discuss 
further. 

Thanks

Subject:  Transmission Customer Agreement


Clint,
     I was recently approached by Transmission Connection, Inc. regarding
the possibility of Enron becoming a "Market Maker".   As part of any Market
Maker Agreement, Enron would have to agree to certain terms as a condition
to becoming a Market Maker.   Attached is a draft version of a proposed
contract that Transmission Connection is willing to submit to Enron.  If
you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to call me at (713)
853-6895.  I can also be reached via email.  I will leave town this evening
until Thursday, but will check voice mail messages and e-mail while I am
gone.

Thanks,

Chuck Randall
