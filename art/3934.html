A few small issues marred a good bout.

As I said previously, CM Punk was back on the mic and in that capacity, he was very entertaining. While working with Jerry Lawler, he used some interesting words to sell his points, which was a nice departure from his monotonous monotone of the last few weeks. We also had a couple of fun interactions with the announce team, namely Michael Cole and Booker T, with Cole saying that no one is worried about CM Punk and Booker being his backup and not caring one bit.

The next match, which was a rematch from the previous week’s Raw, saw Sin Cara try to defend the IC Title. He picked up a win over Daniel Bryan, but we also had a segment where Dolph Ziggler and Layla showed up to the show. As I said last week, I don’t understand the logic behind the heel turn of Layla, but at least we’re seeing some interesting heel teams now, such as Dolph Ziggler and AJ Lee, Dolph Ziggler and Layla and Dolph Ziggler and Kaitlyn.

Another match on the card was a special announcement for an upcoming WWE DVD set of all of the WWE Hall of Fame inductees for the past year. I have always loved watching these sets, so this was a very exciting moment to see the list released for the first time.

The main event was another match that was hyped for weeks as a PPV worthy match, though the show was a bit low on match quality overall. While the match did end in a very clean DQ after Jack Swagger got involved, it wasn’t the cleanest of matches. While I don’t think I would complain about this match being on a PPV or a TV show in general, it felt a little flat. The buildup to the finish was well done, though.

The main event was a match that I thought would be really interesting, but ultimately it didn’t reach the level that it should have. Part of it is the whole being in a steel cage scenario. There are some obvious issues there and I don’t think we will see this match used again, so that was a bit of a shame. All in all, a low quality main event meant that this was a bit of a letdown, as an overall show, but it was still better than last week’s RAW.

Next week’s show will feature a special guest appearance by Stone Cold Steve Austin and a show called Stacked.

I think my wrestling enjoyment has been on a consistent decline since TNA arrived. In this time there have been many factors, from the changes in wrestling presentation with the rise of the WWE Network to the influx of young talent that TNA signed without a plan for building their characters. They just signed a bunch of young guys with interesting ring styles and told them to do what they do best. Most of those guys don’t really have much character development at all, or if they do they do it very very quickly. We all know people were excited when TNA debuted The Main Event Mafia but look what happened to those guys now! I’ve even seen some TNA stars tweet about how they can’t keep up with the new WWE talents, and its pretty scary how bad the situation has gotten over the past year or two.

So that is why I really loved seeing TNA work with a much more polished company like Japan. I know it might seem like a minor thing, but it made TNA seem more professional in their presentation. I don’t know if this was the first time that TNA has been done like this, but seeing some of the matches and how they look overall made me feel like TNA has a real chance to make a comeback. Sure they may be years behind WWE in this time, but I think as wrestling fans we need to accept that this is just the way things are now. Every wrestling promotion has its own style and its own presentation. With the WWE Network, the way wrestling is now will become the way everything is, as WWE wrestlers will be able to appear on Raw in Japan and they will be much more polished due to their experience with the WWE Network. It will really just be a small difference at first but WWE will have total control over their product. They really control the biggest aspect of it by streaming it online and selling it to anyone in the world, but WWE has the TV contract that allows them to control wrestling in America. That is what’s important. Any TV rights deal in America is all the promotion needs to take the lead as far as wrestling is concerned. Just ask TNA.

So please do us wrestling fans a favor and try to enjoy wrestling again. Go back and check out some old TNA DVDs and really remember what wrestling is like, what is should be like, and try to remember what all the excitement is about. Maybe we can at least start a movement to get some of the older guys to get more involved with wrestling instead of getting paid to do other things and then only showing up when there is a WWE pay day or something.

You see, my friend, there was a time in wrestling when a kid like the kid you are couldn’t be told when to go to bed because the show must go on. That was the way wrestling was built and that is the way the business was run. The thing is, that is changing. The WWE is getting more and more powerful and they are starting to rule wrestling, both on their own product and to a lesser extent on other wrestling companies. The WWE is basically the only company</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:44
