"It's all right." "I've already met our mystery man." "His name is Walter Lassiter, and I'm sure he's a perfectly lovely human being." "But you, on the other hand, are a two-faced, back-biting hussy." "And I'm never gonna talk to you again." "What are you doing here?" "Aren't you supposed to be in jail?" "Yeah, I am." "But lucky for me, a well-connected citizen bailed me out." " So why did you bail me out?" " I figured it was the right thing to do." "You know, I guess some people are worth saving." "And it turns out you're one of them." "Thank you." "Oh, please." "Walter, I've been really busy this afternoon, so if you don't mind..." "Oh, actually I do mind." "I'd like to know why you bailed me out." "Okay, this isn't easy." "I'm really happy, and I don't want to mess it up." "Okay, you know what, Walter?" "I'm just not buying it." "This is some kind of a trick." " No, no." " You just said that you've been happy, but, that you didn't know what you were missing." "Look, I..." "Look, you're a big part of my life now." "You know, you're the only person that I can count on, and..." "You're the only person that I can lean on." "That's..." "That's really nice to hear." "Thank you." "Then why don't we celebrate that with a nice hot bubble bath?" "Let's do it." "A bubble bath?" "What do you say?" "Excuse me, may I interrupt?" "I need some help with the caterers." "Would you mind stepping out?" "Actually, I'm in the middle of something." "Sorry, just one minute." "May I help you?" "Yeah." "I've come to see Mr. Lassiter." "I'm sorry, you're not on the list." "And unless you have an appointment, I'm gonna have to ask you..." "Look, pal, I understand that the help wants to stick it to the man, but this is kind of embarrassing." "Do you know who I am?" "I do, and I'd love to help you, Mr. Lassiter." "But the thing is" "I just came from my honeymoon, and my bride won't take a bath unless I'm in there with her." "It's a very traditional thing in our culture." "I'd be happy to wait outside." "No, no, no." "This is a matter of pride for me." "If you see me take a bath, you can report back to the mailroom that I was very polite." "Mr. Lassiter," "I don't know if you're just being a gentleman, but if it will make you feel better," "I promise you, you can go first." "Thank you." "Oh, that's much better." "My pleasure." "I can't believe that little blonde-headed girl let you in." "I guess I have her to thank for this." "Walter, what is going on?" "What are you doing?" "I'm taking a bath." "Well, what were you doing before?" "Washing your filthy feet?" "I happen to be an extremely clean man." "You weren't doing that?" "No, you said we couldn't do it, so I stopped." "But you couldn't stop, could you?" "How was it?" "It felt good." "You wanna give it a go?" "I'll bet you do." " You have no idea." " Walter." "I thought I heard somebody calling my name." "Walter, what were you doing in there?" "Why are you following me?" "Well, it's just..." "I was worried." "It seemed like you were overdoing it a little." "Hey, I'll decide how much is too much." "I know you don't believe me, but I was going for a bath." "Oh, well, that's a relief." "You know, I guess I don't really blame you." "You must feel you really are stuck with a basket case." "Well, if it's any consolation," "I think you're doing a terrific job with these kids." " That's why I wanna get back." " Yeah." "Good luck with that." "Oh, that was amazing." "What?" "The way you just let me talk." "I guess that's why you're Walter Lassiter." "Hey, Walter, you ready for a little kick in the pants?" "That's okay." "I don't want to hear it." "I don't wanna see it." "I'm doing it." "You're doing it." "Look out, Lassie." "What you up to, little lady?" "You in on this together?" "Yeah, we're in on it together." "I can tell you that he doesn't have a history of doing this." "Hey, do you have a history of not taking baths?" " Walter, just let it go." " No, I'm gonna tell him." " Hey, my man." " I'm gonna tell him." " Walter, it was a joke." " Yeah, right." "You know, the only joke around here is you." "Hey, I see the kids are wearing their stupid buttons again." "Yeah, the school thinks you're pretty cute too." "That's why I thought you'd be really proud of them for doing that." "Yeah, well, they..." "They won't be wearing those for long." "All right, why don't you have a seat?" "I want to talk to you about the kids' fundraiser on Saturday night." "Hey, I don't wanna talk about it." "That's why I brought you here." "You know, I gotta be honest with you." "I've got more important things to do on Saturday than listen to you talk about your fundraiser." "Why, are you forgetting?" "I'm making my presentation on Saturday night." " No, I don't think so." " Why, sure you are." "I wrote it on the card you gave me." "What time?" "What card?" "I don't have any card." "I didn't make one for you because I didn't think we were gonna have to come and get you out of jail." "Hey, how could you do that?" "Do what?" "When you got a real hostage, you don't have to look for a card." "You write on your wrist." "So this is what's been going on?" "What happened to our lunch date?" "Why did you bail me out like that?" "Because I thought you needed help." "Yeah, but not that kind." "Not that kind?" "Okay, what kind of help did you think I needed?" "Oh, all right, Walter." "I figured you could use some good old-fashioned male advice." "So I fixed you up with the one woman who wouldn't let you out of the house with dirty feet." "You're blaming this on me?" "I'm just a woman in love." "So if anything went wrong, it's not my fault." "You're telling me it's hers." "Walter, why are you taking her side?" "I'm not taking her side." "I'm just trying to explain." " Hey, if she needs help..." " No, don't give me that stuff." "If she needs help, she can ask." "Don't you think I'm mad enough already?" "Oh, God, if this is how she treats you when you're not an idiot, imagine what she's gonna do when she finds out you're in jail." "Okay, I'll do it." "What?" "I said I'll do it." "Thanks." "Really?" "That's great." "I'm really excited about the presentation I'm gonna give on Saturday night." "It's really a chance to bring all the kids together." "And now you've really got me excited about it." "Well, that's nice to hear." "Thanks." "Well, I'm gonna go now." "But I'll see you Saturday night?" "Well, what's Saturday night?" "Hey, how come you're not at that fancy new club?" "Well, Lydia had to cancel our reservations." "Yeah, but I never got there." "Oh, that's probably because I wanted you here." "What do you mean you wanted me here?" "Well, don't you remember?" "You and I talked about it a couple of times and then we got interrupted and never finished our conversation." "Well, the kids are down there on their way out for the night." "You know, I promised we'd go down there and pick them up." "I know." "Well, come on." "We'll go pick them up." "Okay, I'll go get my coat." "Where's your coat?" "Where's your coat?" "Where's your coat?" "Right there." "Now take off your scarf." "Take off your scarf?" "Why?" "We're going to pick up the kids." "No, no." "Walter, I can't go out in public with you without my scarf." "Nobody will recognize</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:47
