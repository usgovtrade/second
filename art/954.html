you run into a problem, 
there's a sense of a 
solution, and there's a 
way of doing the solution 
that you can just move on 
and work on something else. 
And so a person may spend 
30 minutes of their day 
thinking about a problem, 
and they write a 10 page 
email, and they're working 
on the problem until lunch 
or dinner, and then they 
maybe write two more pages, 
or maybe they don't get 
it, and so they start 
working on something else, 
but that's just part of the 
process. 
And so as I said, 
productivity in software 
engineering is very high 
when people are in the zone. 
And there's a feeling that 
this is hard, but once you 
get it, it's a very valuable 
skill that you can have. 
The issue is, how do you get 
into the zone? 
And how do you get out of 
the zone? 
So this is where we talk 
about time, and specifically 
managing time. 
You know, time is probably 
the most valuable resource 
you have. 
And again, it's a really 
common thing that it takes a 
few seconds to recognize 
when your mind is in the 
zone, and the rest of the 
time, you're probably 
bothering, so it's the 
amount of time it takes you 
to start doing something, 
and the amount of time it 
takes you to start coding. 
And there's a lot of things 
to talk about that, but I 
want to give you one example 
of a way that we can measure 
this. 
And this is a talk that a 
good friend of mine gave 
named Dan O'Hara at PyCon. 
If you've never seen it, he 
wrote this talk, and he got 
an A+, but he got a huge 
round of applause at the end 
for this. 
And what it's about is this 
problem called the Lobster 
problem, and it was given by 
an economist by the name of 
James Hamilton. 
It's just, in a nutshell, 
take a lobster, throw it in 
boiling water, let it boil 
for five minutes, and then 
take out the meat. 
But the trick is, do you 
want to kill the lobster by 
putting it in boiling water? 
Or do you just want to kill 
it by boiling it for 5 
minutes? 
But the whole question is, 
if you just boiled it for 5 
minutes, you know what would 
happen? 
The lobster would stay alive 
just the same. 
But it wouldn't be cooked at 
all. 
And do you want to kill the 
lobster or not? 
And so the question that's 
embedded in the name of this 
thing is if you want to make 
it cooked, is it okay to boil 
it for 5 minutes, or should 
you put it in hot water and 
boil it for 5 minutes? 
And the question is actually 
a little bit subtle, but 
understanding that, as an 
engineer, how we look at this 
is this, there are these two 
variables, the amount of time 
it takes to cook it, the time 
it takes to cook it. 
And then there's some 
constraint, in this case, 
there's a constraint that 
says, this variable has to be 
greater than this variable. 
The question is, what does 
the answer to the question 
really depend on? 
What's the effect on that 
time, so the time it takes to 
cook it, and the amount of 
time it takes to cook it, 
what's the effect of that? 
And what you can do is take 
the time that you boil it for 
5 minutes, and then take the 
amount of time it takes to 
cook it. 
And so the question is, what 
happens if you were to boil 
it for, for a given value of 
N, so say for N equals 5, 
boil it for 5 minutes, if you 
didn't change anything. 
And so what you're seeing is 
this interesting curve of 
some sort of function. 
And you can see that, the 
relationship here is time to 
cook, and this is the amount 
of time you boil it for, N. 
But the question is, if I 
find the value that maximizes 
this, I'm going to get a value 
that has, has, the number is 
growing, the difference 
between the two time. 
The time that it takes to 
boil it, and the time that it 
takes to cook it. 
And this is basically 
equivalent to that. 
So what's the question? 
In order to find the right 
number, you're really looking 
at this as the question, in 
order to cook it the best, 
how much time do I need to 
boil it? 
Now, I don't mean to say, 
after you boil it, how much 
time you have to cook it. 
The question is, how much 
time you need to boil it? 
And in order to boil it, you 
need to let it heat up first. 
And so this is actually a 
really important point. 
And what you find in order 
find this is a lot of times, 
this, this value is going to 
be a piecewise function, like 
this. 
Because it's different ways 
to cook something, what 
matters here, is the amount 
of time that it takes to boil 
it. 
It's not about cooking it. 
It's not like it needs to be 
something cooking it, it just 
needs to be boiling it. 
And you start to say, in 
order to boil it, I need this 
amount of time, and this 
amount of time. 
And so the amount of time you 
need to boil it is a lot more 
important than how much time 
it takes you to cook it. 
And if this is true, if this 
function is a piecewise 
function, it's not a linear 
function, which means it 
doesn't have a piecewise 
function of some sort, and you 
just see some smooth function. 
And it's not hard to see 
where this is the case. 
Because the number of things 
that you can boil in, let's 
say, boiling water is 
relatively high. 
You can boil pots of water, 
you can boil pans of water, 
you can boil pans of water. 
And so that this would be a 
more efficient way to boil 
water. 
But let's say you're cooking 
something, and let's say you 
have this as your time. 
So that's a total of N plus 
the time it takes to boil it, 
and so that's the limit of how 
fast you can boil it. 
And so you see, if this was 
constant, you couldn't boil 
anything. 
But if this was a number that 
got bigger, then it would get 
faster to boil things. 
And so, in the limit, it 
doesn't, in the limit you 
don't have to cook it. 
And so the question is, it's 
not a linear function, it's a 
piecewise function. 
And so the only way that 
really the constraint is 
linear is if the amount of 
time it takes you to boil it 
is completely independent of 
how long you cook it. 
And if the amount of time it 
takes you to boil it was 
completely independent of how 
long you cook it, then it 
would be a linear function. 
And so that's not the case, 
so the constraint function is 
a piecewise function, and so 
that's the thing that you can 
see, that if you have a piece 
wise function, you're not 
going to get the function 
completely for free. 
And so in order to get the 
best bang for the buck, we 
have to take the lowest 
amount of time to boil, to 
pick the biggest value, and 
so that's, if you do, this</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:15
