In addition, the report is chock-full of examples of "fake news" from various media outlets that could have been interpreted by a casual reader as actual news.

And this doesn't even get into the Trump transition team's many blunders and embarrassments, such as the time it had to correct the fact that its list of its own members was missing a couple of names.

So what should you do? First, keep in mind that this is just a collection of headlines about this report that, like all those headlines, presents a misleading picture. Second, you should not let people's emotions get the best of them. The report doesn't "prove" that Russia influenced the election, or that Trump is beholden to Russia, or that his campaign colluded with Russia. Those are the same "fake news" stories you may have read from other outlets. If you don't believe me, do the research! Here are some good resources:

The report itself, prepared by former FBI Director James Comey and his investigators (you can see a sample on page 45 here)

The Intelligence Committee's report (pdf, 5 MB)

And if you're more of a casual political observer, perhaps keep an eye on the following news agencies. There are currently no credible reports of any wrongdoing, but who knows what the future will bring?
