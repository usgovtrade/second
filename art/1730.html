Gualtieri, whose pride, now turned to indignation, was beyond his
control. "No, sir, you are mistaken, my dear count. It is not
_Fernand_, it is himself who is here."

"Zounds! are you mad?" cried the nobleman, turning pale.

"As you know best, my lord," answered Gualtieri.

"Tell me, by heaven!" cried the other, turning from him in fury, and
speaking to the duke. "Are you not aware of it?"

"It is true. I saw it myself; and the fact that Fernand has been
absent some time from the citadel does not surprise me."

"Oh! oh! oh!" cried the old nobleman, foaming at the mouth, and
stamping with rage; "all this was premeditated--it is a treachery!
But the impudence of the fellow! I expected to meet him at the
church; he has dared to dare! It is not credible. Why, he thought me
dead! Yes, yes--there is a secret understanding between these two,
that they are to marry. What a disgrace!"

"Who, Count Gualtieri?" asked the duke, anxiously.

"I think so. They were closeted together for an hour last night, and
they met again to-day--this morning."

"My lord," said the duke, "I can give you good proofs of their
intercourse. But if you will be satisfied, I will go and ask him to
return, as I was sure he was coming."

"No, you shall not! I do not want any proof! You can see for
yourself that your daughter has gone off with that scoundrel!"

"She did not go off with him," replied the duke; "she was taken
off."

"Well, what then? She has gone off, and she will have to be brought
back. I will have her married to my son."

"It is to be feared that you will find the father also missing,"
answered the duke, with a bitter laugh.

"Well, then, we will get some other priest to marry them," said the
nobleman, "even if we have to go a hundred leagues."

The duke understood his meaning, and gave a shudder.

"We can do nothing until after the coronation, which, as you know,
is fixed for next week."

"Coronation, indeed! What do you mean?"

"The coronation of Louis VIII., King of France."

"Ah!" exclaimed the nobleman. "Of whom, in heaven's name?"

"Of Louis VIII., King of France."

"Are you quite mad, my lord?"

"I have just left the king, and you were there."

"I know I was there, my lord," he said, in a tone of reproach. "And
I have come back to tell you that there is some mistake--some
mistake."

The duke looked at him in amazement.

"Come to your senses!" he cried. "It is no use putting on the airs
of an emperor, my lord; you ought to be aware that we are in a
dilemma--we must have a crown, or there is no coronation. There
could be no better time than this, when the throne of Naples is in
danger."

"But it is not my throne that is threatened."

"I know," replied the duke; "but Louis wishes to be crowned, and I
tell you that he will have to be, to get the crown of Naples."

"Then," said the old nobleman, bitterly, "I suppose he will have to
give me the duchy, for he certainly will not give it to a mere
adventurer like my son."

"Nor can I blame him, my lord," said the duke, with a grave look.

"I do not doubt it," he replied. "He knows well that I am his
friend. And so, then, is it necessary that my son should marry the
king's sister? I would not consent to that myself."

"Well, my lord, the time will come when you will see that this was
for the best."

"I say so! Well, I will not be beaten, and do not think I will allow
this marriage to take place. I will go straight to Monaco and make a
scene with the king about it."

"He would throw you into a dungeon, and have you brought here
afterwards to be murdered," replied the duke.

"So be it," said the count, impatiently. "I shall at least find out
what is going on."

And he left the room.

"The fellow," said Gualtieri, "will get me the most dangerous
revenge, for if I am not mistaken, he will tell the king that I
know, and that my opposition will prevent his marriage. He will
force me to put him into confinement, and perhaps even kill him. In
one sense this is very just, but it is a very dangerous course to
pursue. I shall be ruined, for by such a scandal in the royal family
my credit at court will be destroyed, and my enemies will crush me.
But I must do it."

He went up to the duke, and spoke to him very seriously.

"Your highness," he said, "you have done me a great injury, for
which I shall be always under your debt, but I will revenge myself.
When the king visits us in my castle, as he intended to do, I will
give you time to escape, and you must go--and go alone; if you meet
the king, you will kill him. I do not know whether or not the
marriage will take place, for I have taken no steps to prevent it;
but if the king does not come, and if I should happen to hear that
the old nobleman has escaped from the castle and gone to Monaco, I
will know how to set the matter right. But let us not think of this;
you must be ready when the time comes."

"But your highness," said the duke, with some hesitation, "will not
your nephew go?"

"If he does he shall follow in the train of the king. Be sure that
all are well guarded, and tell them that I must see the king alone."

"But if he is not so well guarded?"

"Then I will myself go and see him."

"But this young girl, who is a prisoner, and--"

"You do not suppose," cried the duke, angrily, "that a mere girl
would be able to escape from a fortress guarded by my soldiers?
Besides, she is perfectly happy here, and has nothing to wish for.
Besides, what has become of all her friends?"

"I do not know, my lord," replied the duke, "whether the king would
return with you to your castle?"

"The king will return in such a way that no one shall know where he
has been."

"How?"

"I do not know; but rest assured that he will return. It is the only
thing that can be done for us."

And Gualtieri left the room to make his preparations.




CHAPTER XVII

THE QUEEN'S GRIEVANCE


The moment which the duke had been awaiting so impatiently had come.
The king arrived with all his suite, and was received by the two
dukes in the principal apartment, the most elegant in the castle,
with high carved work of rare marbles, arabesques, and a richly
gilded cornice. In the centre of this room stood an elegant bed of
solid oak, with hangings of rich crimson silk; and in a niche above
it the bust of a hero, by Dosso Dossi, which the nobleman who had
been so rudely interrupted in his amorous dalliance had the
ingenuity to set up there. Two large candelabra, that shed a blaze
of light, and cast a dazzling glare on the richly gilded cornices,
ornaments, and ornaments of the most elegant designs, as well as on
the hangings that were richly embroidered, gave an almost Oriental
splendor to the room, which was adorned with many gold-flowered
stools, tabourets, and arm-chairs; among these the king seemed
impatient to take his place, for he could not refrain from casting a
hasty glance around him. He threw himself on a seat, and desired his
captains to take their places around him, two by two, in the way he
had determined to travel.

The two dukes saluted him respectfully, and went out to meet the
queen, who entered in full state. The whole train of knights and
ladies followed, and the procession passed into the antechamber.
