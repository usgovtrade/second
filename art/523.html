I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things. Now come back to the other side."

"I can't, Albie. He wants me to go back to his house and have dinner 
with him." 

"Well, that's simple enough," answered Albie, stepping out of the boat 
to help her. "But wait a minute. Now see me first. Then come back and 
help her. Just keep to the other side of the boat. Don't get in 
anywhere near where I'm standing." 

"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy or something?" asked Chris. 

"No," said Albie, grinning wickedly. "I am more than safe. Look over 
my shoulder." 

"Well, why don't you let him come to your house?" queried Chris. 

"It's all arranged. He's waiting for you there." 

"Albie, he has some strange ideas. But all right, I'll go. Now," she 
said to me, "you see me go down this side. Then you come back and help 
Albie. You'll be behind me, so he won't see you. Got it?" 

"Yes," I said. "I will be in that nook over there. Don't worry." 

"I just wish I knew what was in his mind," she thought, as she took a 
step toward the bow of the canoe, followed by Albie. 

I was standing where they could not see me. I was very curious to know 
what was going on. I could not understand what Albie was up to, but 
wanted to keep close by him, just in case he needed me. 

Just before she was out of sight, I heard Albie say: "Now, if you'll be 
good enough to wait here. I'll go over to the house and get my suit 
and come back, and I won't be long. But I don't want any of the 
others to go near the shore. It would spoil everything if one of them 
should get into the house. See?"

"How many rooms is this house?" queried Chris, in a whisper. 

"One large one and a smaller one. There's a large veranda outside. A 
couple of smaller ones. And the dining-room, of course." 

"How many windows?" I heard Albie ask. 

"I guess there is about a hundred or so," Chris answered. 

"And there are a lot of doors, I suppose," Albie thought aloud. 

"Fifty-one of them." 

"You know, Chris, it might be a good idea to put on some extra suits. 
That way we could hide easily enough. There are plenty of nooks where 
one could hide," said Albie, in a rather off-hand sort of voice. 

"No. It's a good deal nicer this way," Chris answered. "Nobody will 
get in here. The other children can't get a chance. We won't be 
bothered so much. It will be nicer here. And we need only one room. 
Well," she thought, aloud, "I will go up to the house now. You be sure 
to come back. And remember not a single thing, not one of us. And the 
room is upstairs, and I have the key." 

"Where did you put the key to the other door?" 

"Up there in my bureau," answered Chris. "It is always put up there 
when I lock it. I use it sometimes to lock the door of one of the 
smaller rooms. I will have to go and get it now, I suppose." 

"Not just yet. But listen. If any one happens to go out of the other 
door, don't you go in any other direction than that." 

"I won't," said Chris, confidently. 

"Don't you go anywhere, not out of this boat, that is. It might be 
well if you could manage to stay here, too. But just stay near Albie, 
all the time. We don't want anybody to see you." 

"Who is he?" asked Chris, thoughtfully. 

"He is a friend of mine. We have been up to the house before, you and 
I." 

"Oh," said Chris. "Then I don't care so much about him. But where do 
you suppose he has gone?" 

"I'll find out in a minute. And now remember, don't go out of the boat 
until I come back. Wait here in the nook. I'll be right back in a 
minute." 

"All right," said Chris, thoughtfully. 

Albie returned to his post. Chris was waiting for him in the bow of 
the canoe. She was standing very close to the stern, out of the sight 
of anybody on shore. Albie picked up the oars. 

"There's a ladder," I heard her say. "You can go right up to the veranda 
and come to me from there. You will be safe there, I guess. Now then, 
you are to wait for me inside, aren't you?" she asked. 

"Yes," answered Albie, in a voice which betrayed his nervousness. 

"All right. I'll go up first. You just wait outside for me." 

"I'll do." 

I heard Chris walk around the veranda and begin to ascend the steps 
toward the front door. And at the same time Albie was paddling the 
canoe through the shallow water, in the same direction. 

"She's coming," said Albie. "I must be close now." 

Then I saw his paddle go out of the water, to make a little landing on 
the shore. But he was too late. There was a loud splash, and Albie was 
knocked sprawling. 

I was on my feet, running down the beach. Just as Albie was picking 
himself up, I had grabbed him by the arm and flung him flat in the 
bottom of the canoe. He was more startled than hurt, but I could have 
killed him if I had wanted to. 

"What do you mean, spying on me?" I hissed at him. "I'm going to teach 
you better than that." 

Then I looked up. There was a light in the veranda, showing plainly on 
the steps. Chris was coming up the walk. And on the step, looking as 
if she had been sleeping on it, I saw Chris's key. 

I picked it up and looked at it, holding it in my hand. But I did not 
need it. Albie was not to be fooled by it now. I only hoped it would 
open the door. 

"That key was stolen," I said to Albie, quietly, taking no notice of 
Chris at all. "Take it with you. Don't bring it back." 

Albie looked as if he was ready to drop on the spot. He was white, and 
his eyes glared at me, like those of a wild animal. And for some 
reason I got the impression that he had been drinking. There was a 
horrible glint in his eyes. He seemed to be glaring through his 
spectacles. 

"I told you not to come here!" he snarled. "You've spoiled everything." 

"What have I to do with it?" I demanded. 

"You heard what I said. The whole thing is my doing. I knew about the 
other key. I knew she had been here. She had a chance to hide it 
herself. And you've spoiled the whole thing, both for you and for me. 
I will tell you a secret. I don't want to be the leader any more. 
That's why I came here. There, I'm going now. Go back where you came 
from." 

"You stay here," I said. "I want to find out a few things first." 

"I won't stay here and be jailed for you, if I don't want to," said 
Albie. 

"Very well," I said. "I'll just follow you around in the canoe. We 
don't want any more surprises, do we? And don't let anything happen to 
Chris. I want her to come home with me." 

"Why do you say that?" asked Albie. 

"It's important," I answered. "And I'm not joking. If you come near 
her, I'll take you in the canoe." 

"Oh, all right. But you've got to stay in the boat. The man might see 
you." 

"Very well. Let us go," I said. 

Albie did not speak. He looked at me for a moment, then got in the 
canoe and lay down on the bottom. 

"What did you do, Albie?" I asked. "</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:40
