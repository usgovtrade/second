If
you’ve got a lot on your plate right now and your kids are acting out a lot or
you just want to get on a good track with the kids in a hurry, you might want
to read this, “Coach Moments” that will certainly make you laugh and think.

Sometimes we don’t see our own faults as being mistakes. As
much as you want to be a great coach to your kids, the reality is that some of
the best lessons come from the mistakes.

When You Can’t See Your Own Faults

When
we don’t see our own faults, we find it really easy to blame others for the way
our lives go and for the struggles that come. It’s easy to say that someone else’s
faults are to blame for the way our life is going and for why our family is a
mess right now. But, I mean, we are all aware that
the Bible tells us that it is the parent’s fault if their children turn out
the way that they do and we all know that they have to be the ones to really
show love, help and care for their kids. This isn’t a perfect world; it’s
harder for a lot of people out there than we’d like to admit. It takes love,
compassion and love to raise children. Parents know that. That doesn’t make
it any easier.

But,
sometimes, when we can’t really see our own faults it can be really hard to
admit that we need some help. Our kids, at times, can turn us into a raging
tiger who does not care about their behavior or their attitude. We need to
recognize that there are times when our behaviors towards our kids aren’t
working. If it has been a while since you’ve been in a “Coach Moments” sort of
a mood, you might be surprised to know that there are other moms out there who
have had to face and learn from these life lessons and more often than not, it
takes a few bumps and bruises to really get it.

Recognize That
Even the Best of Moms Might Fail or Mistake in the Right Way

It’s
easy to think that only “bad” moms make those mistakes and have those “Coach
Moments”. But, really? Do you think that’s true? I don’t. I think you’re
really underestimating the bad moms out there. Maybe you think that all the
“bad” moms are on drugs and getting DUI and stuff. But, I don’t think that’s
true. I just think that those moms were going through a lot of issues and were
just having a bad day and that’s all. I don’t think it makes them “bad” moms
after all. You know, these are the times when they don’t show their kids what
a great parent they are, those are the times that show people that they aren’t
the best mother in the world but that they want to be. It’s hard for any parent
to admit they’re not doing their job when it comes to their child’s well being.
And it takes someone that is honest with themselves to admit that they need
help.

“Coach Moments”
Is Something That’s a Real Test for You and Your Kids

When
it comes to things like kids misbehaving and fighting and saying horrible things
to other people and getting involved in drama that isn’t yours, things can get
really ugly really fast. These “Coach Moments” can
also be quite challenging for other people to see. I
mean, we all know that it isn’t easy. As hard as it is for us to see our own
faults, it’s hard for other people to see them as well. But, it’s important
that we make an effort.

The
best thing to do when it comes to coaching moments is to be honest and to teach
your kids that, even if you are their coach, you are only human and not perfect.
Just like everyone, you will make mistakes, but sometimes our kids need a mom
or dad that says, “I messed up” or “I blew it” or even “I failed”. And to help
teach our kids not to make the same mistakes that we make, there are times
when we have to help ourselves get up and try again. And those times that are
the most difficult are the ones where our kids might even try to make us feel
bad and try to make us feel like we are a bad mom or dad. It’s tough for any
person to show the “bad” moments, but this can help us learn and grow.

Learning, growing and growing up. It’s all part of life, isn’t
it?

Just be careful with the mom or dad jokes around that time because your kids will take them all the more seriously. It doesn’t
just happen with the little ones. If your kids are still in elementary school
and high school, there is a good chance that they are quite mature. They know a
lot about life and themselves so be careful with those jokes around then as
well.

About
Dee-Ann Travis:

Dee-Ann Travis has been
living in the United States for almost 30 years and has lived in Texas since
she was nine years old. She grew up in a small Texas town and loves the small
town lifestyle. She’s a writer, a blogger, a poet, and a mom of two wonderful
children. She’s also someone who knows a little bit about “Coach Moments.”

You’ll find Dee-Ann over at her blog, Mommy on Purpose and her poetry can be found at Heart Full of Fire Poetry as well.

One of my favorite reads: “I remember getting down on my knees and begging him to change his mind, but he only laughed and told me to get the f—— out of his apartment. I got no help, and he would give me nothing except cold, harsh rejection, and I was powerless to stop him. What kind of relationship did this child want with me?”

What a lovely story, Dee-Ann. It’s so easy to blame someone else for the way our lives go and the struggles that come.

We are all responsible for our own lives, for our own happiness. It’s only when we take responsibility that we can really learn to live in alignment with our own truth. Your willingness to look at the issue of your life and the role you are playing in the drama is really wonderful and refreshing.

I can also completely relate to this idea of accepting responsibility for the way things are. I like to blame myself for all the things that happen and my actions on any given day can completely determine my experience of my day. This is a very important point you make; it’s not just that we can blame other people for the way things go but it’s also our responsibility to work towards creating what we desire and what we can create starts with self.

It takes great strength to take the time and to look at the root of any one issue or situation in your life. You are really on to something with the idea of being honest with yourself and of taking responsibility for every issue that arises and the solution to it. Thanks so much for sharing. I’m sure the reader will find it helpful.

Thank you, Nisha, for the really thoughtful, kind words you have shared. That is my goal with my writing – to be honest with people and to share from my heart. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you.

Thanks for sharing your story! You have a wonderfully honest piece. While I completely agree with you that the mistakes we make, especially those made when we are young, are not only a part of who we are but also define who we become, we can’t learn to forgive and move past them if we don’t acknowledge them as mistakes.

That’s a tough but beautiful picture of a mom trying to help her kids become independent. No wonder they say “motherhood is tough”..and I love the idea of learning to forgive them as mistakes.

Yes, I think there are many moms who were not being good parents when their kids were younger. We might think about them a little bit differently when they are</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:38
