How often do you actually have an out of the ordinary experience in a church service? I think it happens about as often as we make an out of the ordinary experience happen. Mostly, we talk about ordinary experiences.

So, on a recent Sunday, I heard the preacher say “I want to talk about something we don’t talk about much – that God really does scare us!”

I can’t remember how long it had been since I had done anything out of the ordinary in a church service, so I was actually a little bit amazed and a little bit scared. It was a good moment. I’m actually glad it was said.

Do you know how many people experience something out of the ordinary in a church service? Do you know what would happen if we all started experiencing something more often than out of the ordinary? In my opinion, there is something great on the other side of the unknown we experience when we experience something extraordinary.

In fact, in one of my favorite Bible stories, when the people see the great flood, they begin to doubt. They even started to build a ship because they wanted to know where they were going. So, God sent a wind and the water starts to rise, and they take to the ship. Then the wind stops, and they jump in the water to escape!

When God is not in the boat with them, they have no idea what to do. When they are in the middle of the flood, there is no one to protect them or to help them. They can’t see God at all! When the storm begins to move on, they have no clue as to where it is going. When they turn around to get back, they are just as lost as they were before!

How often do we do the same thing? We keep an eye out for the next challenge or we figure out how we might be able to improve the way things are.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:23
