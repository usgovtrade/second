Check out my ride of the day -
this bad to the bone, this is my number one 
ride.
(funky bass guitar)
The 
trucker parked it next to a curb and put a
truckers cap
on him. The man was dressed like a 
street cleaner,
he's holding a leaf blower and he's 
sucking
and blowing and sucking and blowing on 
this leaf blower, and I thought that he was a bit 
peculiar but I thought this is a nice 
riding rig, I don't know what to make of him. So
I approached him and then he 
just jumped up and down and started saying 
things like, I told you, I told you. I did this,
I did that and as he was telling me he 
did things, I thought, oh no, I'm getting suckered 
into
this guy's shit, and then he finally 
looks down at me and he just yells. I love you,
I love you.
That's all he kept saying, I love you, 
I love you, I love you, I love you.
And I said I love you too.
I've been in the saddle almost 18 
hours and I was in the endgame now.
I had been riding a lot so I actually 
fell asleep on the saddle and he walked 
to my side of the rig.
And as he got to my side, he lifted 
my chin up and he kissed me on the lips 
and he said, we're going to do 
some great things together.
He said to me, don't ever forget that 
today I saved your life and he hugged me, and 
then we walked off, and I'm going to 
walk off at some point, but I don't have the 
energy so you'll have to deal with my eyes.
It was an amazing day.
(music)
I am in a good mood. I've been able 
to take a couple good naps 
throughout the last 24 hours, I've been 
well fed.
All of this is great, but I feel like 
we need to go ahead and make a detour 
or a side road in here. This looks like a great 
place to ride, so let's turn 
off the road here.
I will get off my motorcycle. Please 
do not eat my boots.
You know, one of the things that I love 
about this bike is that it gives you 
just enough stability to walk off the 
bike and also just enough torque to not blow off 
the bike in case you might,
like I did, start walking into oncoming traffic. 
Sometimes the bike wakes me up, and 
that's because it starts trying to fall over 
but it stops before it falls over. I don't know 
if that is a good thing or a bad thing.
I'm gonna try to get that out of the 
way, my bike is in front of me.
Now I can't get that out of the way, so it 
is still stuck in the middle of the road.
When I got off the bike, I was like, 
wow this is a great place to be 
right now, let me try to keep moving.
I'm not gonna lie, getting off the bike 
was a little bit difficult. I was on the right side 
of the bike and I'm not sure if
that makes it harder or easier. It makes it 
just enough harder that I have to go one way 
or the other. It makes it easier in that the 
seat is much more low to the ground so it makes 
it a bit easier to move around when I'm 
on the ground. When I first got here,
I wasn't sure how I was going to ride, 
I was a bit uncertain how I was going to ride, 
and it has ended up being fine. It just
takes me out of the saddle enough to let 
me breathe while I'm moving along and 
the bike lets me keep rolling. It's a good system.
I'm just going to continue forward here, 
as soon as I get a chance to change position.
So when I got off the bike, I immediately 
started having a little trouble breathing, 
and I also realized that this
is something I've never really paid 
any attention to on any other day, but 
it is something you really should pay attention 
to. 
I have some trouble breathing when I'm in a 
position like this.
But I can't reach up high enough to my 
neck to 
feel like I'm getting a decent breath.
I know this isn't going to be the best 
idea, but I'm going to take this 
bottle of water, just like I've done 
a million times before.
And this is for another problem 
that we're gonna have, because
I also have a hydration bladder. And when 
I have to use the hydration bladder, it's always 
really bad, so, I'm going to 
have to take the time to set that up.
I'm just gonna take that 
bottle of water with me.
It's always a good idea to 
check and make sure the water 
level in your bladder is low. Sometimes
your bladder will go empty
in the middle of a ride, which is really 
no fun. To make sure it is ready to go 
and filled, I'm just gonna pour this in.
This is a little bit more difficult 
than I expected.
So I'm just gonna stay 
upright for the rest of the ride.
This is quite possibly the worst 
spot for me to be in.
I'm going to stay upright 
because it's very very hard to fall off the bike when 
you're upright and moving along 
when you're upright and moving along.
I can't be on the 
ground because it's very very hard to get back 
up on the bike once you're down on the ground.
If I fall off, and this is why it is a bit 
difficult, I have the right side 
of the motorcycle in front of me, that is a 
good place to break your fall, but you're 
gonna have to get over the bike, over the seat, and then 
your body will have to go </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:49
