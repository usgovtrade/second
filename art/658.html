After watching the video in full, try to decide what happened and why it happened by reading my comments, 
or by yourself. Then give me your opinion. And you can see 
what someone wrote next!

A:

Well that video is extremely confusing! To some it's pretty clear what is going on but for me the whole thing makes no sense. The only thing that is clear to me is that one of them is feeling a bit sick and the second says "I'll go get something to drink" and comes back with cans of beer. To me that is the most likely explanation for what happens during the rest of the video!

A:

I'll start by pointing out a minor detail, not found in the answer of Kajinto, but it's also the first thing that I noticed:

 In the second frame, between the first two girls, the text is rotated to where you cannot read the two girls names. However, you can still read them, as they have no capital letter, unlike the second words of the first one.

I think the video is somewhat explained here.

 There are 2 girls in the video who apparently cannot dance at all. They go to the bar and go inside to get a drink. On the way to the bar, they pass by a small house where someone is selling something. They ask for a piece of food (or at least I assume that is what happens, I'm not 100% sure on that one) and get some snacks to eat.

Note the red arrows:

 The girls apparently have to get inside the house. There, they drink their drink. They both seem to like it, and are very talkative. You know, because they have had a drink of alcohol in their mouth.

As to what they actually saw inside the house, I believe

 They saw a mouse

The next part where they start to dance is explained here:

 They see the mouse and then say "there's a mouse". They then dance to something like "a mouse dance".

Note the blue arrows:

 The girl that seems to not be too talkative says "and there's a mouse." To which the other says "no, I'll dance." The non-talkative girl starts to dance, and the other is still drinking her drink. While dancing, they are very interested in eating and talking to the mouse, while continuously drinking their drinks. Eventually, the other girl, apparently bored of their situation, just ends up drinking her drink and walking away.

Once they go back to the dance floor:

 The mouse somehow comes out from where the girls are dancing and walks towards them. They continue to drink their drinks. Now with no mouse in sight, the second girl has nothing to talk about, and the first one is a bit scared to see a mouse. So, they talk about whatever is there to talk about.

After a while of talking about stupid stuff:

 ...a cat walks out of nowhere and runs by the dance floor. They look at the cat and the cat runs off and they talk about cats for a few seconds. The second girl gets scared of the cat and the first one goes after the cat to protect her friend. After that, the first girl starts dancing again and gets bored of the entire situation.

Conclusion:

 While the second girl is not really drunk, the first one is. But the second girl is really thirsty, and so she drinks her drinks before her friend is and drinks her second can of beer as well. This can possibly explain why she was so quiet during the later parts of the video.

To those of you who still think it's strange, here's a picture from the movie in question:

Note that the 2nd girl is the one in red.

I have some more observations:

 Since the text is not vertically aligned, you can read the full name of one of the girls, since it's not a whole sentence.
 The girl with the text "the food" is supposed to be a man since it was written as a little boy, if I was in the author's shoes. (I was using The GIMP when making this explanation, so some parts might be off and can be fixed).

A:

Another version:

The two girls in the video, A and B, are on a night out. A says, "Hey B, what you seeing? C: Hey, B, what are you seeing? C: oh hey! That's the girl from this morning! D: oh, yeah, right."
A girl from a previous conversation, D, sees A and B dancing. D is jealous of the girls and walks up and down by herself. The guy with the sandwich (C) is tired of dancing and tries to help out the girls by dancing with one of them.
One of the girls asks the guys for some refreshments. She gets two cans of beer.
The camera zooms out and you see the guys taking some beer, with the girl.
A girl calls out: "Excuse me, excuse me! I have to go."
Then there's a time gap. The first girl is seen taking a drink and she starts to dance again. Her attention is on the mouse.
C: "Hey, hey! Stop dancing like that. It looks like a circus to me." "Yes, yes I know. And look there!"
A girl: "Oho! hey, aren't those the two girls from yesterday?" "Oh, we really suck!"
The video stops, as the conversation is not very interesting.

The conversation above is the summary I got from the video.
Edit: I noticed that the time between each frame is 4 seconds, it's like the video is a bit fast.
