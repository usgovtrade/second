really serious about joining the work force."

"That's what I've been saying to myself," she said. "But I'm so nervous 
and I'm not even sure I have what it takes to work for a company like 
Enron. How can I decide what to do if I never try?"

Tiffany and I laughed, and then I asked her a question that was on my mind. 
"If you were to join Enron, what would you do?"

"You know," she said, "I really don't know."

"Tiffany," I said, "I think you need to be a little more specific."

She looked at me and said, "You know, if I were to join Enron, I guess I'd 
start as an administrative assistant. 

I looked at her and asked, "Tiffany, why do you want to work for Enron?" 

"Well, I don't know how much of an administrative assistant I would be. But 
I'd want to see how the company works. I'd like to get to know more about 
what the company does, and how the company makes money."

And that's why I joined the Enron Corporate Staff Program. This summer we 
will be adding eight new members to the Program, including Tiffany. The 
members get the chance to meet with peers, work on projects, attend 
conferences, and network. Of course, the ultimate goal is to find a job at 
Enron. 

The Corporate Staff Program will be held in Houston, New York, Portland, 
Omaha, and Chicago. Make sure to attend, and if you have any questions, feel 
free to contact me. 

Sincerely, 

Alicia
