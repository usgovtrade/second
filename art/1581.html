"You haven't even told me what this is all about." "You're out of time." "Tell me what I need to know and you'll be treated well." "If not, things will get much, much worse." "Who are you?" "I'm the one who decides whether you live or die." "But I can tell you this." "I have absolutely nothing to lose." "I don't believe you." "What do you want?" "Everything." "Lincoln!" "Dad?" "Oh, my god, are you okay?" "Dad, I'm so sorry." "I'm so sorry, I didn't know they were doing this to you." "You should have come to me." "There was a reason why I didn't come to you, dad." "I didn't want to put you in danger." "You're my son." "There is nothing that could ever make me think that coming to you would put you in danger." "What did they do to you, dad?" "This is what I have to deal with." "That's why I left." "That's why I couldn't tell you." "Why I can't tell anyone." "Dad, what are we dealing with?" "You son of a bitch." "You killed lincoln!" "No, I had nothing to do with that!" "I'm trying to protect you!" "I left, because the people that are after me," "I made a deal that if I ever went back, they'd kill you and your mother." "No matter what you think, no matter what you believe," "I love you more than anything in this world." "You are my son." "You're lying." "You don't have to lie to me, dad." "Just tell me the truth." "You're right." "I made a deal." "So I'm going to show you." "Take a look at this." "A nuclear bomb?" "You think a nuclear bomb that size is invisible?" "I built that for a client years ago." "It never went off." "It doesn't have to go off." "All you have to do is drop it in the right place." "Where is it?" "Where it'll do the most damage." "And where's that?" "San Francisco, in a place where a lot of our military facilities are near nuclear power plants." "San Francisco?" "Right where we're standing." "I told you, I left so you'd be safe." "The deal was, if I ever went back, they'd kill you and your mother." "I'd never hurt you." "Not hurt me?" "Dad!" "Dad!" "Dad, no!" "Dad!" "Dad!" "No, dad, don't!" "Don't!" "What the hell did you do?" "You told me that you destroyed it, that it would never hurt anyone again." "Did you destroy it?" "Not exactly." "If you had just left me alone, none of this would have happened." "Lincoln..." "Who is that?" "I don't know." "Dad, dad, are you all right?" "You must leave." "Take her with you." "And what about you?" "There's no time!" "We have to get as far away from here as we possibly can." "There's a truck." "Take this." "You have to go." "I will not run away from my home." "Dad, I'm not leaving you behind." "I'll be right behind you." "Just go." "Go, go, go!" "Lincoln!" "Are you all right?" "Lincoln!" "Lincoln!" "Hey, you all right?" "Lincoln!" "Lincoln?" "Are you okay?" "Are you all right?" "Let's get him up." "Let's get him up." "Let's get him up." "Come on, let's get him up." "Help me!" "I got you." "You're going to be okay." "I got you." "You're going to be okay." "You're going to be okay." "I got you, you're going to be okay." "You're going to be okay." "Look at me, look at me." "You're going to be okay, you're going to be okay, look at me." "Look at me, look at me, look at me." "Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me..." "Lincoln!" "Lincoln!" "Lincoln!" "Help me!" "Help!" "Lincoln!" "Lincoln!" "Come on!" "Help me!" "Please!" "What are you doing?" "!" "Please!" "Dad!" "Dad!" "Dad!" "Dad!" "What are you doing?" "!" "No, dad, dad, no, please, dad!" "Lincoln!" "No, dad!" "Please, dad, dad!" "Lincoln!" "I'm sorry." "I'm so sorry, lincoln." "Dad!" "No, please, dad, no!" "No!" "My son is dead because of me." "Lincoln is dead because of me." "And I have to live with that every single day." "I'm going to turn myself in." "Dad..." "Dad..." "If we do what's being asked of us, no one else will have to." "They'll let us live in peace." "That's not peace, john." "I have to try." "We both do." "What's going on?" "What's going on is your mom and me are leaving." "We're going to live with dad for a little while." "We're going to figure out a way to make this work, okay?" "But we have to go right now, okay?" "Dad's waiting." "You okay?" "I have to stop them." "There are a lot of them." "I'm going to stay with lily." "They'll be looking for me." "You take care of lily." "Okay?" "Go, go, go, go, go." "Go!" "So, if you find any information on the people that used to work here, just call me, okay?" "Thank you." "Hey, what about them?" "They're staying with us." "We have plenty of room." "You know, it's funny, I was just coming to see you." "Can I talk to you for a second?" "Sure." "What's up?" "I was going to go with you today." "Oh, yeah?" "You wanted to be here." "You're a hard worker, you're good with people, but I can see you're still struggling." "With what?" "Losing your son." "My son has been gone for almost a year now." "A lot has happened in the past year." "Look, I know you're going through a lot, but we have a business to run." "We can't afford to have you feeling sorry for yourself all the time." "What if I told you that was exactly why I was staying?" "Then I wouldn't do it." "Listen, if you change your mind, just let me know, okay?" "Excuse me, sir?" "It's time." "Get his shirt off." "No!" "No!" "Look, it's okay." "You're all right." "You're safe now." "It's over, all right?" "It's over." "Listen, I know what it feels like to lose someone you love." "It feels like there's nothing left to live for, but life has to go on." "It's okay." "Okay, it's okay." "You're okay." "You're all right." "Come on." "This place is a lot better than the place we're staying at right now." "We could fix it up." "I'm going to take the first shift." "I'll see you at dinner, okay?" "Dad?" "Hey." "Hey." "Are you ok?" "Yeah." "What are you doing up?" "I can't sleep." "What are you doing up?" "My son is dead, and it's all my fault." "I know." "Sometimes I..." "I'm so scared." "It's terrifying to think about the worst thing that can happen and then make it happen." "You can't think like that." "What's this?" "Did you get this from lily?" "No, she wants to go with us." "What?" "Yeah." "She's getting out of there." "Come on, we should get some food." "Do you want some?" "Do you even know what I'm saying to you?" "Yeah." "You want us to take her with us?" "Yes, I do." "Look, lily's been through a lot." "She shouldn't have to go through it anymore." "Come on, let's eat." "Come on, let's eat." "You sure?" "All right." "All right." "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched." "They must be felt with the heart." "Hello." "What can I get for you?" "Just give me a menu." "And I'll order." "Right." "What?" "I can't do this." "I'm sorry, what are you talking about?" "It's the food." "I can't do this." "This isn</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:11
