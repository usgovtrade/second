Each of them is named after a human male who is a member of a team. According to Matt Salinger, they serve as the characters in his "wacky version of the United Nations."

The name "The Bots" was invented after Andrew Dossi made the mistake of mentioning how funny it would be if there was a robot band on The Big Bang Theory, thinking "The Rats" was an inappropriate nickname. Matt Salinger mentioned he was watching something where a robot band was part of it and said "Wait, what?" and "How perfect."

Appearances

Appearances in The Big Bang Theory

The Bots debuted as an unnamed group of robots, performing an unknown human song called "Hey Future Hubby," on season five's ninth episode, "The Decoupling Fluctuation."

Though they were initially nameless, they have since been given individual names: "Carmen Bot" by Leonard, for her large breasts, "The Bots" by Sheldon, and the ones on-screen are named "Brent on the left, R2D2 on the right" and "M2, the guy." All of the band's members were named after humans who were members of a previous group. The entire band (including their human members) were given backstage passes to "A Night of Too Many Stars" by Leonard in "The Decoupling Fluctuation," and they returned in "The Agreement Dissection." The robots returned again in "The Hook-up Reverb", where they perform "Big Giant Head" and "You Look Good in a White Tee". They returned again on the last episode of season seven, to perform "A Change of Heart."

In "The Tangible Affection Proof", the Bots also have a robot band member, named "Morty on the left, Rick on the right" in which everyone calls him "Rick Morty," presumably to avoid confusion with Star Wars character, R2-D2, named after his friend, Rick Dempsey.

Appearances in The Marriage Ref

In The Marriage Ref season 3, episode 4 "Tricky Business," the Bots are invited to perform at the wedding of Sheldon and Amy. Their appearance is disrupted by Leonard and Penny who take the bridegroom to a strip club and Penny gives Sheldon a lap dance.

The Bots have an appearance in the season 5 finale, where they return after Sheldon tells them that he is willing to pay them $20,000 to come back and do what they did the first time: perform at his wedding. Also, Leonard has asked them to take Amy out again, this time using an advanced love potion that causes him to make any wish she makes into reality. The Bots' song is called "I'm Not a Good Villain," which is ironic, since Amy asks if they are bad guys and Sheldon says "No, they're good guys." The Bots are the bridesmaid for Penny and Leonard's wedding and they do the band thing and even have the dance routine that they performed in "The Tangible Affection Proof."

It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia

The Bots have a cameo in the episode "The Gang Reignites the Rivalry." They perform "Carmen Bot" (the original) and "A Change of Heart" when Dennis, Mac, and Sweet Dee visit a party at Howard's. They return in "The Gang Wrestles for the Troops," again to perform "Carmen Bot" and "A Change of Heart" at Charlie's Halloween party. In "The Gang Dines Out," the Bots perform at the waiters party, which prompts Charlie, Dennis, Mac, and Sweet Dee to join in on the music as the audience.

Appearances in other media

In an April 26, 2019 episode of The Big Bang Theory titled "The Scavenger Vortex," Sheldon and Howard discuss the possibility of turning the Bot performing at Sheldon's wedding into a musical with a book, as well as doing a Broadway musical of Big Bang.

The Bots appear in the Sheldon's Mind Palaces episode, "The Bots," voiced by Chris Williams. Penny has a crush on Carmen Bot, but is afraid to ask her out, so instead she creates a robot boyfriend for herself that sounds like the Bots. Sheldon comes up with an idea for the Bots to play at Penny's birthday party, which involves placing Penny's human boyfriend in the trunk of a car.

Sheldon and Howard meet the Bots when Sheldon hears his old band's music and becomes inspired to create the band again. Sheldon sends them an e-mail about how he plans on getting the band back together. When Sheldon asks why the band broke up, the robots respond, "The robots stopped making us." After being shown a video of the breakup, Sheldon explains that robots are no longer part of the human population, so they are not included in his theory of "the six universal forces." Despite this, Sheldon has the band come back together for a one-time appearance for the wedding reception of Sheldon's former professor and later girlfriend, Ms. Wick. At the wedding, all of the original Bots agree to play music for Sheldon's wedding reception. Because of the marriage of three of the original members, Howard, Leonard, and Penny's relationship, and Sheldon giving out his phone number to the lead singer, they had an opportunity to meet Howard's old girlfriend, Ms. Wick. During the wedding, all of the original band members were reprogrammed by Ms. Wick to break Sheldon's heart. This caused the original robot band to be permanently broken up.

Appearance

The robots are in no way an accurate depiction of modern robots. Their outfits are patterned after a carousel horse and the Bots have three eyes, unlike all other robots (including the B9), which are often portrayed as having only one eye. In a scene from "The Scavenger Vortex," Sheldon describes how his band will eventually get back together and perform the "I'm Not a Good Hero" song: "Imagine four little men on a stage, and the four little men are dressed like this." It is not yet known if this scene takes place in the future.

The Bots are voiced by Chris Williams (episode "The Bots"), and Kevin Rath (episode "The Scavenger Vortex," season seven episode "The Equation Group"). The lead singers are referred to as Carmen Bot, who sings and speaks Spanish, R2-D2 on the left who speaks, as revealed in "The Bots" episode, Klingon (which actually is named after the film and not the Star Wars character) and M2 the "guy" with the "big giant head" in which no one knows his name. The music director, Dr. Dmitri, is played by Eric Pumphrey, but is mostly only seen in the "The Equation Group" episode.
