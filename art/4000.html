History

First label (1998–1999) 
Kawaii! Records is a record label that produces various Japanese-style idols and visual kei musical groups. The name "Kawaii!" was chosen as a means of "bringing together various idols and all sorts of talented artists and to showcase the beauty of all of them". However, due to having no office or staff, the label is only managed by Aki Nishimura through her personal management company, which is based in Tokyo. During the time span of when the label formed, Aki was a scout who discovered Kajiura Yuki and worked with her until the latter's departure from the group in 2000.

Their first release was an album by a female R&B group named Onmyoji, which debuted at #7 on the Oricon charts. Their second release was a pop rock band named Hi-Hi Club who were a duo of twin sisters, that also debuted at #7. They had their own concert series called Kami-Shichigosai where they performed at Shibuya Parco.

Second label (2000–2001) 
In 2000, the group released a compilation album named Uzu-VK (VK is the abbreviation of Visual kei) and a live DVD. At the same time, they formed a sub-unit called KAWAIi!!. Hi-Hi Club had left the group in December, and Hi-Hi Club had announced they were going solo as a sub-unit named Hi-Hi Club+ in September. Then they released their first single "Shibuya" in December. They had their own concert series called KAWAIi!! Yakyu Shichigosai at Shibuya Parco.

In 2001, Kawaii! Records had collaborated with various bands and artists, such as Exile, Jasmine, M.I.L., and T.M.Revolution, and managed Japanese artists Aoi Teshigawara and Miyuki Hashimoto.

Third label (2002–2004) 
In 2002, the label started a new sub-label named Kawaii! Junior. At the end of 2002, Hi-Hi Club had announced their graduation. In May 2003, Kawaii! Records had announced a sub-label called Kawaii! Music. From then until July 2005, the company only released albums and DVDs under the Kawaii! Music sub-label.

In 2005, T.M.Revolution had left the label. In November, Aki's sister, Yūki Nishimura had joined the company as a coordinator, as well as a sub-label called KAWAi! Music. KAWAi! Music also produced music for various bands, such as M.I.L., Aoi Teshigawara, and Miyuki Hashimoto.

In 2006, a sub-label called KAWAi! Muscat was formed in order to produce all of Aoi Teshigawara's albums. Aoi had also released a single in July and announced her graduation in October 2006. In April, Hi-Hi Club had announced they were graduating in March.

Fourth label (2007–present) 
In 2007, Aoi Teshigawara was promoted from KAWAi! Music to Kawaii! Records. Hi-Hi Club and Hi-Hi Club+ had both graduated in February. At the end of 2007, T.M.Revolution released their first new album in six years called Revolution Summer. It also features Hi-Hi Club's song "Summer is Magic" as a hidden track. In February 2008, Kawaii! Records had collaborated with the band Bif Naked and released a single.

In 2008, Kawaii! Records had collaborated with a new group named Aqours, which were an anime-only band that was announced on the seventh episode of Kirakira PreCure a la Mode in May 2007. In September, the label produced a live DVD for Hi-Hi Club+. In March, the label began a collaboration with a new band named Nekomura Natsumi.
