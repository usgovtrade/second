More specifically, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of a melt-sprayable fluororesin comprising a fluororesin powder which is obtained by melt-spraying a fluororesin powder with a fluororesin binder in which the melt-sprayed product is obtained as an agglomerate of the binder.
Melt-sprayed fluororesins such as tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP) and tetrafluoroethylene/ethylene copolymer (ETFE) are used in various industrial fields, for example, as electrical insulating materials for cables, sheaths of wire, and tubes, as materials for electric wire coatings, etc.
JP-A-53-48122 discloses a melt-sprayable fluororesin comprising a fine powder of a fluororesin and a thermoplastic resin having a softening point of not higher than 150.degree. C. and being capable of finely and uniformly dispersing the fluororesin particles therein, which melt-sprayable fluororesin is melt-sprayed with a melt flow rate of at least 15 g/10 min and which is excellent in thermal shock resistance and high voltage electrical characteristics (JP-A=Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.).
JP-A-2-286864 discloses a process for the preparation of a melt-sprayable fluororesin by melt-spraying a powder of a fluororesin with a melt-sprayable binder. More specifically, this reference discloses a process comprising feeding a powder of a fluororesin in a gas stream to spray said powder at a temperature of 300.degree.-900.degree. C. with a stream of a melt of a thermoplastic polymer having a melt flow rate of at least 20 g/10 min at 350.degree. C., to thereby prepare a melt-sprayed product comprising the melt-sprayed binder and the melt-sprayed fluororesin. According to this process, a molten binder forms around fine particles of a fluororesin in a gas stream, and the binder is uniformly dispersed in the powder of the fluororesin to form a molten product (melt-sprayed product). According to JP-A-2-286864, the melt-sprayed product is pulverized, and then the pulverized product is melt-molded into a form, for example, granules, tablets, bars, or films.
JP-A-6-169570 discloses a melt-sprayable fluororesin which is obtained by melting-spraying a powder of a fluororesin and a melt-sprayable polymer having a softening point of 40.degree.-150.degree. C., with an amount of the melt-sprayable polymer being 0.1 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the fluororesin, using a twin-screw kneading extruder. More specifically, this reference discloses that a melt-sprayed product prepared by melt-spraying a powder of a fluororesin in a gas stream with a molten binder, has many macro voids, and said melt-sprayed product is pulverized, the pulverized product is pulverized again, and the pulverized product is melt-molded into a form, for example, granules, tablets, bars, or films. According to this process, however, it is difficult to obtain a product having a high mechanical strength, since the melt-sprayed product is pulverized again. Also, melt-spraying the binder using a twin-screw extruder, forms a high speed melt flow of the binder in a gas stream, which increases the size of agglomerates of the binder.
JP-A-6-169568 discloses a melt-sprayable fluororesin comprising a fluororesin and a binder, wherein the binder comprises a thermoplastic fluorine-containing polymer having a melt flow rate of at least 25 g/10 min at 350.degree. C. and having a weight-average molecular weight of less than 5,000 and a fluorine-containing polymer having a weight-average molecular weight of not lower than 20,000. More specifically, this reference discloses that a melt-sprayed product is melt-pulverized, and the pulverized product is melt-molded into a form, for example, granules, tablets, or films.
Further, JP-A-6-169570 discloses that according to the melt-spraying process using a twin-screw kneading extruder, the melt-sprayed product is prepared by melt-spraying a powder of a fluororesin with a molten fluorine-containing polymer as a binder in a gas stream.
In order to obtain a melt-sprayed fluororesin powder having a high softening point, it is necessary to use a fluorine-containing polymer having a low melt flow rate or to melt-spray the fluororesin and the fluorine-containing polymer together. In order to obtain a melt-sprayed fluororesin powder having a high softening point, it is also necessary to finely and uniformly disperse a binder in a powder of a fluororesin. It is, however, difficult to prepare a melt-sprayable fluororesin powder which is free from agglomerates of the binder, and yet has a high softening point.
On the other hand, it is generally practiced to melt-spray a melt-sprayable fluororesin with a binder using an extruder having a screw provided therein, and to pulverize the melt-sprayed product obtained. However, when the binder has a low melt flow rate, the binder is not uniformly dispersed in the powder of the fluororesin, and the product obtained becomes irregularly shaped.
An object of the present invention is to provide a melt-sprayable fluororesin powder which is free from agglomerates of a binder, and yet can be prepared from a melt-sprayable fluororesin and a binder in a simple process, for example, melt-spraying the fluororesin with the binder by using an extruder.
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a melt-sprayable fluororesin powder which is free from agglomerates of a binder, and yet can be prepared by melt-spraying a fluororesin with the binder by using an extruder, which process is suitable for mass production.
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a melt-sprayable fluororesin powder which is free from agglomerates of a binder, and yet can be prepared by melt-spraying a fluororesin with the binder, in which the process comprises melt-spraying the fluororesin with the binder, and then pulverizing the melt-sprayed product to give a powder which is usable as a material for melt-spraying or for direct molding.
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin which has a high softening point and which is usable as a material for forming melt-sprayed products by melt-spraying with a melt-sprayable binder, melt-sprayed products prepared by the process for the preparation of a powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin, and melt-sprayed products prepared by melt-spraying with said powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin and a binder.
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a melt-sprayed product obtained by melt-spraying with said powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin and a binder.
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a melt-sprayed product obtained by melt-spraying with said powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin and a binder.
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a melt-sprayed product obtained by melt-spraying with said powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin and a binder and a material other than said powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin, for example, a material comprising a polymer other than the powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin.
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a melt-sprayed product obtained by melt-spraying with said powderous, melt-sprayable fluororesin and a binder, and said melt-sprayed product.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:27
