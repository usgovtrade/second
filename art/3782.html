You don’t know me,” the girl screamed out. The teen was identified as a runaway in an attempt to get the suspect to stop the beating. This is what happened next: The girl jumped over a bench and attempted to run down the street. The suspect followed, hitting her over the head with a rock as the two ran. As the girl, still screaming, reached a driveway near a home, she tripped and fell on her face. The suspect kicked her once in the head and another time on the buttocks. The girls cried out, asking the suspect to leave them alone. He then left the girl face down on the street and ran back to his original victim, who was still screaming loudly.

When police arrived, they found the girl battered, bruised and lying face down in the street. Her eyes were swollen shut, she was bleeding from the head and had bite marks on her buttocks and head. The injured teen was taken to the hospital for treatment.

“I don’t understand, she wasn’t the one doing this to him. Why did he do it? Why did he leave her?” the girl’s mother asked. “Why would he leave his own daughter?”

“They look like kids. They’re 16. What’s going on?”

“For now, we don’t have the answers,” said Sgt. Ryan Abbott of Longwood Police. “He doesn’t have any priors and is very remorseful.”

The teen who beat up the girls was only released from juvenile detention last week. Investigators are unsure whether the same guy who beat them up was also responsible for throwing the glass bottle, but they are trying to determine if this was just one unprovoked act.

“We’re just really disturbed that something like this is happening at all,” Lt. Jason Vail said. “We were just hoping they would be okay and never come into contact with anybody who was violent like that. So the girls were fortunate.”

The teens are from a neighborhood near Vickers High School. Police said the attacker did not know the girls were on their way to the school. One of the girls did not attend Vickers, but lives in the neighborhood.

“This is not just about the two people that are hurt, but there are people out there that are feeling safe,” Officer Jason Vail said.

Anyone with information on this case is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 800-423-TIPS.

I don’t know what is so confusing here. I’m not sure why this is so hard to understand. The person who hit this girls with a rock first also hit him with the same rock later on. If he wanted to stop the beating he should of stopped hitting him in the face with a rock as soon as it was going on. And he should have called the police when the girl ran away in the first place.

It’s easy to be an “apologist” when a person is doing the right thing. We see it daily in society and it looks like the “bad” people are always more important to defend than the “victims”. It’s one of the reasons people tend to avoid police. If you see a police car and you’re at a red light or whatever, you will step over or into a parking lane, just to avoid contact. Why? Because society’s apologists have gotten a foothold. Why even risk your freedom for someone else’s? After all, he’s going to put you in jail. No one is calling for violence on the suspect. I wouldn’t expect anyone to justify violence on the victim. But we are dealing with the actions of a predator that has to be stopped. What does it take to draw the line? A female being raped to the point that she is unconscious, and then strangled to death is a horrific crime. In what world is that OK? I’ve spent a lot of years in law enforcement, and no one I have ever met would ever excuse what happened in Florida. No matter who it was. What would it take for anyone to give up their right to not be punished in order to save a victim’s life? It is so important that every victim be protected to the max. That’s why we are trained to defend. To prevent more harm, even if it means the end of the law-breaker.
