Mon, 27 Nov 2017 00:01:52 +0000http://chowhatcheeze.net/?p=1118This tasty chicken recipe is a great low-carb meat recipe to serve for your next dinner party. Tandoori marinade creates this tandoori chicken from scratch recipe as it will give you a more authentic experience, but a homemade one is better than store-bought for flavor and freshness. This post was originally published on Chowhound. How to make your own tandoori chicken recipe with …

This tandoori chicken recipe is an excellent low-carb meat recipe for the following reasons:

1)You can make it just the way you like it! You will have some leftover marinade that you can use again, and it is a great way to preserve your food.

2) Make it from scratch. No one ever had better chicken, if you really cared about quality and freshness.

3) Have it with rice and raita, which is a yummy Indian condiment made with yogurt, garlic, and spices. Use raita as a base to put cucumber, carrots, and chopped bell peppers.

4) Have it in naan or chapati breads, because we have some really awesome bread recipes on this site, and the kids always love Indian food. Indian food is very good for kids, as they aren’t as spicy as their American counterparts.

5) It is a great and delicious way to spend your next family gathering because you will be hosting and making a meal, not attending a restaurant or caterer.

How to make your own Tandoori Chicken Recipe

1) Cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes. Remove the skin from the chicken (if it has skin) as this can become tough and chewy in the oven. Season the chicken pieces with salt, pepper and any other spices you like.

2) Marinate the chicken for at least 15 minutes in a bowl of cold water and marinade in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup of tandoori marinade to the bowl and add the marinated chicken pieces to it. Keep aside for another 15 minutes, or refrigerate if you are making this ahead of time.

3) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Take the chicken out and wash your hands and the plates you are going to use. Drizzle some oil on the plates. Put your Tandoori Chicken pieces on the plates. Bake for 20-30 minutes or until the juices are cooked and look good.

4) Serve and enjoy.

Tips:

The secret to good Indian food is in the Marination

It is recommended to marinate it overnight to get better results

Marinate the chicken in a bowl that has been rinsed with water
