My team did just the same thing.”

His “fans” agreed with him. Nope, he didn’t miss a beat. He’s more comfortable than ever. At his core, as a football player, Wuerffel is a people pleaser. He’s not satisfied unless everyone loves him.

After his post-football comeback in the booth, Wuerffel was offered a gig as a commentator at NBC’s Super Bowl XXXIX between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Oakland Raiders. But it would be a return to a position he had already been doing for years. A decade and change before that, he began his television career as the play-by-play voice of the Florida A&M Rattlers.

Wuerffel, however, saw an opening in another TV booth. He interviewed Tim Tebow for one of his TV gigs.

“Tim, man, he’s got the most competitive spirit I’ve ever seen. He will not stand for anybody to feel sorry for him,” Wuerffel said. “What’s interesting about him is it seems like it’s on his mind all the time. He’s passionate. This is the only life I have. This is where I’m at right now. And I don’t want to let him down.”

After the 2007 season, the Aggies made a move to the Sun Belt Conference. Their fan base didn’t grow with them. During his time in Jacksonville, Wuerffel and Tebow connected as roommates. Even if they were miles apart in stature, they didn’t spend much time apart on the field. The Aggies were more successful than in any other year in their brief history, but Wuerffel and Florida A&M were also headed to the end of the road.

Wuerffel’s senior season in 2007 was his most memorable as a player. That was the year Tebow arrived on campus and the Aggies rose to No. 15 in the country.

During his interview with Wuerffel, Tebow explained what it meant for his personal and professional growth to have his new teammate on his team.

“We are kind of similar,” Tebow said. “I know I could be a competitor like I am, and it just really gives me a lot of confidence. I look at [Wuerffel] as my little brother. You know what I mean?”

In his book, The Offseason Almanac, Wuerffel discussed the relationship he shared with Tebow that final season at Florida A&M. They were close not only because of their competitive natures but also because of their Christian faith. When Wuerffel would lose at his job, he got frustrated. He didn’t do anything to hide it. It wouldn’t take long for that behavior to rub off on his teammate.

“Timmy’s the type of player that, when he loses a ballgame, he’ll go in and beat himself up for like an hour,” Wuerffel told the camera. “If we had had another game that week, I swear I would have quit the team.”

His competitive spirit had limits. Tebow was willing to throw himself into the process but not everyone around him was as committed to helping him in his pursuit of the goal. At the time, everyone agreed that would be the final season for both players. Both of them wanted to leave their mark.

“Both of us really came into our own,” Tebow said. “Me in particular in that last year, we got to be great teammates for each other.”

Their last team, the New England Patriots, went on to win the Super Bowl that season.

Wuerffel’s football career ended about as well as it possibly could for him. It was filled with personal triumphs and highs. He went from a walk-on in Tallahassee to a walk-on in the NFL. As he was playing out his option year in Tennessee, however, he was injured. His season ended early, and he was sent home without playing a game. When he finally got his chance to start in Jacksonville, it was a short-lived one.

On his podcast this past December, Wuerffel reflected on that career-changing moment at Florida A&M.

“I was a walk-on trying to make the team,” Wuerffel told the camera. “You get in this kind of locker room, and if you aren’t a good enough football player, they’ll cut you pretty quickly. Well, they cut me. We made the NFL, which was great. We had the No. 1 pick in that draft and so much more to come. So I was really disappointed that I was getting cut, and I was told I probably shouldn’t be playing.”

Wuerffel, however, has no regrets. He knows he is his own person and that the game of football made it easy to understand why players made some of the choices they make. He knows what it takes to be great and he doesn’t care what others think of him.

“I know when my time’s up, I’m going to look back and I’m going to say ‘Did I live my life that I wanted to? Did I try to help? Did I have fun? Did I love my teammates and do everything I could to help them?’” Wuerffel said. “If I don’t get an answer to that, I don’t know what it’s going to be.”

Even when he’s trying to do his job, people make it easy to be entertained. Wuerffel has no problem finding someone to blame for his mistakes. Even as he admits he would make certain decisions differently now, Wuerffel has no problem with his own judgment as a young man.

“This is what I do want people to know. I was not an angel,” Wuerffel said. “I had choices to make every day. There were times when I didn’t love who I was making those choices for. And I didn’t love who I was as a person, either. There were times where I did, and I’ll never regret my involvement in the world of college football.”

Even in this time of his life, where he’s already accomplished a great deal and achieved a level of celebrity, Wuerffel’s biggest goal is his next. He talks about it regularly on social media, his podcast, and on the field with this team.

“Why? Because it can never be taken away,” Wuerffel told a fan on Twitter.

After all he’s been through and accomplished, his biggest dream is to raise $500,000 for charity. In three days, he has raised more than $1.5 million.

He’s on a mission to make the world a better place and to show young boys everywhere that there’s another way to live and succeed in sports. To do that, he’s going to be a teacher. A tutor. One of those people who is there for the kids.

When he looks back on his career, will Wuerffel miss football?

“No,” Wuerffel said, smiling. “Well, I miss it every day, but no, I don’t miss it.”

Still, there’s no denying he misses his teammates. But his competitive spirit is still the same. Wuerffel can admit he was part of a losing culture. He admits he knew what it meant to be a man. He didn’t always play with his mind, though, like his teammates, coaches, and teammates who’ve been drafted to be professional players.

“It’s my fault,” he said, smiling. “I couldn’t fix a lot of things. But it wasn’t me not trying. I tried really hard.”</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:41
