Reception
Upon release, "Cult Like Cult" received acclaim from music critics, with some comparing the song to "We Close Our Eyes" (2010) by the Gorillaz. The Guardian commented that "'Cult Like Cult' showcases [Nas'] ability to combine grimey beats and jaded subject matter into a dance floor-destroying track" whilst HotNewHipHop commented that "he's doing his best to prove he's here to stay and won't be easily pushed aside. If you had any doubt, 'Cult Like Cult' eliminates them." In 2014, The Quietus listed it at number 28 in their list of the best 140 snippets of songs.
