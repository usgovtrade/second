When asked how she felt about working so much in the public eye, the 45-year-old revealed: “You can’t get away from it.

“I have always tried to do things that are good for the world or to help people. I’ve always tried to live what I sing about in songs, and it’s no fun doing that when you’re hiding away.”

The star also revealed that she didn’t have children as she found it too difficult to juggle her work, her home life, and parenting, saying: “I thought having children would be hard work, but I was wrong. It’s harder.”

She also revealed she felt pressure to conform to her image of the ‘good girl’ and felt people would judge her for saying something that would damage her image.

The star also revealed that she was worried about revealing secrets she’s hiding away from the public as it might destroy her career.

The singer also spoke out on her personal life and said: “I’m very single. I don’t have much time. I have to pick and choose.

“I’ve got millions of fans, and I’m constantly having to check my personal life doesn’t affect them. I’ve always been very careful with the way I look after myself.

“The only people that know what I do for a living are my family and friends. I never discuss it unless it’s necessary.”

She also revealed that her work meant her personal life was at risk of being in the spotlight. She said: “My personal life comes first with everything that I do. But you know it’s the last thing in the newspaper – because my personal life has nothing to do with my work.”

The star also revealed that she feels she doesn’t need to conform with public opinion. “I was taught to look a certain way, to speak a certain way, and to behave a certain way, because I’m a celebrity.

“Actors conform because they have to. In my world you don’t conform.

“You just wear what you’re comfortable with. If you don’t like what you’re wearing, you can change. I’m not happy unless I’m comfortable.”

In the end, the star also told the magazine she’s happy to be who she is and won’t apologise for her fame. “If it didn’t happen, it wouldn’t be this. There is a reason for everything I do.”

So there you have it, this is how the singer of ‘Twist and Shout’ feels about fame. There’s a lot we could say about this, but this is how she feels. As celebrities are usually so quiet, you might want to remember this when reading the comments and sayings of some of your favorite stars.
