Saranac Lake

This sleepy village is an ideal vacation destination that does not attract quite the same number of tourists as places like Lake George or Loch Sheldrake. Saranac Lake gets quieter in the summer and has a more rural feel to it than other nearby towns, though its charms are appealing to everyone.

The name 'Saranac' is the Eastern Algonquian name for a small animal, possibly a beaver. In 1693 a treaty was signed here between the French and Abenaki peoples. Over the years, these fur-trading entrepreneurs established European communities in the area, at first at Lower Saranac Lake (1695) and then at Upper Saranac Lake (1787). In 1803 they bought most of the land from the local Ojibwe and the town they called 'Saratoga' grew up here. Some of the original structures are still standing.

The village is home to the Saranac Lake Summer Theater, which serves as a great place to see movies (tickets $7) during the week. The community also has an active cultural calendar, including concerts, community theater performances and the popular Saranac Lake Folk Festival, held on Labor Day weekend.

In the warm months, the town has a wonderful vibe. In the summer months there's often live music outside the Saranac Inn; check out what's happening at the  Saranac Lake Visitor Center (   518-891-6135;   9am-5pm Mon-Sat, noon-4pm Sun).

Saranac Lake is a good place to buy hiking and camping supplies for the Adirondacks. The town has many places to find your gear, from REI (   518-891-5656; www.rei.com; 3 Depot Plaza;   10am-9pm Mon-Sat, 11am-8pm Sun) to Cabela's (   518-891-8500; 2845 Main St;   9am-6pm Mon-Thu, to 8pm Fri & Sat, 11am-6pm Sun) .

Taconic State Park

Some call it 'the crown jewel of the Adirondacks,' and it's easy to see why. Spreading over 1100 acres in the scenic Taconic Hills, it has more than 80 lakes (some of them connected by small rivers). Most of the area's trails are day hikes; however, many of them are also good for strolling or cross-country skiing, especially during the winter. The park also offers rustic camping, fishing and bird-watching (rare in the Adirondacks), as well as a number of good restaurants and inns.

In warm weather, you'll see hikers and mountain bikers making the trek to the peak of Mt Pisgah. At 4239ft, it is the park's second-highest mountain. The mountain, one of a half-dozen in the vicinity, offers spectacular views of the Taconic Hills and the Catskills to the east. The climb takes about an hour, but be sure to take in the view at the top first. This hike is a good place to find woodchucks, squirrels and birds. There are more than 40 miles of trails here.

Rock climbing, one of the more popular sports in the park, is also permitted on a small section of the mountain. For a list of trails, pick up the excellent map for the area from the  Taconic State Park Office (   518-474-9370; Rte 44;   9am-4:30pm Mon-Fri) , near exit 23 off I-87. You can also buy trail maps and check out park rules here.
