Asparagaceae) and commonly referred to as Mexican or Butterfly Agave, and in the trade simply as the Mexican Agave, and hereinafter referred to by its cultivar name ‘Neva Sky’.
The new Agave is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor, Gabriel Danziger, in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. The objective of the program is to create a new Agave cultivar with better habit and greater yield compared to other Agave cultivars.
The new Agave originated from a cross made by the inventor, Gabriel Danziger, in January of 2010 in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. The female or seed parent is the Agave tequilana ‘Sky Princess’, unpatented. The male or pollen parent is the Agave tequilana ‘Blue Boy’ (unpatented). The new Agave was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross in a controlled greenhouse environment in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel in October of 2010. Asexual reproduction of the new Agave by vegetative tip cuttings was first performed in January of 2011 in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel, and has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new cultivar reproduces true to type.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:28
