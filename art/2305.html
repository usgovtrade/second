This new book by Pastor Tom Sine gives you a fresh, inspiring approach to God's Word. As he tells the story of how God changed his life, you'll see how God can change your life, too. And even if you've been a Christian for years, you'll discover fresh perspective on the Word from one of the nation's most beloved pastors. Inside you'll find:God's grace isn't "given" to us. It's "given to us". When we receive forgiveness and learn to believe in it, then we are free to live the life God intends for us to live. When you do God's will, you become a witness to his love and grace, and you fulfill God's purposes for your life. And when God is at the center of your life, God is always at work in your life. When he is first on your mind, he gets all your thoughts. If God's first, what are the chances he's last? Jesus invites you to "just go for it" in faith. You don't need to wait for the road to clear. The road is now clear. And don't wait for another person, place or thing to make a difference. God is in the work. And God works through people. He works through you. When you go for it, God becomes a vital part of your life. And he uses your life to do the same for others. When you follow God's lead and allow Him to change you, you discover "Saved" God's new identity for you. You become a new creation in Jesus. Your soul is saved, you're made new, you're adopted as God's child, and you are born again. When the world says you're alone, you don't have to be. You are a member of the family of God. Your life is now forever different. There's nothing you have to do but say yes to Jesus, and begin a new life on a new path. With God, all things are possible. And in Jesus, God opens up his kingdom, where he invites you to be born again and again. So if you're not saved, or if you've gone a long time without coming to Jesus, it's not too late to do it. Jesus is always ready to welcome you home. There's a wonderful life waiting for you. And Jesus invites you to accept it. This book was inspired by "Just Go For It" by Tom Sine, a New York Times bestselling book, now in its tenth year of monthly publication.

This is the second book that Sine has written with the same message. He uses short, easy to understand chapters to illustrate his points. Sine takes a very detailed and logical approach to what it means to be a Christian, how to become a Christian and what is really involved when you are "saved." He provides an easy and simple way to understand God's will for us, which is what the bible is all about. Sine keeps it simple, which makes it easy to follow. Once you start to really understand what Sine is saying, you will really enjoy reading this book. I was skeptical at first, since I am more of a Bible geek, but found his simple approach to be logical, easy to understand and fun to read. It is hard to not be a fan of Sine now.

He seems to approach his belief of what it means to be a Christian in a very "user friendly" manner. He takes it easy to understand, while keeping the Biblical foundation intact. If you are going through a really hard time and are not quite sure how to get out, this is a good book to read. His "just go for it" message provides a good way to get past the initial difficulties in life and onto the path that God would have you on.

This book made me look back at my life to see how God's presence has been with me. The book challenges you to live the life you are saved for, "just go for it". It is a well written book and easy to understand. It will help you understand God's plan for your life and help you discover the peace that you need in your life.

When I'm in trouble, I reach for this book first. For those who are not so sure of their faith and life-don't read this book. This is not an easy read. But it is challenging. When I'm ready to move on from my old life and look for new, God-giving ways to live, this is one of the ones I turn to. I am not perfect, but God is faithful and will never leave me. I can't guarantee that this book will answer your question or question "God", but it will help you work things out for yourself. It is so easy to come to God when you are in trouble, it's what people who are used to God-like a way of living and doing things do. This book will not change your life, it will challenge you and you will thank God for it in the end.

I've enjoyed reading most of Tom Sine's books and this is one of my favorites. It's short and simple but the message is deep. Sine shares with the reader how we are to live our lives in God's world. He calls us out of our self-centered ways and reminds us that God's plans are bigger and better than our own. This book was an excellent choice for our church small group. It was thought provoking, practical and timely. The timing could not be better because of the times in which we live. The book is a guide to being all that you were created to be as a child of God.

The writing style and the story line was written so it may be read in any stage of your life.I did like how the story was presented. it gave me a lot of new ideas in my life, and i enjoyed the feeling i got after reading this book. the book does make you think about why you would read the book and how it is important to know God's plan.I think this book is a good one to read. I liked the part that said" go for it!" what it meant was something that i can try to apply to my life.

The content of this book is very helpful as you read it. It has good information in it and it gives you a new way to look at your life and what is right and true.

This book is great! As a Christian, I felt like I was reading a new chapter to help understand God's plan and make sense of the Bible, and how to actually live my life according to what God has to say. It's not too heavy on the Bible, but just gives you enough information to explain the content. The only down side is the length; it's really short, so you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:18
