Kvothe is back in The Wise Man’s Fear, a story that reveals a darker side to the story than ever before.



In the first book in the series, Kvothe is hailed as one of the greatest magicians in the land of his birth, Boteivis, but in this tale he has a very different legend attached to his name. He is a master storyteller and musician, a chronicler who has an unrivaled insight into the human heart.



For years he’s kept a hidden dark secret: for years he has been the Chronicler of an evil magician, and this very well may be his undoing.



The world is at war. The kingdoms have fallen and nightmares walk freely in daylight. A shadow moves in the twilight between the living and the dead, and the final battle between Light and Dark is coming.



Kvothe is a hero, but his legend is one of a very different sort. As he searches for a stolen treasure, an ancient force awakens, more powerful than ever before, and against it Kvothe may not stand a chance.



With the release of The Wise Man’s Fear, comes the third book in The Kingkiller Chronicles: the highly anticipated third novel in The Wise Man’s Fear trilogy, The Doors of Stone.



"The plot, characters, and style of writing have so much of Patrick Rothfuss' original trilogy that it is clear to me this was written with a lot of care and thought given to the style and language used to create a whole new story in an epic setting of magic, heroes, and monsters."

"The Chronicles of Kvothe are simply some of the best I've ever read. . . . [Rothfuss is] capable of building a universe that feels organic and believable without being distracting."

"Rothfuss' ability to write with grace and complexity both amazes and delights . . . The more you read Kvothe, the more you feel you know him."

—Entertainment Weekly



"Kvothe is a hero, and yet, it's clear that he has his own set of faults and his own demons . . . And those demons come calling for Kvothe, too . . . Rothfuss' writing is so evocative and so good that the journey in reading the books, whether it's through one book or all four of them, is one that can't help but be emotionally affecting."

—The Escapist

"The entire package, from the worldbuilding to the character development, is masterful. Kvothe is a perfect choice for any epic fantasy fan."

—Heroes & Villains

"Kvothe is not just one of my favorite characters in fantasy literature, but one of my favorite characters of all time. He's a good guy who loves music, who loves to drink ale, who loves his friends, who loves women, who isn't always nice, who tells bad jokes, and who does incredibly bad things. He's a flawed man with great courage, imagination, and humor, and I love him."

—The Book Smugglers

"I'm so happy to see that fans of the previous books will not be disappointed. The worldbuilding, the action, and the mystery make this a can't-miss book for any lover of fantasy."

—Night Owl Reviews

"The story is epic in scope and beautifully written. By the time I finished, I had a new appreciation for one of the great creations of fantasy literature."

—Chronicle Of A Dysfunctional Family

* * *



"The series is a truly epic epic, so if you don't like massive story arcs, don't worry, for every one of those you'll find a number of stand alone stories that are small but beautiful. The point of The Kingkiller Chronicles is not to tell a singular story, but to examine the nature of stories and magic and how they work."

—Bleeding Cool

"From Kvothe's hilarious story within a story at the inn to his more epic narrative about the kingkiller to his tales of his adventures when he was a boy, the Kvothe is amazing, complex and very compelling. Rothfuss' prose is fresh, his worldbuilding rich, and his characters full of life and depth. His ability to convey the humanity in all his characters, in spite of their supernatural powers, makes the Kvothe unique and memorable."

"You're about to read one of the best books ever written. One of the best fantasy series ever written. One of the best fantasy books ever written."

—Warren Ellis, comic book author

"Kvothe is one of the finest characters ever created in the realm of fantasy fiction. . . . The Kingkiller Chronicle deserves the highest praise."

—SF Site

"The Kingkiller Chronicle is a true testament to the talent of Patrick Rothfuss."

—SFFWorld

"If there was any justice in the world, this would be getting one of the biggest awards around. But then again, if there was any justice in the world, the author would be more than a little more money and better off. But he's just as funny and eloquent as he has always been. If that had happened, I would have asked for a better bottle of wine. But then again, who the hell am I to judge? Patrick Rothfuss is an exceptional storyteller, and that will continue to be a fact until the day he dies."

—Strange Horizons

"Masterful. . . . One of the most refreshingly original voices in fantasy today. I'm eager for whatever else Rothfuss has in store."

—SF Signal

"Kingkiller is a story to be read more than once, to be savored. The language is beautiful and Rothfuss’ prose is a delight, but the story is the point—a true epic fantasy, complete with quests and monsters and betrayal. I was enthralled."
