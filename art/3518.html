Reception seemed scary but it wasnt what i expected basic to be. My first time was on the 14th jan. My roommate got lucky that day and got to hangout with one of the nurses and got hooked. I liked it here but they are so anal about drugs and you have to have a physical every so often with a nurse taking care of you, if you are found to have a condom on your person they kick you out for 2 days. They say they wont do anything if you don't get caught. I just wish they were a little more open minded but so far i love it here. I love my group of friends, they are great and i love the dorms, they are smaller than my parents house.

I started going to the clinic as a patient and my therapist is amazing!! I would take her over my therapist any day! It's been around 3 months since I've started and I have already seen some improvements in myself! Just a suggestion is, if you find a therapist that is helping, don't give up! Keep going to meetings and keep working with him/her! I feel that is the most important thing you can do when dealing with mental health, to make sure your on the right path. The best part of going here is I found them on Google, no stings or anything like that. I would definitely recommend this clinic to everyone!

Marijuana is a drug as well, you should be aware of the effects of marijuana and its affects on the brain. If you are a habitual user, please take a break from campus.

Clinic +1.14 miles from the campus center

Not too bad.

The clinic is clean and tidy and most of the staff are very friendly. Every week, we are told to come in to go over the rules. At least every month, we're shown how to properly use our inhalers. There is one part of the clinic that is a little dirty, and there are also some people who I don't know in the waiting area. Some people are a little annoying and inconsiderate, but over all the clinic is alright. The staff are very nice. My therapist says she's very knowledgeable about bipolar disorder. The therapy sessions are very interesting and helpful. This is definitely something I would recommend to anyone who has depression or bipolar disorder.

I've been going here a year now and I would have to say this clinic is the best experience that I've had with going to therapy. As a kid, I never liked doing therapy, but the staff here makes the experience enjoyable and fun! They make you feel comfortable and welcome. The best thing about the clinic is that they are very open about what medications you should be on and if you aren't ready for them, they would rather you be on the medication for a month or two before coming in to do the therapy and be adjusted to it. They also help out with your insurance and have a very clean atmosphere. The clinic also goes above and beyond to help out in any way they can which is awesome.

I'm in the process of starting to see a counselor here at this clinic. I'm so impressed with how friendly and open the workers are. My counselor makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. The therapy I've gotten thus far has been very helpful, and I'm hoping to continue to make progress. It's also so clean and neat in this place. I love it so much. They have all kinds of resources here, as well as a bunch of pamphlets for depression, anxiety, and stress management. I think this place has been really helpful for me in my fight to overcome my depression. I hope you all get the help you need!

I would give the clinic a full of 5 stars if it weren't for one small flaw. It seems that the clinic is trying to be a bit too perfect with rules and policies and that in itself is off-putting, especially for the client. The counselor that is assigned to me tries to get me to "follow the rules," which sometimes I do and other times I feel they are excessive. I think there are exceptions to every rule in order for the clinic to function efficiently, not every rule is meant to be followed or should even be followed. The counselor for me right now is amazing, she really tries her best to help and is very patient.
