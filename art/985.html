going to keep such unreasonably high standards for men.  Just because 
someone doesn't carry on a multi-year committed relationship with you 
doesn't mean that you automatically have the right to withhold your 
consent.  I'm not saying that you should give your boyfriend a hall pass, 
but I do believe that any rational person would not want to lose the 
opportunity to actually be with the man that you claim to love so much, 
because he made one boneheaded move.  He didn't hurt you, cheat on you, or 
lie to you.  He was too weak to carry on an actual relationship.  You know 
what you are?  You're an emotional terrorist.  You say to a guy, "I just 
want you to love me and not give me any crap," but you're actually 
expecting him to sign a contract that says you'll never get angry, never 
talk about anything besides him, and never have any emotional needs of 
your own. Are you crazy? He's not a Hallmark card. No, he doesn't give 
you presents, but that's not because he doesn't love you, it's because he 
has no need to make you a present, he can't even buy a present for himself 
because you've already taken all his money. Why the hell shouldn't he? 
Because you gave him no choice. You basically married him by saying you 
were going to spend the rest of your life with him, never leaving, never 
saying no.  Men are just not built for this kind of thing. 
If you're not careful, you'll raise a whole bevy of men who either can't 
make it on their own, or can't make it on their own because of you. Maybe 
that's what you're going for. But what you're looking for is a little bit 
more than what those men are willing to commit to. It's understandable, 
but it's really pathetic. 
And, if you can't take him for who he is, and leave him, but you still 
love him, have compassion for him. You don't want to wake up in 20 years 
and find out that you've been left by the side of the road. That's why you 
ought to open up your heart, and give this relationship another chance. 
But you've got to decide right now, right now who you want to be with, and 
choose him. Not him, choose him. If you don't, your life will be, to use 
your own words, "A disaster." 
And you can't even say you haven't been warned.

FWD: Another email from a 'zine, this time from a guy who got dumped...

Subject: Bad News

I don't know if I will EVER be able to forgive myself. I'm afraid to even 
try. I'm just so heartbroken over my break-up. It was totally my fault but 
it was so hard for me to tell him no. This has been eating me up since it 
happened. It's just the thing that I always dreamed about, but deep down I 
knew it wouldn't last. It was kind of like a dream and I really believed 
it. But you know what, it wasn't a dream. We had sex and went out 
together. We did everything together. Everything was okay until he started 
getting abusive and we had the fighting and the crying and he stopped 
taking care of himself and acting like he had any respect for me. The 
biggest thing was when I finally confronted him about his friends. I'm not 
saying he did it because he has nothing to say in his defense. He was just 
not capable of saying no and he got super defensive, so I knew it wasn't 
going to end well. I even told him if he didn't say anything to me I'd 
asked about him. The break-up hurt me more than it's going to make you 
feel. We haven't seen each other since. He has moved on with his life and 
I'm trying to find the strength to move on with mine. I just feel like a 
jerk for even letting him touch me. It's just so embarrassing. But I've 
been doing better. I'm not as depressed. I actually go out and do things. 
Like see movies, like now. I just don't know when I'll be ready for 
someone else again. I know I'll be okay because we just did everything 
wrong. But you never know. I'm too scared to try again because it will 
never end well. I will always wonder if it was something I did or said to 
drive him away. I just can't believe I'm even capable of losing someone 
that I love so much. Sometimes I feel like giving up, but I can't. I 
promise, I won't screw it up again. I won't lose anyone else. I'm 
terrified to just give in to the fear that he's better than me because he 
should be. He knows better. He's learned and I haven't. And it's just 
fucking eating at me, I don't know what to do. Why is it so damn hard to 
tell someone no? And why did I care so much that he didn't hurt me when he 
was angry? Why didn't I just break up with him before he did it? Why was 
he allowed to get away with treating me so badly? I don't know. 
Sorry to be so long winded.

FWD: So you know how you can tell that a guy is a jerk and has no respect 
for women? Because when he's with her, he treats her like shit.
