In many ways, the first three games have proven to be the most revealing. We know now that the Senators can roll four lines that can put pucks on net and have a solid defensive core. In particular, the second line of Mike Hoffman, Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Kyle Turris have been dynamite in all three games. Hoffman has proven to be an outstanding playoff performer and Pageau has been a revelation. Turris was brought here to drive the third line and it would appear as if Ottawa is winning with him right where he needs to be. Mika Zibanejad was supposed to be the third line center, but he’s fallen flat in a fourth line role. His penalty for a cross check on New York’s Derick Brassard was a complete gift and he’s given up chances left and right as a result. Let’s see if he can regroup and get things back on track. As well as they’ve been playing, there’s still the underlying issue to deal with. The team is giving up almost five goals a game. As a result of it’s offense, the Senators have to maintain a positive possession pace to help make up for the goals against. The Sens can score five goals, but that’s not enough when they allow five.

The Next Step

The Senators are in position to make a good run at the Eastern Conference Finals and in particular, the Stanley Cup Playoffs themselves. They now have Ottawa’s fate in their hands. In three games, the Senators have shown they have the speed, power play ability, defense, forecheck and goal scoring. It remains to be seen how they perform in overtime and in a close game but so far, they’ve done fine. There’s a question mark surrounding Bobby Ryan’s concussion but if he’s unable to go, we can expect to see Thomas Chabot up in the Senators lineup. Ottawa also has a very unique opportunity to have its first All-Star Game representative this year. Erik Karlsson is a finalist in the Norris Trophy category. As well, Erik Karlsson will be in the running for the Conn Smythe Trophy and leading the Senators’ charge. If Karlsson can reach the next level and the Senators can build on their ability to score goals, look out for Ottawa in the playoffs. All that matters is that the Senators win. The Senators are still focused on the present and are fully aware of what lies ahead. Ottawa has the pieces in place to make the Senators a big time team in the playoffs, just as was envisioned when they made this team.

One of the reasons the Senators were so successful in the 2017 off-season was the fact they had a deep roster. If they had a weakness, it was in goaltending. It’s why the Senators took a chance and signed Mike Condon to a one-year deal. We’ve seen very little of the Senators’ backup so far this season and frankly, he’s been very impressive. In his first appearance, Ottawa was facing a red hot Lightning team. Condon gave the Senators a chance to win and then proceeded to be even better in the Senators’ 2-1 win against the Flames. The Senators desperately needed a win. Ottawa fell behind 2-0 early, but as Ottawa goaltending coach Pierre Groulx told me last season, the Senators aren’t going to panic. Even in his first NHL season, Condon is a calming influence on his teammates. Condon kept the Senators in the game. In the process, he managed to earn himself a new deal for next season and perhaps, an opportunity to go into the 2018 playoffs as a member of the Senators.

Game Log

5/2/17 @TBL: 2-0 W (OT)

5/4/17 PHI: 5-1 W

5/5/17 FLA: 3-2 OT W (SO)

Mike Condon has been stellar in each of his three starts. He came to Ottawa having never started more than 22 NHL games in a season. That’s not a long track record. Condon now has 39 games of NHL experience and he’s looked good in all three appearances. He’s posted a 0.958 SV%. Condon has given up four goals on 56 shots. That’s a 1.07 GAA.

The Senators were in desperate need of finding a goaltending solution. They brought in a goalie with a limited resume, who was a solid signing in net. Condon hasn’t just been successful for the Senators. He’s been impressive, something Ottawa didn’t have last season. With Condon on board, the Senators now have more competition for the goaltending position in camp. It’s a good problem to have, and it’s nice to see the Senators addressing the issue.

It was announced today that Mike Condon has signed a one-year contract with the Senators. He will become a restricted free agent this summer. You have to wonder if there was one team that Mike Condon wanted to be a part of in the NHL? The Senators obviously think so and it’s one of the reasons why he joined the organization.

Condon was an extremely interesting free agent signing. He seemed to have a great attitude and desire to succeed. His past NHL experience was limited and despite the fact he’s not flashy, he’s been very effective. Most importantly, he’s a very solid puckhandler and with his ability to play the puck and skate the puck out of the defensive zone, he should be a perfect fit in Ottawa. Expect to see him start for the Senators next season and potentially be their number one goaltender.

The Senators made the right move in signing Condon to a one-year contract. Let’s hope the Senators have a successful season next year as a result.
