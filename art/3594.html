"The good news is, we'll soon know the truth about this." "You ready for your test?" "Yes." "That's good." "Let me see your arm." "I'm sure I just scraped it on a branch." "I don't think so." "Why are we stopping?" "I could walk back to camp, and we wouldn't run out of oxygen for a while." "Do you need to?" "No." "I'll be fine." "We're close to the border." "Someone's gonna be on this side, waiting for us." "We're being watched." "The survey team, right?" "They set this whole thing up." "I think they're coming in closer to see us." "You do?" "We might be able to scare them off, if we run into them." "What if we don't?" "Run!" "Get back!" "No." "No!" "No!" "Oh, God!" "No!" "No!" "I'm pregnant." "I'm telling you the truth!" "We're not in the survey team." "We're just on our way home from the river." "Come on, we're on the same team." "Yeah." "Right." "Get in!" "They're heading this way!" "We need to jump down there and distract them." "I'll cover you." "Go on." "They're moving pretty fast." "Are you sure it's them?" "They've been following us for a while." "If they catch us, they'll kill us." "Well, that's reassuring." "No, I just meant that they can't climb trees as fast as we can run, and they'll probably trip and slide on the way down." "All right, ready?" "Come on!" "Go!" "Go!" "Hurry up!" "Hurry up!" "Can we climb up from the other side?" "No!" "Come on, move." "Do you think they saw us?" "Probably." "We need to get further away." "What do we do now?" "We're on the other side, but they've probably spotted us, so we have to keep moving, and hopefully they won't follow us over here." "It doesn't matter." "That's where we're going anyway." "The survey team is over that way." "There's no one over here." "We just came over that." "It's the wrong way." "All right, just relax." "We're gonna follow the river north." "Just calm down and walk slowly." "No!" "Don't shoot!" "Don't shoot!" "Don't shoot!" "Don't shoot!" "Hello?" "Hey, Dad." "What happened?" "They were in the truck." "That's all I know." "He says they could have been in the boat as well." "Okay, well, I'm at the boat right now." "Did he..." "Did he hurt you?" "No." "Okay, is there any blood anywhere?" "Okay, don't panic." "Are you with everyone?" "Is anyone hurt?" "Did he hurt any of them?" "No." "He just tied them up and didn't hurt anyone." "Well, who is he?" "It's that surveyor guy I met in the restaurant." "Yeah, he was with us at the river." "I thought it was him, but I think he was just the tour guide." "He made us take a different route home so he could..." "He knows we're coming home to Dad." "Mom?" "We have to make him tell us where the others are." "If they come after us, we'll have to..." "Look, I'll call you as soon as I know something." "I'm sorry." "I love you, too." "It's him." "The man from the restaurant." "He's been watching us, just like I thought." "He told me where to find them." "We can't let him leave the area." "All right." "Let's go back and get them." "No, we can't get past the river." "He knows where we're coming from." "We'll lure him out." "We'll set a trap for him." "Yeah, exactly." "Now, the question is, how do we get you off that boat?" "How long have you known about this, Mr. Parker?" "I had no idea that the survey team was in danger until three of my men were killed." "What do you want from us?" "That's not an option." "Actually, it is." "All right, what do you want?" "We don't have much of a choice." "I can make this very easy for you." "All you have to do is kill a man." "And I'm not talking about the men on that boat." "I'm talking about Mr. Burke, my son-in-law." "If you don't kill him, someone else will." "They don't have to kill him." "The people who kidnapped my wife and daughter are holding them in a campsite a few miles from here." "Well, I'll get your wife and daughter back." "Then Mr. Burke will get his wife and daughter back, and he'll get them out of the country." "What?" "We'll arrange for a plane to meet you on the other side of the border, just give us the word." "Or if you don't want to wait for your wife and daughter to be released, you could set up a meeting here." "How?" "Well, do I have to point out that" "Mr. Burke's brother-in-law works in the sheriff's department?" "That's right." "Mr. Parker, why are you telling us this?" "The last thing I want is for Mr. Burke or his wife to end up dead." "You know what?" "I'll make it easy for you." "You leave now, you drop the whole matter, and I won't kill him." "We don't trust you." "You let us do it." "I'll put my gun away and talk this over with your son-in-law, but we both know that's not gonna happen, so don't bother coming back." "It's your choice." "It's him." "The man who kidnapped our family is inside the camp." "You're sure?" "Yes." "We don't know if he can see out of that eye, but if he can, he saw you coming in here." "I need some clothes." "I'm going back to the camp." "No." "If we don't come back with his body, you can't prove he's inside there." "Yes, we can." "You're gonna walk out there?" "He's out of ammo." "If we have to go back to the camp to get a weapon, he's gonna see us coming." "Yeah, that's right." "But when he sees you two, he's gonna think that it's us coming back for him, not you." "That makes you the only witness to your brother-in-law getting killed." "We have to get to the camp." "If we do, we can get the others out." "Maybe he'll kill them instead of killing Ben." "No, he's not a murderer." "Besides, if he wanted to kill us, we'd already be dead." "He wants his wife back." "He knows we know about that and he knows we know about this." "Okay, so why does he want all this?" "I think he's gonna trade us to her." "You got any better ideas?" "No, but he's my son-in-law, so I'm gonna get close enough to hear what they're saying." "You go out there and try to see what he looks like and what's going on." "Try to get a weapon." "What about him?" "He can stay here and wait for help, but he has to be able to move." "All right." "Let's go." "Come on." "What about the sheriff?" "I'll try to reach him." "He's gonna have to help us now." "No." "No, I can't do that." "Well, if you don't do it, he's gonna kill Ben and Amy." "That's a risk I'll have to take." "Good luck." "You okay?" "Yes, I'm fine." "Get down!" "We gotta take him out." "Shoot him!" "I'm a cop!" "I can't shoot anybody, especially not an unarmed man." "Well, he's unarmed, but he's not not armed." "Just shoot him!" "Are you coming out or not?" "We're losing time." "They might be halfway to Texas by now." "Let's just hold off." "I think he's getting close." "I can hear his voice." "He's trying to lure them out." "So maybe we should go after them, huh?" "If you go out there now, we don't know what he's gonna do." "I don't care what he does." "He's gonna kill my brother-in-law." "Mr. Parker will take good care of him until he gets back." "You did all you could do." "Okay, so what's next?" "Well, we can wait." "No." "We can't." "And I don't know what Mr. Parker would do</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:35
