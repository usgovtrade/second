Publisher's Summary

From the author of The Black Candle: the story of African-American entrepreneurship in America and other classic works about black life, comes a lively history of the people who shaped the black experience. It traces the African-American family, from its pre-colonial roots in the Caribbean and the American South through its experience in this country.

As a result, the book is a history of the African American family from Africa to the twentieth century. From a time before there were any people of color in the Caribbean, Africans who landed on the New World shores were able to preserve much of their culture and build new lives for their descendants. This book presents the fascinating story of African people transplanted to the new world.

Drawing on oral histories, letters, and literary materials, Dr. Gomes reveals many untold stories about black life and how it has been shaped by this family heritage. Through many different ethnic groups—Caribbean, and African American, as well as slave and free—this book emphasizes the commonality of people and the way their individual histories have intersected to make an amazing legacy of African American culture. The author has made a valuable contribution to our understanding of African American families and what they have meant to our history.

As a white man from New England, I want to be clear: I am not African. However, the narrative of African-American history is one that I have become personally acquainted with and passionate about. This book has added more dimension to that history than other books I have listened to. The author's attention to detail and perspective on the history of African Americans is clear. I wish we could make this book required reading in schools and community programs. It would be so refreshing to have people realize that there are many aspects of American history that our students know nothing about. The story of African American families in America has been told before, but the author brings a new and insightful interpretation of the role played by families. A lot of hard work must have gone into the research and interviewing of participants that could only be matched by dedication to the telling of a true story. Many have never heard of the great African American abolitionists of the 19th century such as Frederick Douglass. The telling of their story is not an easy feat and has been done in a fair and balanced manner. If there is any complaint, it would be that this book was short.

The Black Candle by William G. Thomas was one of my favorite African American history books as a young man because of how much truth it contained and how much it allowed me to see the past from an African American perspective as well as an American perspective. The Black Candle made me think differently about a variety of things. It was very empowering for a young man in the rural South, but not exactly something that could be classified as literature. The other thing I like about this book was the use of African symbolism, which was something I was quite familiar with as a child. It was something that I was taught to see as positive but which was always present and always ignored. This book opened my eyes to the truth of race relations in America that exists in spite of the truth about the Negro. It was a story of a poor man coming to America and working as a slave, to becoming wealthy, and then being freed, and being able to become wealthy again. It was a great story with great characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about slavery, the Civil War, the history of our country, and who want to know about some of the greatest African Americans of the nineteenth century. If you have ever been intrigued by these questions, I suggest you start with this book.

William G. Thomas' Black Candle is an exciting, engaging story about the life of a free Black man who came from the Caribbean to Massachusetts during the 1640s. What makes it so remarkable is its description of family lineage. Growing up in New England, African-American people had very little knowledge of their history, and since the time when they were captured, kidnapped, sold into slavery, and so forth, no one had given them a history. And it wasn't until after slavery ended that an interest in genealogy was developed. Many young African Americans were completely unable to find their family roots. Many of the present African Americans had only a dim recollection of their early family past. It is a pity because their ancestors did not die when slavery ended, but rather were sold into another trade. Those who were sold became part of the West Indies labor supply. So, today you can see the results of the many generations of forced inhuman treatment of the African. African-Americans have a rich history that makes them what they are. With few exceptions, today's descendants of these slaves are well-educated, well-respected, well-behaved, good neighbors, and good citizens. They're our neighbors. We must appreciate and share with them. We should ask more about what is important to them, what is important to their culture, religion, family life, work, housing, recreation, and so forth. There is no question about the role of the African-American in today's society, and how much African-American culture has become an integral part of America's own. This book's content is remarkable.

The Black Candle is a collection of historical narrative that gives a remarkable look at the lives of blacks from their arrival to America to slavery and to present times. It does not tell us how to solve problems or give us a message. But it tells us about blacks through the eyes of those who have come before us. From the many stories of those who have gone before us we can only hope to know who we are and where we came from. This book should be used in all high schools and colleges as a textbook.

A fascinating book with all the elements that make a good book. A very good read</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:56
