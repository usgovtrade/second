Here’s the latest news on Gunners.

Arsenal’s latest transfer rumours

Shkodran Mustafi

Arsenal want to sign Shkodran Mustafi this summer and have offered him an improved contract to try and lure him away from Valencia, according to reports in Spain.

The Gunners have had problems at right-back with right-backs Hector Bellerin, Rob Holding, and Kieran Tierney all struggling for form last season.

Mustafi, 28, has previously been linked with a move to Arsenal but Gunners boss Unai Emery has been reluctant to add a full-back this window.

Arsenal are thought to have a big-money offer in for the defender who has previously been in talks over a move to AC Milan. Valencia are keen to keep Mustafi but would not stand in his way if the player wants to leave.

Arsenal have offered Shkodran Mustafi an improved contract and a wage increase but the Spanish club want him to sign, sources have told CalcioMercato.com

The centre-back has made 32 appearances in all competitions this season for Valencia. The Switzerland international has previously been linked with Arsenal before, having made 42 appearances for the Gunners in three seasons.

Mustafi was a key player for the Gunners last season but his performances have dipped this season. With Laurent Koscielny likely to leave, Mustafi may be moved on this summer.

It remains to be seen whether Arsenal will attempt to land Mustafi and his team mate Daniele Rugani.

Alvaro Morata

Arsenal are also targeting Atletico Madrid striker Alvaro Morata this summer. The Spanish international, who can play in central midfield, has had a strong season and made his 10th Champions League appearance this campaign.

Morata has already had plenty of success in Europe with Atletico reaching the Europa League final in 2017/18 before they were beaten by Marseille.

Arsenal have been scouting Morata on a number of occasions but could face competition from Manchester United and Tottenham.

Morata scored 12 goals and provided 15 assists in 31 La Liga appearances last season, and won the Ballon d’Or in the same year.

Morata has made 23 appearances for Spain with eight goals and six assists.

Sokratis Papastathopoulos

Arsenal have been keeping tabs on Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos and have already attempted to sign the 30-year-old in January.

The German international has made 31 appearances this campaign for Dortmund and made the PFA Team of the Year in Germany in 2017/18.

Arsenal have been impressed by Papastathopoulos and would ideally like him to replace Per Mertesacker, who is set to retire.

Papastathopoulos is reportedly ready to sign a new deal with Dortmund but needs convincing that Arsenal can challenge for the Premier League title next season.

Arsenal have been linked with many players in defence this season and Sokratis would give them depth in central defence.

Jadon Sancho

Arsenal have also been linked with Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho this summer, who scored two goals on international duty this week.

Arsenal have been linked with Sancho, who has three goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga this season.

Sancho scored on international duty this week as England reached the U20 World Cup final in the UAE. The talented teenager can play on either wing, or through the middle.

Arsenal are set to welcome Aaron Ramsey back to the club this summer, but could potentially look at Sancho if Arsenal are unable to land Alexis Sanchez from Manchester United.

Sancho has plenty of interest from other European clubs and Arsenal will have to pay close attention to any developments regarding his future.

Jadon Sancho will not be leaving Borussia Dortmund this summer, according to manager Lucien Favre, who is determined to keep the England international.

The Bundesliga side refused to pay Man City what the Premier League side had wanted for the winger earlier in the season.

Speaking ahead of Saturday’s trip to Hertha Berlin, Favre was asked by Bild if Sancho would leave Dortmund this summer.

“I think we can say that if the player leaves it will not be because we did not want him,” Favre replied.

Sancho has been heavily linked with a move to Man United this summer and Arsenal are also keen to sign him, though they face competition from Manchester City.

Arsenal are set to lose Hector Bellerin this summer, as Manchester United and Tottenham have shown an interest in the right-back.

The Gunners are after a new right-back this summer and have been in talks with Juventus defender Daniele Rugani.

The Italian has just been promoted to the first-team and has also reportedly been wanted by Chelsea. He has also been linked with Atletico Madrid.

With the Gunners facing stiff competition for Bellerin, Juventus will likely make him a key part of any deal if they do sign a right-back.

Arsenal are also keen to sign Inter defender Milan Skriniar this summer, and would like to buy another right-back as well.

Arsenal are set to lose Shkodran Mustafi this summer as they are ready to launch a bid to sign Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly this summer, according to Calcio Mercato.

The 28-year-old Gunners player is looking for a move after a season where he found himself on the sidelines due to injury and a string of high-profile mistakes. He also struggled against the opposition which is being expected to challenge for Premier League titles.

Mustafi struggled to deal with the high pressure of Champions League fixtures and, coupled with his age, it is becoming difficult to understand why he is still a first-team regular for Arsenal.

The defender has made 13 appearances this season as he has continued to lose his place in the starting lineup.

Koulibaly is being heavily linked with Arsenal and a move to the Emirates could be imminent.

Arsenal reportedly looked at the Napoli defender last summer, but the right-back has turned his attention to moving to Inter.

Arsenal are also after Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos this summer and have been linked with a move for N’Golo Kante as well.

It’s still unclear as to whether Arsenal will be able to add either to their squad this summer, as both sides will likely offer a lot of money.

Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka has been the subject of interest from Liverpool, according to reports in the media.

Arsenal have been linked with a number of players already this summer and could be prepared to offer the Switzerland international another new contract if they can push through the deal.

Xhaka, 28, has a £150m release clause in his contract and he’s reportedly attracting interest from Europe’s big leagues.

Liverpool are interested in the former Basel midfielder and the Reds could look to take advantage of Arsenal’s struggle to sign players in this window.

Mesut Ozil will also be a major target if the Gunners are able to negotiate a £350m move with Man United.

Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana has been the subject of interest from the Gunners, according to The Sun.

The England international has performed well for Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool this season and Arsenal have already been linked with a number of big players this summer.

Arsenal could look to challenge for silverware next season and have already been linked with several big names – including Mesut Ozil – and that could lead to them looking at Lallana and Arsenal’s recent history with the 26-year-old would suggest they should continue to pursue him.

Iwobi: If Ozil signs, I’ll be more important

Arsenal’s first signing of the summer could be Henrikh Mkhitaryan, while Arsenal are also in talks with West Ham over the signings of Issa Diop, Jack Wilshere, and Reiss Nelson.

Arsenal have been linked with a number of transfers but have been heavily linked with a number of players already, while they are also set to complete deals for the duo of Mkhitaryan and Diop.

Mkhitaryan has long been considered a top target for Arsenal, but the 30-year-old has already committed his future to the German club. The Armenian has two years left on his contract and has won both the Bundesliga title and the DFB Pokal with Dortmund.

Arsenal have been linked with another new signing this summer as they attempt to bounce back from a disappointing season.
