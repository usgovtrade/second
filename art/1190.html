The top Democrat in the Senate is calling on House Democrats to give more leeway to their newly empowered leadership team in Washington.

"Today's Washington Democrats are doing the right thing," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Thursday. "I've asked that the new leadership be given their marching orders and be given the resources and staff to execute the reforms we have worked so hard to achieve together."

Republican Party chiefs in some major cities are offering to provide space at their offices for people involved in forming local tea parties, reports the AP. The party officials say they hope local activists will help them with party membership, volunteering, and fundraising.
