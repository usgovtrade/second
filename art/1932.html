We will be discussing the impact digital can have on our industry, showcasing the trends and innovations we’re seeing in our customers’ and industry’s digital journey and how we can help make them more successful.

This blog post from Mike Avery provides great advice for anyone who owns or works with business and industrial real estate. It is from a marketing and sales perspective, but contains very relevant points for any business owner.

In fact, even if you are not interested in selling or leasing industrial space, these are some very valuable insights that could help you increase your profits, create a culture of continuous improvement, and position your business for long-term success.

I agree with his points about the need to:

Develop a deep understanding of how your organization creates value in the market. The same way you know what value your business provides to your clients, you must first understand what value your clients’ businesses create for their clients. The more you understand this nuanced relationship, the more likely you will be able to help your customers in ways that align to their business interests, and the more your sales and marketing programs will produce the results you are after.

Create an inventory of untapped marketing channels for your industrial real estate. How many people who are potential candidates for your space know about it? What is the best way to reach them? How many people know you have excess space?

The fact is, the real estate industry has a bad rap. Many people think of landlords as being greedy profit-mongers, or landlords as being people who don’t care about the residents of the community. There’s no denying that there are some bad landlords out there, but that’s like saying that there are some bad doctors out there. It’s only a small percentage of them. Just as there are great doctors out there and great landlords out there, the same thing can be said of the average industry professional.

He goes on to highlight how great industrial real estate operators think differently about marketing and promoting their space, to focus on their customers. He writes:

The typical industrial real estate owner isn’t focused on marketing. They invest in a great location and they provide nice facilities and attractive amenities, and they do so because they care about what happens in that building. By keeping a strong focus on being a great landlord, a true real estate owner makes himself an automatic top-of-mind prospect for many of his clients, who can’t help but think of him when they consider new locations.

The first step in being a top-of-mind prospect for your clients is to be in their top-of-mind. If you have great industrial real estate, be proud of it and let everyone you know about it. The more people who know about it, the more your space will be on their minds. In fact, the more people you know about it, the more likely those who do business with your space will be your future customers.

https://www.mikeavery.com/whats-future-industrial-real-estate/#respondWed, 16 May 2018 10:23:47 +0000http://www.mikeavery.com/?p=2362The Industrial Real Estate World Conference kicks off its 50th anniversary season by focusing on the question, “How will the Industrial Real Estate business model evolve?” The event is scheduled for May 18-20, at Nashville, TN’s historic Music City Center. A range of speakers will present their perspectives on the future of industrial real estate.

There are currently more than $12 trillion of real estate investments in the U.S., according to the Real Estate Research Council. That investment includes a lot of industrial real estate, and it’s likely to grow as the industrial manufacturing model evolves. But what will that future look like?

Three speakers with expertise in industrial real estate will provide their perspectives:

“I believe it’s essential for companies to have a strong relationship with their landlords to achieve cost certainty, access to flexible space, innovative facilities, and new technologies,” said Mike Avery.

Hewitt Associates, Inc., a full-service commercial real estate advisory firm specializing in tenant representation, is one of the nation’s leading real estate service companies, providing property management and professional services to both tenants and landlords. The company was established in 1924, and currently operates in more than 150 markets, including commercial office, retail, industrial, medical office, self-storage, and multifamily.

“Since its inception, HAAI has focused on creating effective and efficient solutions for the industrial real estate industry,” said Don Muehlberger, president of Hewitt Associates. “We have assembled a powerful team of industry experts, who are able to support our clients at all levels of the industrial real estate value chain, which will allow them to thrive as the industry evolves.”

For the past few years, Mike Avery has presented on various topics at HAAI conferences, particularly the Industrial Real Estate Summit & Exhibit. This year, his presentation is titled, “Cash and Trade-In Value in the New Industrial Real Estate Market.”

In this presentation, Mike explains what cash-and-trade-in value is, why and how it’s important to industrial real estate, and the challenges commercial lenders are facing in determining their exposure to trade-in values.

Trade-In values (TIs) are generally referred to as “earned income” or a “rental equivalent,” which refers to the actual rent that is paid for a particular piece</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:43
