that desperate." "It's not you,"  I spat. "She's a user."  "Well," he said, 
"you can tell him that he is."
"I'd be delighted." "By the way, did we get a drink Friday night at Shooters?"
"I didn't think you were going there."
"I had a coupon." "It must have been a slow night if you bothered to get a 
coupon."  "What's the matter? Don't you think the owner's cute? If he was a 
guy I'd still be with him. I'll be back in a minute, I'm going to the 
bathroom." 
I made my way to the can at the back of the bar, where I saw my ex-boyfriend 
talking to the barmaid.   "Hey," I said in passing, "I think you need to 
tell her you are not my boyfriend, and I am not your bitch." He looked at 
me, and said to the girl, "We're not together. In fact, I'd rather be with 
her."
The girl gave him a look, and said, "I'm not a whore." I turned away, and 
when I turned back he had asked her out. I couldn't help but think that the 
whole thing had been staged for my benefit, because one, we weren't 
together, and two, he was a flaming ass-hat.   Now I walk into this bar 
full of people I know, and they all start looking at me with this 
contempt. As I make my way through the crowd I say to myself, "That's right, 
I am a bad person. I am a horrible person." 
By this point, every drink I ordered got watered down. What was wrong with 
these people?   I had to find my friends; I needed somebody to talk to. I 
looked up the bar and saw them all huddled at a table by the front window. 
I walked over to say hello. This is when it hit me; they were the ones 
staging it. I thought to myself, "Oh, these are the people from the other 
night. They are the ones who picked me up and made me think I was 
celebrating my last night of freedom. God, they know me so well. My friends 
know how much I love Shooters. I love that bar so much I didn't think I'd 
ever be in a place where I didn't want to go home with somebody I met there. 
Now that I am out, what is it going to be like?  The drinks are going to be 
watered down. I will have to fake a smile as I listen to their stories of 
how they are all making it, "on their own." That's the night I learned that 
they don't have their own table. You get it, table. Do you?

I walked over to them, and said, "What's up? How are you guys?"
"What's up with you?" "What happened? How could you leave me alone in this 
bar with that asshole?" "You know, Tiffany, you just can't help yourself." 
I wanted to say that I wasn't thinking about him when he was in the room, 
but I refrained. "I don't know what he said to you, but he had absolutely no 
right to treat you that way."  "Yeah, right," I said. "I know."
"Where's Brad?"
"He was bored with the conversation," Lori said. "We didn't want to talk 
about work. No, I am sorry, you guys don't have to hang around here. I'll be 
fine." 
"No, we're all going to stay here." Brad said. "What a drag. I mean, for me 
it was easy, I was actually quite enjoying our discussion. I don't know how 
I could end up with a girl who actually speaks during a conversation. That 
never happens. At least not in a social situation."
He turned to look at me, and said, "You're not going to believe this, but 
I've never had a conversation with a girl in my life who did not work and 
was not either a bartender or a secretary. Are you an accountant?" "No, I'm 
a bookkeeper. You're thinking of those girls in the office, those with 
white-collars who wear glasses. I don't think you've ever met one of us." 
"No, I suppose not." 
"A bookkeeper, huh?" I said, "So what do you do?" 
"What do I do? I am the fucking president of the company." 
"Oh, yeah, me too. And I am the president's girlfriend." "I didn't know you 
guys were dating." "So, Brad, what company are you in?" "That is privileged 
information." 
"He has a point," I said. "He is making a lot of money." 
"Yeah, and I make some pretty nice noises." "I'll bet you do. My boyfriend 
has a very sweet gig at a publishing house. I can't wait for you to meet him. 
"

"That's so weird." "What? Why? I don't get it." 
"Because I work for a publisher too." 
"Yeah, it is kind of odd, but it is really cool." 
"I'm not sure how much I should say, but it is really cool." "Yeah, Brad, 
you and I have got a lot in common." 
"I'm not so sure I should be talking about my company." "He's fucking with 
you." 
"No, that's really it." "Just talking about how cool it is, and then 
whispering into his drink about a possible merger." "Yeah, that's the 
deal." 
We were all laughing about how the subject was so strange, and I said, "I 
mean, I can see a company being interested in our stuff, but still. It is 
really cool, the amount of power a CEO has over people." "I know, and that is 
what I mean. The guy is a jerk." "Yeah, he is," I said.

I took a sip of my drink, and said, "Brad, you are the most boring person I 
know." He frowned and said, "I guess I really shouldn't talk." 
"You are boring. I know it's the job and everything, but even your friends 
are boring. Have you ever been to one of their houses? Even their houses are 
boring. I mean, the art is nice, and the furniture is pretty, but everything 
is boring. They don't have a clue what is going on in life. They don't know 
anything about music, books, art, movies, or plays. They are so afraid to 
show any kind of vulnerability that you can't talk to them." "I guess you're 
right," he said. "It is like they're all on this same stupid hamster wheel 
and we all need to run on it together."

I wasn't sure if he had really accepted what I had said, but when we met 
outside Lori introduced me to Dave. He looked like a complete slob. He was 
sweating in this suit.   I looked at the name tag on his shirt, and it said 
"Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave." It was pretty clear that we were 
talking about the same person. "David, hello," I said.
"Hey, sweetie, thanks for coming down." He kissed me on the cheek and said 
he would be back in a minute. I said, "So you're Dave."
"Yeah, and I just got that last promotion in the company, so I have to put 
on a suit and learn how to talk to people." "A suit? Where are you going to 
wear that?" I asked. "You look like a slob." "We need to talk, woman." "What 
about?" "Our conversation earlier." 
"Oh, the girl in the bar. I really wanted you to go back in there and beat 
the shit out of him, but I didn't want to miss the chance to thank you." "I 
don't think so, but thanks." He stopped and asked, "How come you left?" I 
finally said that we had finished the first round of drinks. That seemed to 
satisfy him. "I just wish I had the balls to tell him to fuck off." "He is a 
complete piece of shit, isn't he?" I said. "If I see him again, I am going to 
give him a fucking." "Thanks for the support, sweetheart." 
"Oh, you know, well, it's what you deserve. I'm going to go back in. I would
