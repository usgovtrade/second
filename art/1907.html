This is a good chance for people to see the river run and maybe even hear a train whistle.

The annual festival — sponsored by the Riverside Historical Society, a local nonprofit — draws about 500 people to the festival grounds, which include several walking trails through rolling hills and a riverfront park along the Kern River.

One of the highlights for the day will be a special train run in which visitors can watch a train take the route that ran on the same track from 1911 until the rail line was discontinued in 1988.

The trains will be making regular stops for people to get on and off. The route will travel south from Riverside to Rialto and back.

At 4 p.m. there will be a fireworks display and raffle drawing.

And at 6 p.m. there will be a lantern tour that goes through the old cemetery and historic house, which dates back to 1900. The night tour will also show a movie about the history of the town.

The festival is Saturday and Sunday. The cost is $5 for adults and $1 for students. Children younger than 12 get in free. All ages are welcome at the festival.

The historical society also hosts Living History Days and an annual Christmas Open House the weekend before Thanksgiving. For more information, go to riversidehistory.org.

I believe the people living in Riverside at the time would be called pioneers, as they were the ones that built up Riverside in this particular area because it was a prime spot for them. I'm sure many of these same people still reside in Riverside today and they would still agree with many of the policies that govern Riverside today. The people who lived here 40 years ago know and understand the environment well. That being said I do agree with Mr. Neeley that as a Riversider, we cannot take care of our backyard. Our City Hall is like an old dog who has more fleas than we can count. I'm sure you have noticed them, Mr. Neeley. I've always loved that name, and it suits you well, having to be in Riverside Politics, but who's making the decisions? We've seen enough back stabbing and lies, not just from the Riverside City Council, but with the County also. Riversiders need to look at the big picture and see that Riverside is being taken away by bad decisions and actions from those above us. It's very easy to forget about your neighbor when it's your own backside that has been stinging from bites of more than one flea.
