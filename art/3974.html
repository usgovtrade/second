"What We Talk About"

"What We Talk About" is a song by Pink. It was released in August 2005 as the second and final single from her second studio album, Missundaztood (2004). The song was written by Pink and Joe McElderry. It was released on August 29, 2005 in the United Kingdom and on October 13, 2005 in the United States. The song features an unconventional sound, as the song is sung by Pink using mostly falsetto vocals. It is used to encourage people to "talk to each other". In the United States, it became her second single not to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number forty-two in Australia, sixty-one in Canada, and thirty-two in New Zealand.

In the United Kingdom, the song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number twenty-three, selling 15,845 copies. In the United States, the song peaked at number eighty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100. The single has been certified gold in Australia, where it sold over 35,000 copies.

Music videos

The music video for the song, directed by Francis Lawrence, depicts Pink as a young girl who sees a man fighting off someone who tries to take his house away. She goes into the house and steals an iron cross necklace from a girl who is being mugged. She proceeds to break the home's security system and ransacks it. She then hides in the home and finds out the man was in the army. She then dresses up like a man and joins his army. The next scene depicts her attacking with a weapon and a man falls to the ground. The video concludes with the woman getting sent back to the other person's house. In 2006, "What We Talk About" won a Teen Choice Award for "Choice Rock Song".

It was also nominated for a UK MVPA award at the 2006 awards ceremony, but lost to "I Don't Wanna Fight" by Timbaland.

Pink also re-made her first music video "Just Like A Pill".  Her second single, "U + Ur Hand" saw Pink wearing a black and white striped bra (also worn in her music video for "So What").

Another music video for the song was made in Japan. It showed Pink performing the song in Japanese. It was featured on the single's Japanese edition.

Live performances
The single was performed on a number of television and award shows. This included 2005's MuchMusic Video Awards, on which she performed the song with Jonas Brothers, as well as at The 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards, Party in the Park in Hyde Park, London, the Jingle Bell Bash at Kings Island, the AOL UK Music Awards at The Hammersmith Apollo, and the 2005 Glastonbury Festival, where she appeared in full military dress, with a hand grenade and a machine gun on the stage. The performance for the MTV Europe Music Awards was uploaded to the band's official channel on VEVO.
