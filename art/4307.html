One of the Rapids' players has told us he can "definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel"

The Colorado Rapids are playing like a team that wants to succeed this year. In their first two matches, the Rapids have yet to concede a goal in the first 45 minutes, and they’ve won one and tied one in their most recent matches.

“I know what we are capable of,” Rapids midfielder Martin Rivero told the club’s official site. “I know that in the games we have lost, there were some unfortunate incidents, but in the good games, we have shown how good we can be. We have the belief and the confidence that we have to improve on some aspects of the game. We are playing with a lot of confidence.”

Last year’s campaign was a struggle for the Rapids, who were last in the Western Conference. During the preseason, Rivero said the team was still working on improving individual skills. Rivero noted that these changes would help the team on the pitch.

“Right now, we are seeing that it’s starting to bear fruit,” he said. “We have an open style of play, so our mentality and mindset is to get behind the ball and make the opponent work. It’s been a blessing to see how it is working. Now, the question is whether or not we can improve on it or not.”

Rivero has made three appearances for the Rapids this season. In two of them, he has helped lead the team to victories. The 24-year-old Colombian recently told us that his team is starting to become a threat to any team it faces.

“Every game is different,” Rivero said. “It all depends on the opponent. I think that, right now, we are showing that we can do a good job against any opponent. We are scoring goals and keeping a clean sheet. We need to build more confidence into the team and keep doing what we are doing, but we have the belief that we are going to be OK.”

He has found a home with the Rapids and says he’s excited about playing for a team that’s expected to contend for the playoffs this year.

“We have two teams that are strong at the moment, but we feel that we have something special that we are working on every day and that we are getting better,” Rivero said. “Right now, we are starting to win matches and, right now, we have a belief that if we can keep doing what we are doing, we can make the playoffs and reach our objectives for this year.”

The Rapids have won their first two matches of the 2015 campaign. They face Real Salt Lake next weekend at Rio Tinto Stadium.

“For me, I think that it’s always nice for a player to score a goal to have his team in the lead," Rivero said. "It’s always important to do your best and help your team. I’m happy that I was able to do it today.”</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:00
