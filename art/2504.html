We started to look at people who are usually overlooked: the disabled community. Through this series, we got to get to know them and their experiences and tell their stories. We were also able to celebrate the lives of people who gave their last breath to prevent others from making the same fateful decision."

The premiere episode featured Tae-Hwa, a deaf young woman who was kidnapped by a stranger. She was later killed when the kidnapper lost control and strangled her to death with a cable.

To date, three of the episodes have been made available on Netflix in eight territories: Australia, New Zealand, the US, the UK, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark.

The remaining episodes will be released on Netflix in the coming weeks.
