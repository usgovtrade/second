I&#39;m looking to buy something in Chicago. I&#39;m from the midwest and would like to have some of the local flavor. I&#39;m interested in buying/buying wholesale from a small business (less then 20 employees). If you know of a specific supplier (in person), that would be a good place to start. If you can point me in the direction of a buyer or buyer&#39;s list, then we can make the trade and start a relationship. I&#39;m not trying to sell. If you&#39;re interested, my e-mail is myskidrow@bellevilleinbedandbreakfast.com.
<br />

In addition to your e-mail, please feel free to give some of your friends, other dealers, and interested individuals a call. If you&#39;re still wanting to buy and you happen to know where they make it, it&#39;s as easy as finding a few bottles that you like and have a discussion with them. You&#39;re trying to start something new with these people, which is a very good way to start an association with them. They&#39;ll love you for it.
<br />
<br />
And please drop in and say hello when you&#39;re in town. A lot of members of our Association of Indiana Grain Growers who are interested in beer do a tour at New Boswell on the first Thursday of every month. Hope you can join us.<br />
<br />

Good Afternoon,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response and we apologize for not having sent out your survey last week. We went through the same experience as you did with the spam filter and had no response to a few emails we tried to send out with some of the responses we received.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought about sending the link to an external page but it was too cumbersome. I just used the response as a part of a survey tool and it worked well. Thanks again for the comment.
