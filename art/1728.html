The final episode was screened at the Festival of Fantastic Films on Saturday 15 September 2008.

The Festival of Fantastic Films is a not-for-profit charity screening and festival of films and presentations for fans of science fiction and fantasy. 

The event was opened by former SFX Magazine editor Matt Baxendale, who commented on the film as 'a must see for any fan of genre film'.

The episode screened was the director's cut, which includes special effects that were previously omitted from the final broadcast version. The event was followed by an audio recording of an interview with the director, Stuart Gordon, in which he spoke about his previous work in the field of visual effects, his interest in 'weird subjects' such as haunted houses, spooks, witches, and monsters, and a range of other issues.

The DVD (distributed by Kaleidoscope Pictures) was released in the UK on 19 April 2009. The film is available in the NTSC format in all regions and the PAL format in most European countries. A Blu-ray version was released in the US by Scream Factory on 7 August 2016. It includes all the special features from the DVD edition and audio commentary by actor and author Mark Gatiss. The film has also been released on Blu-ray format by Arrow Video in the UK.

The film will be released in the UK for the first time on DVD in January 2020, with an Arrow Video Blu-ray release to follow.
