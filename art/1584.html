DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT
BETWEEN YOU AND VICTORY UNDER WHICH VICTORY GRANTS YOU
AND LIMITS THE SCOPE OF ITS WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION
WITH THE VICTORY PRODUCT OR SERVICE YOU ARE ABOUT TO
USE.

THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BUT
EXCLUDES ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY,
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, AND ANY
WARRANTIES WHICH ARE NOT LEGALLY REQUIRED TO EXIST BY
LAW.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL VICTORY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES
WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE
CAUSED BY LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
USE, LOST DATA, OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO ANY USE OF THIS WEBSITE, THE VICTORY PRODUCTS, OR THE
VICTORY WEBSITE OR VICTORY'S SITES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "PRODUCT") OR
ANY VICTORY CONTENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE

AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE ARE

COMPLETED OR TERMINATED. IF THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS FAIL
OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, SOME OF THEM WILL BE
ELIMINATED TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
REMAIN IN EFFECT.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE "LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY"
AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM.

These terms of service are subject to change at any time without notice, and are in
effect as of the date noted in the respective section. Your continued use of the service will
be deemed acceptance of these terms of service as last revised. If you do not agree to these
terms of service, please do not use the Service.
