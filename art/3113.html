"Ladies...I was like Dizzy all over again. What do you think?"

I also saw on Twitter this morning how they're pushing "You Get What You Give" for an Oscar nod...(at the top of the comments there's a long thread about how they don't deserve an Oscar nod). But...I do think it could find a way to earn one.

Also, I'm pretty sure we've seen this one before. I mean "Best Motion Picture. Animated" is a nod to "Shrek," but this year is "The Illusionist." I don't know what it'll be next year, but they've made it a tradition to be nominated.

The New York Film Critics Circle award was not without controversy. The film had the support of nearly every NY critic, except Mike D'Angelo. I think it's great that they didn't use their votes as the deciding factor for the award. The group is independent from the Oscars, and doesn't always agree. I heard someone say "Why did they give the award to Sweeney Todd, and not to The Hangover. It was better, and it wasn't nominated at the Oscars."

And that's a great point.

Like I said, the Academy loves them some "Sweeney Todd," even with the "award-winning acting."

Not only did "The Hangover" earn a Best Picture nomination, but it's also going to win the Razzies. (The Razzie for "Best Picture" went to "The Departed.") As if "The Hangover" didn't already stand out from the "Sesame Street" pack, it also snagged a Best Picture Nomination for Comedy from the Golden Raspberry Awards.

For those of you who have been waiting, here's what the New York Film Critics had to say:

Winner - The Descendants (Best Actor - George Clooney)
"It’s wonderful that Descendants got in. That was not expected."

"I really liked Shrek, but I have a question about it...I haven't seen Rango yet, but I feel like I'm seeing the same thing again. The animals are speaking Spanish and everything else. Isn't the movie set in Mexico? Wasn't that supposed to be one of the distinguishing qualities of this movie?"

- "Worst Picture:" "If I were to suggest that, it would be The Hangover, which was so bad that people just goofed off and ignored it" (Besson).

"I think it was probably a mistake not to have [Ben Stiller, Patricia Arquette, and Philip Baker Hall] nominate themselves for Worst Picture...This one isn’t necessarily any worse than Rango, but I certainly like J. Lo a lot more than I do in Rango. So I think they got the wrong year."

- "Worst Picture:" "You never want to see something like [Rango]. I find it incredibly painful to see, and I know that’s what the best bad movies were in the 1940s, the 1930s. All right, there’s nothing in it."

"I always want to see Shrek 4. I want to see Shrek 5. I don’t really care about [Shrek 5] or [Shrek:Birds] because they’re not doing those things. They’re trying to win over Middle America or whatever. All right, I don’t understand that. I know that’s what makes most money and everything else."

- "Worst Picture:" "I think [Rock of Ages] is supposed to be a silly kind of musical. I don’t see how that can be worst."

He did his magic right there.

It seems like he should have been nominated. His character was a bit over the top, but I feel like the rest of the movie was too. And he didn't have to say a lot. It wasn</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:13
