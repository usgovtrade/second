The traditional Christmas tree is displayed in the home or an entryway with the branches reaching above head level. A wide variety of ornaments and decorations are affixed to the branches to create a visually pleasing display. In some areas, a string of lights is wound around the tree to make the tree more visually appealing. The string of lights is typically arranged to alternate between two separate lighting circuits such that half of the lights are connected to one circuit and the other half of the lights are connected to a second circuit. The lights in each separate lighting circuit are often connected to a switch that controls the flow of current through the lighting circuits.
It would be desirable to provide improved lighting systems and methods for use in decorating a Christmas tree. Such systems may help create a more visually pleasing tree display. The lighting systems may utilize various types of lighting devices such as multicolored or colored LEDs to provide a brighter and more attractive tree display. In addition, such lighting systems may include components to help organize the wiring of such systems such that the lights can be used together in aesthetically pleasing ways.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:33
