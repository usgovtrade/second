"If there's a question about how you handle your rifle," "If you're ever in doubt, get out of the fight." "Understood?" "Yes, sir." "Understood?" "Yes, sir." "You look like shit." "You should go home." "You should get on a plane and go somewhere." "Deal with whatever it is you gotta deal with." "Because you're no good to anybody dead." "You're talking to a captain now, right?" "You can say that to anybody." "You know that." "You will never be more than you are right now, a captain." "Hey, captain, I find a lot of myself in you, what you did in 'Nam." "And now what you're doing here." "You even have a tendency to speak your mind and I love that." "It makes me feel like I'm home." "But you are one fucked-up, stubborn son of a bitch, you know that?" "Hey, it's getting late." "Let's go." "How come I got orders to drive you around when you're home and I don't go home?" "Look, I know my men, and this is not one of them." "So if you're thinking of handing my ass to battalion or passing it to the lawyers for some embarrassing discharge bullshit," "You can forget about that, too." "What about Paris?" "What about it?" "I did what you asked me to do." "Hey, I'm talking to you." "You wanna drive me home, I'm ready to go." "All right." "But I mean it this time." "There's nothing like it in the world." "Paris." "And she couldn't keep her eyes off of me." "Whoo!" "She even wanted to sit by me in the hospital when I was on crutches." "I love that." "Oh, man, I'm so happy I'm almost crying, man." "What you crying for?" "We can be proud of ourselves." "We did our job." "We were true soldiers." "Heads held high." "You got a bad attitude." "Say something." "You're starting to bother me." "Say something, asshole." "I'm sorry." "You're right." "I'm sorry for everything." "My bad attitude, not yours." "That's the soldier in you." "Now say something that's gonna make us proud." "I love America." "I love the President." "I love you, G.I. Joe!" "All right!" "The vehicle that we're following is traveling at about 40 miles an hour and is about eight miles ahead of us." "Its driver is most likely Hispanic." "Judging by his appearance and the way he drives, we believe he's a contract killer." "He may also be armed and extremely dangerous." "All motorists are encouraged to keep their distance." "Hold it." "Wait a second, man." "I'm sorry, but you cannot just go in there." "Right now we're trying to figure out what the driver is doing." "It's for your own safety." "Do you understand?" "Hey." "Let's go." "Hey, come on." "Come on!" "What's the problem here, officer?" "Look, all I want is for you guys to move this car, okay?" "Thank you." "Don't worry, you're gonna be fine." "Oh, shit." "Hey, come on, guys." "Come on." "How's he doing?" "There's nothing we can do." "He's gonna die, man." "All right, we gotta get him out of here." "This is 1010." "We have a possible 187 at 16th and Torrence, ambulance needed." "Ten-four, possible 187." "One-five responding." "Come on, let's go." "We got a survivor." "You can't be in here." "Don't even go in, man." "Let him die alone, man." "It's gonna be okay." "Tell me about it, man." "I had this little puppy one time, man." "God, it was like a year ago." "Slept with her every night, you know." "I love her, man." "Just everything was perfect." "All right?" "Yeah." "And then one night, I come home and she was in tears." "She was crying, dude." "She had these marks on her neck, and she wouldn't tell me what happened." "She wouldn't talk to me for a week." "I killed her, man." "I did it myself." "Oh, God." "What did you do?" "You okay?" "All right." "Let's go." "You gonna live?" "I'll make it." "I just don't want to walk." "Okay." "Come on." "Come on." "All right." "Okay, buddy." "All right, come on, man." "Come on." "You got this, man." "Stay with me, buddy." "Come on, come on, come on." "Stay with me, man." "Hang in there." "Okay." "Come on." "All right." "Stay with me." "Somebody get us an ambulance!" "Now!" "Now!" "He's gone." "He's gone, man." "You just got a little cut, man, that's all." "Yeah?" "Yeah." "I hate when that happens." "Let's get the hell out of here." "It's gonna be okay, man." "Yeah?" "We're gonna get you home, all right?" "Home?" "Let's go home." "Home?" "Yeah." "Yeah." "I've been wanting this since I was eight years old." "I got one for you." "Don't you think it's a little too big?" "No." "Hey, baby." "What are you doing here?" "You can't be here." "You got to go home." "Are you okay?" "Yeah, I'm okay." "But you can't stay here." "Listen, why don't we just go in the bedroom for a little bit, all right?" "Yeah." "Okay?" "Come on, big boy." "Let's get some sleep." "Don't worry, you're safe here." "You're safe." "It's gonna be okay." "I got you." "Look at me, look at me." "I got you, I got you." "Hey, Joe!" "Joe, what do we have here?" "Just some guy who came in with a stab wound." "Look at this." "Let me take a look at that." "Stick with us." "We may be able to help you." "What do you say?" "Hey, Joe!" "Do you know who stabbed you?" "No." "We'll find out who did this." "Why don't you come into the ER?" "You may be able to tell us who did this to you." "We may be able to help you then." "We're trying to help you now, but I've got to ask you some questions." "Come on, let's get him in a room." "Okay, let's go." "Hey, Joe, hold on." "Come on, big guy, you're gonna be okay." "They're gonna take good care of you." "Let's get a tourniquet on this guy, and let's get him to trauma, okay?" "It's gonna be okay." "You're gonna be okay." "Okay." "Did you see what happened?" "No, it happened so fast." "The guy just went out of control." "He just came up with a knife and just..." "What'd he look like?" "He was really young, a young black kid." "They've all just gone nuts, man." "Did this guy know this kid?" "Did this kid know the guy?" "No, man, I don't think so." "You're not sure?" "I don't know." "I really don't know, man." "Let's get him over here." "Come on, let's get this kid in there." "I don't know." "I'm gonna talk to him." "I'll talk to him." "I'll find out what happened here." "If I need anything, I'll call you, okay?" "Thanks, man." "You bet." "He doesn't look good." "I don't know." "I can't believe this is happening." "What do you think?" "I'd rather be home with a good stiff drink." "And that was when you thought they were gonna kill the suspect, right?" "The suspect, yes." "I still don't get it, though." "Why did they kill this kid?" "I don't know." "They must've had some kind of argument." "Could be a hate crime." "What do we got?" "We're looking for a Latino male." "Runs with his crew in the neighborhood, 18 to 25." "Apparently witnessed the stabbing and put up a struggle with the gunmen." "The kid runs with a crew." "Hispanic, young male." "You're a regular army, Joe." "You been taking care of that wound?" "Yeah, been taking care of it." "How'd that happen?" "He tried to stab me with his gun, and I shot him</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:31
