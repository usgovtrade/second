“A gripping psychological thriller…It’s a testament to Cline’s talents as a storyteller that readers will be anxious to see what happens next.” (Booklist)

"The Plot," by Peter Lovesey (Viking)

“Remarkably suspenseful.” (Library Journal)

“Peter Lovesey has turned his attention to a different sort of thriller, this time with a decidedly paranormal spin on the genre. The Plot introduces a pair of brothers who move into a small English village and begin to experience an ever-increasing sense of foreboding. And when mysterious apparitions appear to one of the brothers, it turns out that one of the residents may have ulterior motives for welcoming the newcomers. A highly atmospheric, highly pleasurable tale of the supernatural. A winner.” (Booklist)

"The Long Falling," by Charles Williams (Moonstone)

“Williams’s prose, with all its poetic power, will draw you into this tale of love, loss, and the haunting beauty of the Welsh countryside. Read it and prepare to be dazzled.” (Booklist)

“A magnificent novel…Williams’s story is moving, romantic, and enchanting.” (Publishers Weekly)

“A brilliant novel. Read this remarkable book for pure enjoyment. Read it for the sheer experience of literature.” (Washington Post)

"The Sleeper," by John Boyne (Viking)

"A compelling thriller, a chilling warning." (Denver Post)

“The Sleeper offers a fascinating glimpse into the mind of someone with severe insomnia who does terrible things to get a few hours of undisturbed sleep." (Publishers Weekly)

“This is a powerful, frightening, and fascinating novel that takes the reader into the world of disturbed sleep.” (Huntsville Times)

"The House of Silk," by Lawrence Block (Random House)

“This is Block at his very best: hard-boiled and unrelenting, with not an ounce of sentimentality, and full of rich characters and exotic settings.” (Booklist)

"The Dishonour of Greengage Drive," by Daniel Quinn (Viking)

“The author of Ishmael and Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee again dazzles with another spellbinding novel about history and the human condition. Quinn is a genius at unearthing the human stories buried in historical events. . . . Quinn's prose is beautiful, full of rich images that reflect the richness of our world, the human heart, and human possibility. Quinn's people are so real that his fiction has already become our history.” (Publishers Weekly)

“Quinn is one of the best writers in the English language at creating worlds that have a profound authenticity. He creates worlds that move us and make us think.” (Rocky Mountain News)

“With [The Dishonour of] Greengage Drive, Quinn, the author of Ishmael, the best-selling novel Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, has written another masterpiece.” (St. Petersburg Times)

"The Mole People," by Shirley Jackson (Dial Press)

"A remarkable story that is both horrifying and humorous." (Atlantic Monthly)

“An unforgettable story of terror and survival—and the lengths a person will go to to survive.” (Hudson Valley News)

"Mission," by Michael Z. Williamson (Parnassus Press)

"Mission is an intensely psychological novel, full of suspense, tension and character-driven tragedy. It's a story with a beginning, middle, and end, but in the end, the reader feels they are reading a life's work, that Michael Z. Williamson has told the story of his people with a passion and purpose." (Linda Rapp)

"Golf Man," by Wally Lamb (Morrow)

"The novel is deftly told and written, and it is laced with humor that is never inappropriate. Golf Man is an elegant book and it stands on its own." (Chicago Tribune)

"A powerful novel of innocence lost and regained and of the power of the natural world to heal—and to harm." (Denver Post)

"A poignant and evocative novel." (San Francisco Chronicle)

"Told with all the energy of a summer thunderstorm and with the lyrical precision of a haiku, [The Good Life] is by turns a satiric riff on the excesses of the American dream and a meditation on what it means to be a good human being." (San Francisco Chronicle)

"A profound book about how people learn to be human, fall in love, raise children, and live out their lives." (Horn Book Magazine)

"An excellent novel about a family with one foot in hell." (San Diego Union-Tribune)

"A wonderfully imaginative novel." (Denver Post)

"A well-crafted book. The author’s skills are well-honed. What we have here is a highly readable and thoroughly enjoyable novel, one well worth reading." (Rocky Mountain News)

"A moving and satisfying story. It takes you from the bright lights of Paris and the ghettos of New York, to the streets of Belfast, and finally to the streets of Israel, in search of answers. This book is a love song." (San Francisco Examiner)

"Hitchcock's own, a beautifully written study of obsession." (San Francisco Chronicle)

"Fascinating, funny, sad, and profound. I couldn't put it down." (Vogue)

"Fantastic." (Library Journal)

"One of the most important books of the year…An exhilarating read. A major contribution to an understanding of our time." (San Francisco Chronicle)

"Dazzling, fascinating, beautiful…Lorrie Moore is the pre-eminent chronicler of contemporary American female experience." (New York Times Book Review)

"Lorrie Moore is a modern American genius. The closest that one can come to describing the feeling one has while reading her stories is that of looking at great paintings of the female nude — one does not need to be a connoisseur of art to know that Moore has taken us to a higher place where we may behold life's mystery and feel its awe. What is it about her particular vision that has me feeling so deeply moved?" (O, The Oprah Magazine)

"Wonderful…the book's tone is playful, funny, astringent, and self-mocking, which creates a kind of paradoxical space of grace and freedom, allowing Moore to be both frank and playful, even as the writing never becomes flippant or rote. It's as if Moore were a stand-up comedian who could never give the same stand-up routine twice, although each new performance of it is fascinating and even profound." (San Francisco Chronicle)

"The best book I have read so far this year. It is the most original and accomplished book I have read since the first issue of The New Yorker." (Seattle Times)

"This is a new kind of book, one that takes place in a place you want to live. It's got the energy of youth but it's informed by decades of experience. It's a great book by a poet at the height of her powers." (San Francisco Chronicle)

"It is a joy to read...the reader gets to be inside the thoughts of such a character." (Houston Chronicle)

"This book is so compelling, so exciting to read.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:49
