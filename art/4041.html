The first Gundam show aired on December 17, 1979 and followed a group of students at Tanno Academy during the Zeta war. The students, known as the Gundam pilots, use mobile suits, war machines from space, to fight against aliens who are invading Earth. A pilot, named Amuro Ray, falls in love with a girl named Mikazuki. When the war is over, he is chosen to be the representative of a new breed of people, called "Newtypes," who are supposed to lead the rest of humanity. For this reason, he decides to stay on Earth and marry Mikazuki.

A new kind of war begins at around 2000 and the story follows the second generation of children, the Foster's Children, as they fight against an ancient alien race known as the Zakus.

Another generation of children is born and they are the Sixteen Years of Nils Christians, the descendants of those who were involved in the first war. The children go to a school and the most popular child, Nils Chritian, battles with the Zakus.

The war resumes in 2023 with the same goal as before: to capture Gundam and destroy it. They finally succeed in this goal but in the process, they realize they must make a compromise.

The story of Mobile Suit Gundam, the anime of giant robots that aired between 1979 and 1996, is the origin of a franchise which includes manga, books, movies, and the latest Universal Century Gundam video games. There are many things that make this series stand out from the crowd, but our favorite is probably that it is the origin of the franchise.

After this, it will launch the Mobile Suit Gundam and Gunpla series that would span over 4 decades and continue to this day.

This series is one of the most popular franchises in all of anime and is loved by fans everywhere. It has one of the most popular Gunpla (plastic model kits) in Japan, Gundam Hobby, and has its own theme park. It is not hard to see why it's called Gundam Hobby.

Mobile Suit Gundam: The First Gundam Series (1979)

Gundam (pronounced guh-dan) is a name which is given to robots that are made by the people of the planet Homs.

These robots are made to help people during wars. In our story, it starts with the war of the Zaks in the year 2000.

The original Gundam is a gigantic robot made by Celestial Being, a company made up of the children of the Six Millionaires of Japan.

This gigantic robot, Gundam, is sent by Celestial Being to stop the humans from finding out their secret, but Amuro and the others find out it is still in working condition and repair it.

Amuro: But I guess it's true that if the opponent possesses a Gundam, you'll lose even if you've won.

In the original series, it had only 2 episodes but here you can see the other episodes with more than 80 action-packed minutes of mind-blowing scenes.


The first Gundam anime started in the year 1979, and it was broadcasted on Japanese television, with a total of 50 episodes, 2 specials, and 2 movies. This was the first series that involved Zakus. Gundam is a race in the future that fights against an evil alien species. The alien life form has a strange desire: it wants to create a new breed of humans. You can see their evil plan in this picture:

Gundam is one of the oldest Gundam series. It is considered a classic that started the Gundam franchise.

Gundam 0080 (1986)

Many people love the Gundam 00 series, also known as the Second Generation series because they begin the series with Char's Counterattack. This is a Gundam series that features mobile suits that take action against aliens called the Zakus. Char's Counterattack is the first episode, and in this show the audience will learn the story of Char, the grandson of Amuro Ray, and how he is reborn in the Gundam series.

The Gundam 0080 series is considered one of the best because it combines action and comedy in one Gundam series. For fans of Gundam, it is the best Gundam series to date.
