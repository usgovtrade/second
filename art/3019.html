Taiwan is one of the main global suppliers of raw materials, components, parts and semi-manufactured products to the electronics industry, and is also a major export-oriented manufacturer of electronic components.

An efficient supply chain with reliable, high-quality trade secrets is a prerequisite for this global economic powerhouse. The Taiwanese electronics industry is currently producing more than 30 million electronic and electrical components for the world’s telecommunications, military, industrial, IT, aerospace and consumer markets. The demand for Taiwanese components and products in these sectors is growing continuously.

Sourcing from China for Electronics Trade Secrets

China’s rapid economic development, huge market opportunities and lower production costs have attracted many manufacturers to relocate their production facilities there. The world’s electronics supply chain has thus been greatly impacted by the influx of low-cost, low-value electronic products into global markets from China. A variety of components are fabricated in China and are then imported to Taiwan for assembly and testing before being re-exported to final-stage markets. Therefore, Taiwan now competes on both the manufacturing and sourcing sides of the supply chain.

Managing trade secrets and other valuable resources is therefore of strategic importance for companies trading in the electronics sector.

Our Taiwanese manufacturers of electronic components therefore require the confidentiality of both their trade secrets and product designs. Due to the large scale of the business and the tight relationships with their partners, confidentiality is critical to Taiwanese manufacturers.

As such, our manufacturers require a high degree of security with electronic access restricted to authorised employees with the utmost care to be taken with the transfer of physical trade secrets. For this reason, we work closely with a number of manufacturers to implement trade secret management systems with state-of-the-art firewall technology.

With an established trade secret management system, including an efficient production flow, we guarantee product quality while ensuring a high level of security with our extensive experience in the sector.

Electronic Sourcing in Taiwan

Taiwan produces more than 70 percent of the world’s LCD panels and more than 80 percent of semiconductors in its semiconductor manufacturing sector. For the electronics supply chain, electronic products made in Taiwan are considered to be high-quality, high-value products.

However, the current situation is that Taiwan is a net importer of components and raw materials. The need for greater import volumes, however, will eventually lead to increased pressure to transfer trade secrets to lower value countries such as China, the Philippines and Thailand. At this point, trade secrets will leak, which will have a negative impact on product quality and lead to financial losses for companies that previously enjoyed the confidence of their customers.

The best way to ensure high product quality and the confidential nature of trade secrets is to work closely with manufacturers of reputable Taiwanese electronics companies.

We provide a full range of high-value electronics product design, development and manufacturing services. We have been successful in retaining manufacturing operations on the Taiwanese mainland, and successfully expanded by offering global services to multinational clients in other countries.

Our expertise enables us to design, develop and test products for global electronics giants.

We are committed to working with our clients to develop high-quality products and protect proprietary intellectual property. Our Taiwanese manufacturing partners in the electronics sector ensure the design and development of electronics products meet global standards in quality, reliability and innovation, while ensuring security of data.

We protect trade secrets, while retaining an intimate knowledge of the sector to help our clients become future industry leaders. We also understand the issues facing the growing electronics sector and can assist clients through market entry and sales.
