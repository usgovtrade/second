The bun was a little too hard for me, and I preferred the patty without the cheese (despite a friend's recommendation to do the opposite, as she did), but this was something truly original that I can't wait to try again.

I'm all for a burger done "the way it used to be," so I had some mixed feelings about it when I went there to see if the place was still doing it. But, surprisingly, it is. I tried it on two visits. I wasn't impressed the first time around, and my friends didn't like it, either. But on my second trip, the burger came out looking like a patty of hand-formed beef and the cheese bubbled on top just like I'd had in my head when I had "Tastes Like Chicken." When I first tried it, the bun seemed a little too hard, but the next time around it was softer and more to my liking. The toppings were all good, too. I like that the hamburger is served with pickles (and you get them all if you order it "Lite," too). I enjoyed the fries, too, which I've always enjoyed.

As for the rest of the food on the menu, there's pretty much what you'd expect. It's a standard burger joint in our town. The other burgers, for example, are served with lettuce, tomato, and onion, as the standard burger should be. But the "Tastes Like Chicken" patty looks and tastes very much like a real hamburger patty, so if you're in a pinch and can't find a place that's doing it right, you'll be in pretty good shape. For me, the restaurant is OK, but I'm just glad it's there and I can get a tasty burger that I can identify as a burger, even if it's not the real thing. I don't mind the lack of veggies, because these are the standards of burgers, and I can't fault them for following the norm. I can, however, fault them for the bun being a little too hard. My sandwich, like my burger, was slightly soggy due to the cheese on top melting. That's okay. I would've liked it to be slightly crispy but I don't have much to complain about. Everything else was very good.

As a veggie I have always had a hard time finding vegetarian hamburgers that pass my taste buds muster. When I went to my local Subway (which is one of my only options in the area), I noticed that they were putting onions on my bun. This made me curious, and since my sub shop is my only option in town, I took a leap of faith and asked them if they had a burger without onion on it. They told me they did and they were good. I ordered it without onion and they gave it to me. It didn't taste like a hamburger, it tasted like onions. After this experience, I decided I would not waste my time with this establishment if I didn't like my burger as a veggie.

When I went back to my sub shop a couple days later, I just asked if they had a veggie burger without onions on it. They said they did, and again I ordered it. When it came, it had no onion on it, but the taste was terrible. I decided to take matters into my own hands and decided to take the burger home and cook it for myself.

I did some research on a veggie burger, and I decided that I wanted something that was real close to a beef burger so that it wouldn't taste too strong. I also found out that they can be kinda hit or miss, depending on how well the burger is prepared and what else you add to it.

My burgers, even though I couldn't find veggies in them, had the right consistency to them and the added cheese took away from the bad aftertaste of the veggie burger, so I was happy. It was very close to the real deal, but not perfect, because it didn't have any veggies in it, but the great taste of beef with cheese saved me from myself. I was happy that I could add some good tasting ingredients to this meal that I can't find at Subway, but I'm sad to say that I can no longer go there. I'll always prefer my veggie burgers to real burgers, so the restaurant had nothing to worry about if it didn't have that in it.

As a vegan, I often find myself going to many places in town just to get a veggie burger, and in so doing, I can say with confidence that this place offers the best tasting veggie burger around. And that's a well-deserved title, as they serve a decent size burger with grilled pineapple on top, a vegan-safe cheddar cheese and a bun so good you won't miss the beef.

I was just as hungry as all get out. My daughter was driving me around all over town for work and she would get to see me at dinner. I am not someone who likes to settle for less, but I do like to be somewhat reasonable. She would drive around and look at places, but I was all up for burgers, so when we came up to this place, I thought it would be a perfect win for me. I decided to get a veggie burger and was so glad I did, it was the best burger of my life. The texture of the burger is a bit off as well as some of the bread, but it was the best veggie burger. It was more of a patty than a burger and it made me so happy to find out they even do them. For that I give them five stars. I have had nothing but great things from this place. If you have a burger craving, you will find that this is one of the best places in town.

I have gone to this place many times now. For one thing, the burgers are excellent, and for another, the owner, Linda, is just a great person who really enjoys helping out the community. She is always on hand, not only to say hello, but to lend a hand when anyone wants some of her delicious veggie burgers. Linda also makes the best baked beans in the county!

We never really had a choice, since this was the only vegetarian restaurant that I was aware of, but they had some burgers that were interesting. The burger that I had to eat while in the area was a great one. It was cooked just right and had a bit of zing to it. The only thing that was missing was the cheese I would have preferred, but the veggies were very good and the bun was nice and soft.

I love veggie burgers and have written about my favorites on this site, but I have never had a vegetarian restaurant that I really, really liked. But this place is that place. Their regular menu is a collection of excellent vegetarian meals (including the one I had at the restaurant). But they also have vegan selections (I found their vegan burger to be a little more soggy than their regular burgers).

I didn't expect to like their menu, but I have already written about some of the vegetarian food that I had at the restaurant. What is important to me is that the veggie burger I tried tasted very much like a meat burger. It wasn't overpowered by the veggies, but if you ordered it without the cheese, you were basically eating a meat burger with some of the elements of a vegetarian burger. This would make a perfect vegan burger, and that is exactly how I treated it. I didn't know if I would like the burger since I usually prefer the taste of meat over</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:45
