How you gonna tell me to walk after you've already told me to crawl.

What are you talking about I haven't been posting in this thread for about an hour.

LOL

And this is why I cant even call a guy out. All I've been saying is you can't walk around with all this cash. Then you take a girl in for sex. Then you leave her alone and walk around with all that money and then tell me to crawl?

I know why this is funny to you. However in my mind you're being just as dirty minded as the next guy. The only difference I can find is you can't speak/think/act like this in real life. You hide it well, but it's there. And from what I've been told by others about you, its a trait that makes sense.

How is this dirty minded? I've already been told that I have no credibility to tell someone to be dirty minded. What do you expect me to do?

I have credibility. Dude. My "reputation" is very close to me.

Just let it go.

I am letting it go, I dont care. You were doing this for the past hour.

This is just as bad as the dude who thinks he's the first person to point out that girls in your area "are always on their periods".

I have no idea what the guy is talking about. Thats the funniest thing I've heard from that post.

What if I was calling you out for having a dirty minded attitude, would you be letting it go? Nope, not trying to turn this into an argument or anything, but its a pretty funny conversation.

LMAO

No, not trying to turn this into an argument either. I just don't understand why when I say it's funny that this person would be calling it dirty minded.

I wasn't trying to. I was making a joke and getting off on the irony of it. Do you really feel I'm making the same mistake twice? I'm not getting off on anything here, I'm just telling you the truth, and it's funny to me that a guy with a huge list of "dont cares" thinks that I would say something like this.

I think your trying to take something that I say and make it look wrong. Well I got news for you, I don't have dirty mind. Maybe that is the irony. But I know people are going to read your words and not give a dang about whether I said it or not, it's all about you know, what you did, and that's it. So if I got to choose, I'll take being called out on my word over dirty minded.

I still don't understand the whole "dirty minded" thing though, maybe this is the funniest thing to come out of your mouth in a long time, you are right.

i dont even understand what your trying to say

What am I trying to say, I am trying to say you have a lot of dicks riding on this argument that I do not see, but I can pretty much tell you are taking it way overboard.

What am I trying to say? I'm not sure if you were joking or not, so I will tell you I don't think you were. I think you are a complete idiot. I'm just a poor fool who makes jokes. I can't tell you if you are a complete idiot because you don't post that often. You spend the most time talking about how many "dicks" your comments are sucking. LOL I just really don't understand why you think it's "funny" when I say a guy has a dirty minded attitude, because to me, it's not "funny" as such, but it doesn't make sense. If I had a dirty minded attitude I wouldn't say the things I do about being clean minded, so I could never take that as a jab.

I'll tell you, if you go to my profile you will see that I do not think all the girls in my area are on their periods, so if I even said that you would be absolutely correct.

In what capacity do you want me to "take it overboard"? Do you want to know the truth? Do you want to say what you say knowing I will take it overboard, or do you just want to take it overboard because you think it will make you look good? I've got news for you, I think it looks bad. I think it looks like you were the one who couldn't take the loss. I don't know why you even came back.

So there you have it. This is a completely pointless conversation that no one cares about. I feel this is the worst thing I've ever written on an "off topic" type message. It really is. The only difference is that you can't just go around calling someone "dirt mind" for a whole hour, it would seem.

There is some things that are just fun. A simple conversation between people who are friends.

This is not a thing that I'm going to pretend that it doesn't exist.

Are you trying to tell me that you've been making fun of me when you come back and post a stupid sentence like that? I do not like that people are making fun of me and I am not a stupid person.

I didn't even have the intention to make fun of you in my mind. I'm not in the mind of that many guys out there. But as I said, I think you would really feel better if you took this conversation off.

If I was trying to tell you I was making fun of you, then I would be making fun of you. I'm not in your head. But if you feel that I was making fun of you then you need to realize that I was not.

All you need to do is understand that I am not making fun of you at all.

I am trying to get away from the arguing and come up with a nice solution so you can feel better.

I don't even know how that got started. I guess I just didn't like the fact that you went away for half an hour, and when I came back and you had made another thread that I didn't even care about you were being a dick. That's what I thought.

LOL, it wasn't a thread. I didn't even know the conversation was still going until I came back and saw that you had made another thread.

There are more threads going right now than I've ever seen before. I thought it was spam and it was taking so much time I thought it was spam. LOL

But I'm glad you got out your computer to look it up in the dictionary that nothing I say is making fun of you.

This is just my opinion and I will keep it to myself. If you are still in your head, then this is the last time I will tell you this.

Dude, you obviously hate me right now, and this has been going on for awhile now. If you don't understand what it is I'm trying to say then I don't know how you will ever take it overboard.

As it stands, I just don't see how it's funny to you. Maybe we are both off in our heads about this whole "thing", but if you are, you don't seem to be the best judge of what you think is funny.

If you actually believe that I called you a name then you are really really fucking stupid and an idiot.

And so it goes.

LMAO

As if you say "if you actually believe that I called you a name then you are really really fucking stupid and an idiot" doesn't make me see that you are indeed really really fucking stupid and an idiot.

This is what I thought.

LOL

Are you a complete idiot?

Is what you believe makes you a complete idiot. Is calling people in their heads an idiot for believing you are calling them an idiot just makes you "really really fucking stupid" or is it funny that you called someone an idiot?

Does it not make you feel like they may be a complete idiot when you call people in their heads "Idiot", especially in all caps? That's the thought in my head, but I could be wrong. It's a shame that you've been calling me a name for a year and half now. Then again, maybe you are just that desperate to convince people of something because you are really stupid.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:51
