Creating an AngularJS App in Visual Studio 2017

I want to create a sample Angular JS Application in Visual Studio 2017.
I tried to install Angular JS, angular-cli, and create a basic project but it always give me a error. 
error screenshot: 

A:

You need to run npm install --global @angular/cli@latest.
In Visual Studio: Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > Web Package management > External Web Tools
Set Update package on build to Always (the default)
Type searchterm and search for the correct version of the Angular cli.
Type @angular/cli and find the version you are using in Step 1.
Hit OK to download and install.

(I tried setting this up using the instructions from the ng help docs and could not get it to work.  The above worked for me on a brand new Angular CLI based project.)

A:

You just need to install the Angular cli globally. In order to do that, do the following.
npm install -g @angular/cli

This will take some time, but afterwards, it will be available globally.

A:

I'm using Visual Studio 2017 update 5.2.1 (latest stable) and i've found some weird configuration issue that's been going on for some time. I have tried uninstalling and installing a dozen different times. The issue I've found that's never worked was this (I have tried different versions of angular globally as well):
ng add angular-cli

I finally installed global version of Node.js and it worked. But I can't find a way to make npm work globally for me. It gives me "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\Web Tools\External\ npm"

I am using TypeScript because I can't get Angular-cli to work.

Visual Studio 2019 v16.3.5

I have used the instructions here to get Angular-cli working (thanks @hildychase's answer).

I have been trying to get Angular-cli to work with Visual Studio 2015 all day yesterday and i've came across this thread. There have been various solutions to this, none of which have worked for me. I will be happy to post my Visual Studio config when i have the time, but right now it is 1am and I need to finish my work.

I hope that this is helpful for other people with the same problem.

A:

I am in the same boat and I found a solution that works for me.
Visual Studio Team Tools (ext)
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher.vscode-angular-5.1.1
Install the following extension inside Visual Studio and when prompted for a key, leave the current key blank. This will resolve the dependency issue.

Once that is done, create a brand new Angular 5 project by running this in the command prompt: ng new MyAngular5App

Reference this Angular 5 template from Visual Studio:
Tools > Extensions and Updates > Visual Studio Gallery
or
Tools > Extensions and Updates > Online Gallery

Reference this Angular CLI: 
Tools > NuGet Packages > Package Manager > Manage Packages for Solution

Use this Angular CLI:
ng set newApp1@1.0.0
ng new @angular/cli my-new-app

Finally, you should be able to configure your app as follows:
{
  "name": "my-app-1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json",
    "build": "ng build --base-href /newApp1/",
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint",
    "e2e": "ng e2e"
  },
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@angular/animations": "^5.1.1",
    "@angular/common": "^5.1.1",
