I don't want any trouble at the church."

Dex nodded. "You should have more faith in your security staff. All right, I'll let them know you want them at the church."

"They've put extra men there already."

"Well, if they're already there, you can relax," Dex said. "This has been my understanding, but just to be certain, I'll call the church myself."

I sighed. "Look, Dex, please. I am more than willing to give these guys whatever help I can. They're all still grieving. They are just going to be more careful than ever about security. We all are."

"All right, we can work together on this. Tell your guys to put in a couple extra hours at the church, on Sunday. I'll have someone there. He'll have to be discreet."

"You think that's going to help?"

"We don't know enough about the killers, but we know we want them and we want to find them. Let's get those guys up here, first thing in the morning. If we can get one or two of them, we'll be off to a good start."

"I'm not going to like this," I said.

"That's all right. You won't have to. This is going to be handled quietly, with some discretion."

"But don't you see? If this gets out, it's going to raise all sorts of suspicions. What are we going to do about security here in Chicago? This might be the tip of the iceberg."

Dex shook his head. "We'll put people on this right away. But as far as anyone is concerned, it's just you and me, and we won't get anybody anywhere with any real names or phone numbers."

I stared at him. I saw no reason to doubt that Dex had his own way of going about business. I wasn't happy, but I did agree that it was far better to keep it quiet.

"You going to be all right?" he asked me. "You sure?"

"I'm sure," I said. "And I'm not worried about this. We'll see how it goes. If we can get the killers, this is one crisis down, right?"

"One down, anyway," Dex said. "What about our mystery guest?"

"You keep your cell phone on you? You know what, let me call you."

Dex nodded. "Go ahead."

I grabbed a chair and brought it to his desk. Then I sat in front of him. He handed me his phone and dialed the number. It was ringing before I could get my finger to the receive button. I pressed and got through. It was a woman's voice.

"Hello."

"Hi. Is your husband home?"

"No."

"You'll forgive my saying, but I don't think you're home."

"Yes."

"Okay. Well, he's not here, either. I can let him know you called, if you want."

"Oh, no. Thanks anyway. I didn't have a phone number for you, in case he called."

"It's okay. This is his business line, too."

"Okay."

"He could call any time."

"Okay."

Dex was nodding. He was still calling and getting good reception, even though I couldn't hear anything but the clicks. The woman's voice sounded like her husband's. Dex was nodding at me as he spoke.

"Do you have his beeper number?"

"You're his superior. You can call him anytime."

"Yeah, I could, but I don't know his beeper number. Do you have it handy?"

"I could check for you."

"Do that. And give it to me. It's very important."

She laughed. "Why don't you call him? He just left the office."

"I don't have his number. Do you mind if I use your phone?"

"Be my guest. Sorry for bothering you. He should be home any minute."

Dex thanked her and hung up. "She got the beeper number," he said. "We have one hour."

"Why are we hurrying?"

"She's going to call him at home and give him the number."

"And then he'll go to your office and check with you."

"Probably. Or he might leave it alone."

"Why would he do that?"

"I don't know. There's always a first time."

I shook my head. "I think we should assume that he's going to go through with it. He'll be here as soon as he can."

Dex nodded. "Then we better get the team together, don't you think?"

"Absolutely."

"You think he'll go right now?"

"I don't know, but I think he'll go tomorrow. If it were me, I wouldn't bother with surveillance or security at the office, but I might want to check with other people who are close to this. Then I'd know who was involved and not involved. He'll be thinking about that. You can bet on it."

Dex shook his head. "He's going to get here as soon as he can."

I nodded. "Yes. Sooner rather than later."

The meeting at my apartment was tense. It was a cold, raw day and we sat in my living room, with doors to my bedroom shut. Dex was there with the rest of the Chicago Team, and some of the men on the day shift, but it was just as well to avoid being together with other people. There was talk, but no one seemed to know anything about what I should do, so we sat in silence. I felt like I was on the side of a cliff and the only thing I could do was wait for the wind to howl louder. It was so quiet that the dogs got up and walked around.

Someone pounded on the door and I went to answer it. It was a police officer. "Mr. Kenzie?"

"Yes?"

"My name is Jim O'Shea. I'm a patrolman with the Cicero Police Department."

"That's right."

"There's been an attempted break-in at the church."

"At the church?"

"Yes."

I felt like he had slapped me in the face. "But I didn't call the police. I talked with the chief of police at five."

"Maybe the desk officer didn't get your message."

"It was on our caller ID. No one bothered to call back, though. Just sent me a note, after the guy left here."

"No phone calls?"

"No."

"Mr. Kenzie?"

"What?"

"Have you been in today?"

"Yes."

"Did you see anyone today who you might have seen before?"

I shook my head. "No."

"They may have seen you. It's just a precaution. We're just not sure."

I felt like I had been knocked over by a bolt of lightning. I was trembling as I stood in front of the doorway to my house, holding the door open. I didn't like the feeling of being watched. I tried to take deep breaths, but that just made me feel like I was getting sucked back in, being drawn into the void, back to the nothing, back to being alone and afraid and vulnerable. I took some shallow breaths, but that wasn't enough.

Dex came from the dining room, where he had been playing on the internet and reading the paper. I knew he would know this feeling. Dex saw it in my face and the way I was trembling, and the look on my face.

"I saw him," Dex said.

"Who?"

"The guy who shot your father."

I nodded. "Did you tell the police?"

"I don't want to get into trouble."

"You told them?"

"Of course I told them. I'll talk to them again tomorrow. If he comes back."

"You think he will?"

"I'm not going to sit in a darkened doorway."

"Why did they check the caller ID?" I asked. "Why not just call back my room?"

"If we didn't know who had called in before, we wanted to make sure. We have to check everything. The minute you went away, we checked, and saw that no one had called you back. We just wanted to make sure."

"What about surveillance?"

Dex sighed. "They're not looking for surveillance. We had them watch the area as a precaution. We thought we had a guy in there, and this might be him coming out to get something to eat or look for a phone. We don't want to let him make contact, but I don't want to spook him, either."

"How many men are you going to have on the church?"
