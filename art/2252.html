The holidays can be expensive, which means you should probably be looking at a lot of gift guides. When you’re time poor, don’t spend time looking at a bunch of posts asking what to get for that hard-to-shop-for friend, coworker, or colleague? We found 10 great gift ideas that are just right for the guy who wears more hats than most people wear shoes.

This tool was created for you – to make sure you get the gear that will allow you to get the most out of your gear. You need more than just one jacket for a winter outing. And, it’s even more important to have a rain jacket to keep you dry when the weather turns bad.

As a bonus: these products come with warranties from the company that invented them, which means they’re guaranteed to keep you warm and dry for many adventures to come.

These gloves will not only help keep your hands warm, but they have a special touch for him. He’ll get a kick out of having these hands-free gloves to wear. So, don’t just hand him these gift guides, hand him a gift that will make his day.

A simple watch with a big heart is enough to make this guy’s heart beat faster. If he is a fan of a few different video games and wears many hats in his line of work, we recommend a wireless game controller so he can easily keep track of all the on-screen action.

A small, but effective watch is a nice way to keep him on schedule and aware of the time – especially when he’s meeting people or running late for a meeting.

A nice gift for the guy who has lots of things on his mind is a device that has three distinct modes: audio, vibrate, and silent. With this device, you’ll be sure to hear a message from him even if he’s in the next town over.

A simple and clever gadget is a cool way to take a phone call without having to carry around his smartphone. Keep it by his bedside table and he’ll know you’re thinking about him even when he isn’t sitting next to his phone.

For the guy who is always on-the-go, one of these three options is a smart way to stay organized. Each of these choices has multiple colors and sizes to make sure he always has what he needs to stay productive and happy – plus he’ll get a laugh out of the different styles.

This is a nice book of sayings for the guy who loves to read and write jokes. It’s also a great gift for him who has a lot of humor. It can be used for office gifts and it can be purchased as a gift book.

For the guy who likes to learn and grow, we recommend getting him one of these cool books that has an assortment of tips and tricks that can help him grow as a person and a professional. The book looks great on his desk and he’ll enjoy having it out on the coffee table to browse.

For the guy who spends a lot of time working from a home office, a quality mug is a gift that he can use every day. This mug is large enough to hold his hot cup of coffee in style, but also sturdy enough to stand up to the abuse that he’ll probably be giving it during his busy day.

For the guy who spends hours working on the laptop, we recommend this amazing keyboard that will improve his typing speed and accuracy. The keypad is an extra feature that’s designed to help him focus on the text and notes that he creates.

For the guy who’s going to go running, we recommend a breathable shirt made from synthetic material so he doesn’t have to worry about the odor of his clothing after he has an extensive run. The shirt will also provide him with a little more warmth so he doesn’t have to wear a heavy jacket.

A gift for him that he’ll really enjoy is a hat that has a little built-in storage. The pockets make it easy for him to keep his wallet, keys, and phone in one place. The hat is also waterproof so he doesn’t have to take the hat off when he takes a shower.

This mini backpack can fit in a backpack or even his gym bag. And, it has multiple pockets for quick access to his important belongings. He can even wear it with a T-shirt, which means it will match pretty much everything he owns.

There you have it – a list of 10 gifts that every guy would appreciate. They’re gifts that will make his life a little bit easier, or happier, or just plain better. He’s going to be impressed when he opens the boxes that you purchase these items in and you’ll be satisfied knowing that you chose the right gift for him.

We’ve made your life a lot easier by providing this list of gift ideas for the man in your life. When shopping, be sure to look for the store’s return policy before you buy. You never want to give a gift that he can’t enjoy.
