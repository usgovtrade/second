Yes I agree. The problem of putting the qtest in a 'utility' directory is
that the QEMU binary itself is built with this utility and have all the
utility as its dependency. This would lead to very awkward situations
since qtest is more and more useful and becoming the standard QEMU testing
framework.

Thierry.

Okay then, it seems to be a consensus :-)

Actually not, since I noticed that the qtest command already exists in
QEMU's utilities, and I think that would be okay to leave it like that.
And also since I just added a few useful features like -m and -s.

Okay, I agree. I guess that would be fine.
Thanks for your contribution!

I'm really glad that you don't oppose too much on my changes :-)
I also wrote to some minor improvements and fixed some typo.
On Sunday, I fixed all the file/dir names so they don't mix up with
QEMU's file/dir names.
The main features left is adding all the tests provided by test_*.c and
adding a main loop in qtest.
