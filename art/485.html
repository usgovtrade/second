planning on joining this club." "I already have." "That was quick." "Now what 
are you going to do to save money?" "Already having my money saved up."
"Tiffany, just what I always tell you... the more you talk, the less you 
make." "You are so mean." "You, as usual, don't have a clue what I'm talking 
about." "But I do." "What?" "I said, I already have my money saved up." 
"I meant your money for our trip." "What?" "I said, I am so going to kill you 
when we get back from our trip." "You are so going to wish you hadn't said 
that." "And I'll keep my promise."

It was only a matter of time before someone called my bluff... and by God... 
it was going to be Kyle.

I'll say this, that boy can go all night. Even when he's asleep, he can get 
it up. I'm talking no sleep sex. He had sex in his sleep. And he made me do 
it. But he was a really great lover. You never felt like he was going to 
judge you for how long it took or if you came, it was always, "What does it 
feel like to you?" "Where do you like it?" "What are you in the mood for?" "I 
am your master tonight. You are going to obey my every whim. Go for as long 
as you want, be as loud as you want, you'll cum when I want you to cum and 
only then will you have the privilege of going to sleep. I've just turned you 
into my slave to serve my every need and command. And you like it." "Master?" 
"Yes?" "Will you stay with me forever?" "I will always be with you." "And I 
will be here to serve you forever." "Oh. God. Yes. Thank you master." "I am 
your master. Say it." "I'm your master." "Kiss me." "I will serve you." 
"Will you always worship my cock?" "Yes." "Say it." "I'll worship your cock." 
"Worship my cock, worship my cock, worship my cock."

And he woke me up.

Fucking dreams.


Love Always,
Brian

P.S. By the way... he's in the living room. Go say hi.
