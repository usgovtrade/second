# Introduction

No matter if you live in a city, suburb, or rural area, you can find yourself in the uncomfortable position of being stuck in the house, unable to go anywhere because your car won't start.

While one type of problem may be the result of bad weather, another type of problem could be the result of neglecting to properly maintain your battery and knowing when to have it replaced. Battery-related problems are one of the most frequent reasons why vehicles won't start, so make sure you don't have your battery in bad shape.

# Chapter One

## Understanding Your Battery

The battery in your car is an electrochemical cell. Its main purpose is to make a chemical reaction that causes an electrical current that can power your vehicle. Your car needs electrical current to start the engine, power the ignition, run the starter, run the electrical devices and accessories, operate the lights, and run the cooling system.

**Figure 1-1:** Battery cells

Some batteries also store power so that if your car is not in use for a period of time and your car battery goes flat, you can use it as an emergency power supply for a small device to give you juice.

# Batteries and Alkalines

All batteries use a variety of chemicals called _electrolytes_ to create an electrochemical reaction that creates the chemical energy that makes your car move. In order for your battery to work, a chemical reaction must take place inside the battery. If a chemical reaction is not occurring inside your battery, the battery is dead.

Electrolytes are stored in two types of containers inside the battery:

  * The positive plates of the battery are sealed inside the battery using a solution of distilled water and salts of the _alkali metal_ (common examples are lithium, potassium, sodium, and calcium). Alkalines are called this because they give up a hydrogen ion (H) when they are reacted with water to create an alkaline salt, such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH).
  ̈ 
  * The negative plates of the battery are sealed inside the battery using a solution of salt (sodium, potassium, or lithium) dissolved in distilled water.

Batteries using salt (sodium, potassium, or lithium) dissolved in distilled water as an electrolyte have an anode, which is a positive pole and a cathode, which is a negative pole. Salt is a solute; that is, a dissolved substance in the solution. When you have a positive and negative electrode, you have an _electrochemical cell_.

Inside the battery, each type of electrolyte is isolated from the other type. This means there is no electrical connection between the positive and negative poles of the battery, but there is an electrical connection between the parts of the battery near the positive and negative sides. This is illustrated in Figure 1-2.

**Figure 1-2:** The battery's electrolyte is isolated by being contained in two different containers.

### Dangers of Batteries

Like all batteries, the ones in your car are powerful and potentially dangerous if not handled correctly. Many batteries are highly toxic and create serious hazards if a short circuit is created in them. This can create a huge fire, resulting in damage to your vehicle and any nearby people or property.

If your battery has not been checked by a professional and replaced when the time comes, a lot of damage may be caused. This damage could make your car useless.

If you have to jump start your vehicle, having a battery that is not fully charged can also be very dangerous. If a battery is not fully charged, the jump start could damage the battery.

### Batteries: How They Work

There are two types of batteries: rechargeable and nonrechargeable. Rechargeable batteries can be recharged or reused, while nonrechargeable batteries are usually thrown away when they are used up and replaced with a new one.
