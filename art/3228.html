Some states have begun to take measures to put a halt to the illegal transfer of money through prisons by prisoners. This is one example of a prison system working to the benefit of the population.

#### **Rapid Implementation**

##### **_Advantages_**

• It could not have been implemented quickly or effectively unless initiated by a prison administration.

• The ability to control the movement of money inside the prison system will be an administrative control.

• Once implemented, most likely in this current administration's final year, it will be difficult to reverse.

##### **_Disadvantages_**

• There may be some resistance from those affected, so they may not cooperate in an attempt to "hide" funds.

• It may not be successful, or there may be ways around it.

#### **Other Issues**

**Money Laundering**. Another concern to any prison administration is the transfer of illicit drug monies by prisoners. Because of the "stash" of cash, drugs, and valuables available, cash could be used to hide the "criminal" financial activity of drug dealers, who work within the system. This is not a new problem, but the ability to track these cash transfers will definitely be one step closer to reducing some of this action.

**Correctional Officer Pocket Change**. As of this writing, one correctional officer is facing federal charges for allegedly accepting bribes in exchange for turning a blind eye when contraband entered prison. This has caused the issue of officer pocket change to rise to a new level of concern. The money involved may or may not be illegal depending on the facts of the case. However, keeping such cash inside a prison has always been fraught with danger. If discovered, prison staff could be accused of the same crimes, so the potential for an internal investigation becomes problematic.

This issue is not limited to one prison and can affect all agencies. The point is that the administration needs to be diligent in tracking the activities of each staff member and the methods by which he or she collects and spends money in the prison. An outside source has to be scrutinized closely because of his or her possible ties to prisoners.

### **Cash In, Cash Out**

If the prison administration is careful with its implementation, it will be able to make this practice illegal with little damage to the prisons, at least those using the method that involves inmate workers.

One simple thing that a correctional institution can do is review all transactions for the two previous months—or longer if it is more convenient—and review with the employees any instance in which cash was given for an unapproved reason. Employees should be instructed not to provide any illegal items, and in the case of a transaction not approved by the institution, the employee should report the same. There should also be a policy that prohibits employees from making the cash payment to anyone on their own; therefore, an approved method must be used for paying employees.

Inmates who have been designated as a work team must be placed under the control of the working supervisor in the institution. If these inmates are not being supervised by a staff member, they will have a hard time managing this process and will be seen as a liability, if not properly prepared. In fact, any inmate not properly supervised can be viewed as a liability if found out.

Working with the prison community is extremely important in this endeavor. Most work teams are located in segregation, and any illegal activity going on will be reported through inmates, who also use their illegal items. It is through the inmate grapevine that prisons have obtained most information. So it should not come as a surprise that prison administration is asking for a list of all employees who have had any association with money. With only an occasional refusal, most employees will submit their names. To be safe, the employee can fill out a false name and number for all items handled while employed, and a list of all inmates he or she worked with can be given to the administration. In addition, an inmate "buddy" list can be made to ensure that only inmates who have reported to the same institution as the employee are placed on the work team.

Many prison systems have the ability to place cameras inside and outside the prison. If this is the case in your jurisdiction, the administration should be sure that those areas where inmates have the ability to hide items are monitored. This will save the time and cost of having to go through a trial of each item recovered. In addition, an internal audit should be conducted on any inmate with access to money, goods, and services inside the prison. The administration should be aware of all instances of financial transactions, as well as the source of the funds (e.g., work assignment, inmate family). Any source of income by an inmate that exceeds his or her total financial obligations inside or outside the institution should also be included. If an inmate's financial transaction does not make sense, there is likely an item or items that the inmate is trying to hide.

BOMB SHELTERS AND SEARCHES**

**T** he ability to resist, evade, and escape has always been a dilemma for prison administrators. Over time, the methods available to a correctional officer are more and more limited as a product of technology. This allows for greater opportunity for prisoners to plan for their efforts to overcome the obstacles that await them.

The threat of a prison system becoming a target and being subject to a full-scale search is real. Whether it is a correctional officer who is the subject of a bombing or a prison being the target of a shooting, corrections administrators are trying to protect themselves by creating defenses. The more that prisons are being used as a form of "concentration camp" for many inmates, the greater the need to protect and defend.

### **Facility Location and Selection**

The location of a correctional facility is important in any discussion on prison security. If your administration is looking at changing sites, consider this:

• If the facility is in a secluded area, most likely the population would be less prone to violence.

• A facility in an open area, especially near a heavily trafficked area, could be more attractive to groups who want to cause chaos and possibly gain greater control over the facility.

• A campus with a perimeter fence is easier to defend than one with exterior fencing that is far from the prison facilities.

• A facility in a highly populated area should be avoided.

• The location of the prison should take into account a range of environmental variables, including temperature, wind, rain, soil composition, vegetation, and even the weather.

• Facilities in isolated areas will require more attention for fire protection.

**Security and Size**

An example of a facility that is located in a secluded area would be a small college or college-like facility with a large campus. This security model has been used for years and, in the eyes of the administration, provides a good blend of security and size. In a way, the selection of this model could be the result of the local community's influence on the area. Some administrators might choose an alternate site due to the fact that local citizens do not want to see a prison, while others might simply change because of community input. Either way, there should be a focus on a well-thought-out plan for an effective, secure, and well-run facility.

Security and size are not necessarily the same. Sometimes the size is large for one reason and the security is fine but at a smaller cost. When using this model, it is important to evaluate your staff and the security equipment that might be available. Large installations have a lot of equipment to meet the challenges of the size and population, and it can be expensive. Many of these programs are financed through outside grants, but they may not be as aggressive about what they expect of you.

Smaller institutions may or may not have any type of security program, or their needs could be met by outside consultants. Either way, in either event, a site analysis should take into account all the needed components, and the administration needs to be aware of what those components are. Most likely, the smaller the institution the smaller the area that needs to be assessed. Smaller institutions can be more prone to outside influence in the selection of their facilities. In these cases, it is more important to keep the facility near a population center, as opposed to some place that could be a million miles away.

### **Facility Design**

The size and layout of an institution, as well as a good deal of technology, may enhance prison security. For example, there are many advantages to being able to see inmates and what is happening around them. Being able to see into the institution, along with a variety of camera monitors and security systems, will not only enhance security but also greatly improve management of the day-to-day operations. In addition, having surveillance on an inmate can be a good deterrent for potential violence.

Another issue that needs to be considered in the design of the institution is its impact on staff and inmates. This is important because any improvements that would benefit inmates should also benefit the staff. However, the design needs to be careful not to have too many cameras, as this can be a source of frustration for both inmates and staff.

Facility design should also consider the location of emergency services. This will help with both planning and response to any emergencies that might arise. Being able to communicate with emergency services is also important, as many facilities will allow for that to occur. If not, consider having your facility near</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:47
