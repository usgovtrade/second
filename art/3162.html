In 1977, the Kansas City Band, along with Kansas City area resident Bill Carl, began performing classic rock at parties, dinners and concerts around Kansas City. The Band started to play a few original songs as well as some famous Kansas City classic rock songs such as: "Wabash Cannonball," "Take Me Out To The Ballgame," "Kansas City," "KC." In the fall of 1980, the band had the opportunity to perform on KCOY-TV's Nighttime Theater show. Later that same year, Bill Carl was recruited to play guitar for the original Kansas City band, known as Vintage Fever. Vintage Fever was formed to play at Stu & Sally's in Leawood, a local high school reunion honoring its 50th anniversary. The band featured Vintage Fever lead vocalist Joe D'Agostino. They played a full house and the reception was outstanding.

In 1981, the Kansas City Band evolved from a three piece cover band into a rock and roll band performing Kansas City classic rock at dances, parties and other venues in Kansas City, including: The Rock House, The Bunk House, The Sunset Lounge, The Westport and many other venues. The group added Tom McIntyre to the line-up on keyboards, guitar and vocals. Vintage Fever began playing concerts in local high schools and was becoming quite popular with the students and teachers. In 1983, Bill Carl left the group to pursue his own interests and the Kansas City Band added his former band mate Steve Toth to the line-up. In 1984, the group decided to change the name to Kansas City Band to reflect a wider musical coverage. Also in 1984, it was decided to go back to Vintage Fever with Joe D'Agostino as lead singer. Joe sang the songs that originally made the band famous, and the Kansas City Band continued to evolve its band from a Kansas City cover band to a live rock and roll group.

The Kansas City Band is well known for its outstanding performances in the Midwest. The band has performed at The Rock House, The Bunk House, The Sunset Lounge, The Westport, The West Kansas City Country Club, Stu & Sally's High School, The Country Club and many other prestigious venues. The group has provided entertainment for events such as: weddings, corporate events, parties, dances, retirement parties, weddings, concerts, school and other galas, school and alumni dinners, anniversary parties, and many other events.

The Kansas City Band is currently led by Steve Toth (Vocals/Lead Guitar), Joe D'Agostino (Lead Vocals) and Mike Zanatta (Bass Guitar/Background Vocals). All three members of the group have a</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:39
