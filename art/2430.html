"You don't wanna mess with your second chance." "You wanted to talk to me?" "What about?" "I wanted to thank you, for bailing me out." "You're gonna make a fortune on that book deal." "Why don't you save the taxpayers some money and write the check yourself?" "Why don't you just kick me while I'm down, why don't you?" "Hey, look, I got a new job, and it's going really well, and I was just thinking maybe you could come by the precinct..." "I don't think so." "Yeah." "It's better for both of us." "Get some sleep." "Yeah, I could do that." "Right now, right here." "Right here, right now." "So... what's wrong?" "What are you not telling me?" "Nothing." "I just feel like this is... what's the word?" "Old... out-of-date." "Well, why?" "Because I just had to hear about you two from Captain Holt." " What?" "Oh, my God, did you hear from the captain or something?" " No." "What happened?" "It was nothing." "I just made sure I didn't get called down there like you and Amy were." "Good night." "Oh, yeah." "Yeah, that's good." "Okay." "Yeah, okay." "Yeah." "What's this?" "Oh, yeah." "I just thought I'd keep it." "I got rid of the one with my face on it." "I thought about throwing the one without my face on it, but I don't have to work today, so..." "It is what it is." "Yeah." "I'll see you tomorrow?" "Yeah." "I love you." "Good night, hon." "Uh, I don't know where you just went, but you can't make us be partners." "I don't want to be partners." "Fine." "Okay, okay." "Um, we can try it." "But I want you to know that it's gonna be extremely difficult for me, that's a huge transition, and it's not for everyone." "I-I get that." "Well, you don't have to do it." "I'm just saying it's for some people." "I'm sorry, are you done speaking?" "No." "No, I'm not done speaking." "Well, you could start by closing your mouth." "The thing about being partner is you have to close your mouth and open it in order to open it and close it and open it again until the conversation is over." "Well, maybe if you did that, you'd have something interesting to say." "No, I don't." "I don't have anything interesting to say." "It's only interesting things that come out of my mouth." "I just hope you don't mind because..." "Because I'm gonna be writing it all down." "Yeah, you keep a running tally of everything you say?" "No, I do that." "Every night at home I just write down everything I've said that was relevant to the case." "No, that's a really bad idea." "Actually, it's not a bad idea." "It's a great idea, it's a brilliant idea, and... this is part of it." "Well, I can't wait to read what you say about me because I know that I'm gonna sound terrible." "But I've missed you." "So don't leave." "Just to say it again, you can stop with the running tally." " Okay." "You said that I'm..." "Can't hear you." "Yeah." " I missed you." "So..." "You didn't mention Lina's favorite color, you know, and I just found it kind of odd." "Okay, so I said you were very talented and that you were a good detective, but not as good as a good detective." "Yeah." "That's it." "Hey, it doesn't matter if you're not as good a detective as a good detective." "Well, no." "Yes." "No, it doesn't matter." "No, it doesn't matter." "What matters is that I don't like you." "And I like to make small talk when I don't like someone." "Well, in that case, we're done here." "Well, wait, wait, you are done now, but I was just getting started." "You're done now, too." "Great seeing you." "You, too." "Is this the room where you interrogate suspects?" "What?" "It's the room where you interview suspects, where you interrogate them." "Interrogate them?" "I'm not allowed to interrogate them." "They're not criminals." "Yeah, so we find the person who is guilty, and then we arrest them and interrogate them." "Are you suggesting I should violate their civil rights by coercing false confessions out of them?" "No, of course not." "I just don't think you should make fun of their clothes or their personal things or their body, like they can't have a penis or they can't like men or they can't like men as in women, like... so, like..." "That... okay." "That makes sense, like..." "I'm not gonna do that." "It's not a good idea." "I didn't say it was a good idea." "I'm not gonna do that either." "I don't care if it's good or bad." "Okay." "Okay." "All right, okay." "That was pretty good." "Yeah, I know." "Wait, did you want to do it the other way?" "You know what?" "It's better when you're just doing it and..." "Yeah, just trying to see where we can, you know..." "Yeah, I got it." "Got it." "No, I know, but, like, you were saying that Lina said that she wanted a... no..." "like a rainbow wedding or something like that and I just think we could even have one of those like a rainbow wedding and then we could do this." "So that you can say that she really wanted all the colors?" "Yeah." "But I don't want to say something that she didn't want, so..." "Yeah." "I would like to make that clear." "Okay." "Good." "Good." "Okay." "Okay." "Well, so..." "Right." "Well, I have a question." "Okay." "Okay." "Did you ask Lina how she wanted her ring?" "I didn't ask that, no." "I mean, it's Lina." "I know she's never worn a ring." "Okay." "I like that." "Yeah, I think we should go with that one." "I mean, it seems like it would have been important to her, you know, and, plus she didn't wear a ring." "Did you ask her, did she want a band or a..." "You know, 'cause that was like an hour..." "Did you ask her if she would want us to get her something smaller than a car?" "Did you ask her if she wanted you to get a car for her?" " Yeah, but it's not that big of..." "You don't have to get her a car for that." "But she's gonna ask for one." "No, but..." "I don't know, I mean, maybe not." "Because maybe she'd rather you give her something more important." "Wouldn't she give you something more important if you had money?" "Yeah, but I don't have any money." "That's the whole point!" "Oh, my God!" "Okay." "I mean..." "Yeah, okay." "Yeah, you're right." "Okay." "All right, okay." "You don't want the car, you know what you want?" "You want the house." "You said that before." "But that's the exact thing..." "And you know how to get a house." "Well, I do!" "I don't know how to get it, but, like, just with the stuff that you've given me," "I have a feeling that if we give the stuff to a real estate agent and say that it's all for her, that they'll give us the house, so let's go get the stuff and do that!" "Yeah, okay." "Okay, yeah." "So I want to make sure that we..." "When are we gonna go see the lawyer?" "We haven't made the appointment yet." "When are you gonna do that?" "We haven't made the appointment yet." "Are you sure you wanna be there for that?" "Do you want me to be there for that?" "Yeah, if we're gonna talk about this marriage thing." "I do." "Because I think I have an idea." "I'm gonna..." "Okay, I have an idea." "And I've been so focused on my work" "I haven't had a chance to be with you, but I really need to..." "Okay, I'm ready." "Good." "I want to be a real detective." "A real detective, not a desk jockey</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:30
