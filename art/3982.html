I got this for Christmas about 12 months ago and thought it would be a fun game to test drive for a few months and I didn't realise it until I saw the reviews that I should have had this all along! I really like this and it's a really different and very fun game. Great replay value as you can try to beat your last score and if you do you will unlock different costumes etc. The controls are fairly intuitive and the game's controls are responsive and not too hard to master. I especially like that if you die you're given time to plan your next move before you lose a turn. This is a really fun game which is worth the $1.99 and I think it's a lot of fun to play with friends and family. So buy this for your phone and let the family know you are a full fledged pirate when it comes to Christmas presents!

This has quickly become one of my favourite games and I can't believe I didn't play it before now! You can play it for free and as you unlock levels and new modes you will unlock new ship parts and characters to help you in battle against other ships. This game is easy to get into and it's tons of fun. The game is always changing so you're never bored with it. I really recommend it to any kind of gamer. Get this one if you love a good arcade game with some strategy to it!

I have only played this on a TV and I wish this was on Android or I would play this more often. It's really fun and it's one of my most played games on my phone. It's fun to be the pirate or a ninja fighting your way through levels of the game. I really recommend this game to anyone who loves arcade games!

This was a fun game which I was never able to enjoy on my PC (I use the XBOX 360). The game play was so addicting and even with different levels and modes there's always something new to try. I think the controls are fairly easy to control and it didn't take me long to figure it out. I find the controls are quite responsive and not too hard to master and this makes the game fun to play even when you lose all your power ups. So this is a really fun game and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new action arcade game.

This was a fun game and really kept me interested as well as making me feel quite frustrated as I tried to figure out how to solve the problems I kept coming across. The controls are rather complex but once you get the hang of them it's fun to play. You have quite a bit of strategy to use to win this and even though there are only 7 levels this is still quite challenging. I loved the game play of this and it's a fun and funny game. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun and challenging puzzle game.

I haven't found any Android games that have the same kind of style as the SNES games from back in the day. So this is quite a refreshing game to play and even though it's a modern game it's still really fun to play and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun puzzle game that challenges your mind and doesn't feel like a work out.

The way this game plays is just fantastic and it's really easy to get to grips with the way the game is played. I think that the controls are extremely responsive which makes the game fun to play. This is a very addicting game with lots of different levels and stages which keeps you coming back for more. If you like action games and simple arcade games this is a great choice. This is fun to play in short bursts and I would recommend this to anyone who likes an action type of game.

This was a fun game that I was never able to enjoy on my PC because the controls would get in the way. It's a really fun and addictive game and I just wish I had it on Android so I could play it again. The game play was really addictive and just like the PC game you had to avoid getting hit or you died. I found the game to be pretty easy to play and I think anyone can play this game without a problem. There are a couple of different modes you can play in as well as different levels that keep you coming back for more. I think it's a fun game and I hope this game is released to Android so that I can have the game on my phone. It's just a great game to play and that's why I think it's a good investment to buy this game if you really enjoy this fun addictive game.
