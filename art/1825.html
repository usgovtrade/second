EMIs can be divided into two groups:

  * Discrete product modules. These are separate modules that do not have any other function but to protect the cybersecurity function. This is the easiest way to protect the firewall.
  * Integrated modules that are integrated in the firewall itself. These would have a bigger effect than the discrete modules, but they can also be tampered with easier.
