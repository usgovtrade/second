It was introduced in the musical Square Jungle by Carol Channing.  In 1950 the song became a huge hit for Frank Sinatra, reaching number one on the U.S. pop charts. The lyrics, like most of Carmichael's songs, are about love and sexual desire.

The recording by the Weavers was so popular that it prompted an investigation by the American Legion for violations of the Hatch Act of 1939, which prohibited federal employees from taking an active part in political campaigns.

It was famously performed by Sam Jaffe in the 1954 movie The Caine Mutiny, about a mutiny aboard a U.S. Navy ship. It has also been recorded by Al Martino, Bing Crosby, and Ella Fitzgerald. It was featured in the 1993 film Swing Kids and became a number-one country hit for George Strait in 1999. 
"There's Gonna Be Hell to Pay" was featured in the film Swing Vote.
