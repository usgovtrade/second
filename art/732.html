I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things."



"Are we still friends?"; 



"Yes, we're friends.  Why?"; 



"I don't know, it just seems we 
have a strange relationship."



"What? Me with a straight guy?"; 



"Hey, come on, I'm not the only one. 
You got a guy."



"He died in a car crash."; 



"Was he drunk?"; 



"He was single, if that's what you mean."; 



"And?"; 



"I guess I'm just saying I don't need 
a friend.  I need a lover."



"Hey, I need you.  I'm not looking for anyone else."



"Really, because you wouldn't believe 
the number of guys that keep hitting on me."; 



"I told you I don't think this is a good 
idea."; 



"Just kiss me."



"I didn't know you were gay."; 



"Oh, I've always been gay."



"I just thought you 
were bisexual"; 



"I am. I'm not sure what happened, I 
tried being with a woman and it just didn't feel right."



"So you are gay, 
it's just bisexuals that you 
haven't tried?"; 



"It's not about that."; 



"Yes, it is. I can't be gay and sleep 
with women, but you can.  I don't get it."



"This is stupid.  I'm not gay, I'm not
trying to be gay.  I just want a boyfriend."; 



"Well, maybe we could still be friends. 
A
lternative
sex 
has 
always 
intrigued 
me.";



"Me too."; 



"Doesn't stop me from making jokes about 
it."; 



"Did you know 
there's a group for 
gay guys 
who have 
alternative sex?";



"Really? I can't wait 
to meet the guys."; 



"You do know you're gay, right?"; 



"No. Really. I'm not sure how to 
come out of the closet when 
I've never been in it."; 



"Ok. Just keep me around, please. 
Until 
you decide what you 
want."



"I just don't want to be alone, that's 
all. 
Maybe there's no 
right time to tell anyone.";



"Maybe you're gay and
just 
don't 
know it.";



"Gay's the only 
word that describes it."; 



"Yeah, I guess it 
could be."; 



"So when are you going to start 
dating guys? 
Cause I can help you."; 



"No. Just kidding.  I have a 
boyfriend and I'm going 
to 
stay 
with 
him. 
I 
think 
I'll 
end 
up 
spending 
the 
rest 
of 
my life
alone.";



"You are so 
funny."; 



"Hey, come on.  I'm not saying I don't 
want to go out with you again. 
I just don't have the 
time. 
My
boyfriend 
has 
a 
big 
weekend. 
I 
didn't 
think 
about
you."



"Oh, but that's the thing, I don't 
want you to go out with me 
again."; 



"So you are gay."; 



"It's not that.  I just
don't 
want 
to 
be
with 
you.";



"Really?  I get that all the time. 
Don't feel bad."; 



"Well, if you know so much about 
it, then you tell me about your
boyfriend."; 



"Ok. There's really not much to tell. 
He's really nice.  We
have 
fun. 
I 
feel 
happier
when 
I'm 
with 
him.";



"So you're into him."; 



"Kind of. I mean, I like him, it's 
more about feeling good 
than
sex 
with 
any 
guy."; 



"So it's like you're 
in-love with him."; 



"Something like that."; 



"You have feelings for him.";



"It sounds so complicated. 
It's not."



"Oh, sorry. You must be 
really deep into 
things."; 



"It's not complicated."; 



"Oh, ok. I 
was just
worried."; 



"It's not. Let's go have lunch. 
You can 
tell 
me 
more."



"How can I? You won't shut up.";



"You just seem like a nice girl. 
I'll try."; 



"You know, all my friends seem to 
have some 'alternative' guy."; 



"Yeah, not my thing.";



"I don't want to be an alternative 
girl,
just for the
sake of it.";



"I'm into relationships, not sex.";



"You don't have a boyfriend. 
Why 
aren't 
you 
with
someone?";



"I have a boyfriend. 
You're 
the one 
who 
doesn't
believe 
in 
love."



"Is that why you keep 
yourself
to 
yourself 
around 
the 
guy
you 
love?";



"Would you like to go out with me 
again?"; 



"I don't know. I mean, I don't know 
if I can handle a bisexual again. 
Plus, I can get anyone I want."


"So why is he a priority?"; 



"Hey, I get it. I totally
get 
it."; 



"Is it because he's a 
little more
manly 
than me?"; 



"No. 
He just
has more in
common
with 
my 
friends.";



"I don't think you understand. 
It 
has 
absolutely 
nothing 
to do 
with 
him.";



"If you're talking about 
myself, I've got to 
laugh. 
I'm not going to be 
with 
my 
boyfriend 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
life.";



"There are lots of other guys out there. 
It's so easy, you just have
to go 
for 
it.";



"Really? What does that mean? 
Am 
I 
supposed 
to
meet them?
I'm sorry, but I don't really feel the
same way.";



"Look. 
I know 
there's a 
whole 
huge 
gay 
world 
out 
there. 
The
only 
thing 
I know 
is 
that
I 
have 
a 
boyfriend 
who 
I 
think
I'm 
going 
to 
be 
with
for 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
life. 
I 
guess 
I'm 
not 
your 
kind 
of
girl.";



"Maybe not, but if that's how you
feel, 
you don't 
need to change. 
You 
don't 
need to 
try 
to 
be 
gay, 
like 
I 
have. 
You 
just 
need 
to
understand 
how 
it 
feels.";



"How would I understand? You 
don't 
understand.";



"Are you saying 
you're 
trying to 
convert 
me? 
Just so 
you 
know, 
this 
isn't 
working 
out.";



"Maybe it's just me."; 



"I knew you were gay."



"Then 
why did 
you tell 
me to 
try 
women?"; 



"I did it to find out what I was into.";



"And what did you find out?"; 



"You</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:57
