The President is calling on the federal government to strengthen enforcement of existing criminal law to increase penalties and enforcement, particularly in the areas of identity theft and health care fraud. It is also a priority of the President to strengthen the enforcement of existing federal criminal law by:

Establishing a program to provide rewards to individuals for helping to detect fraud or return illegally-obtained property.

Providing funds to increase the number of trained investigators in the Department of Justice to combat mortgage fraud and identify and prosecute identity theft.

Supporting enforcement of laws against telemarketers fraud and other identity theft.

Promoting greater cooperation between federal, state, and local law enforcement, including assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies in strengthening federal laws against identity theft and assisting them in making their own laws more effective against these crimes.

The President is also calling on the federal government to provide greater assistance to victims of identity theft, domestic violence, and stalking by:

Improving state and local prosecution of victims of domestic violence and stalking.

Establishing a National Council on Domestic Violence to coordinate federal and state criminal justice responses to domestic violence, stalking, and other forms of violence against women.

Requiring the states and the federal government to cooperate in the development of public awareness campaigns on domestic violence and stalking.

To improve the response to domestic violence and sexual abuse, the President is calling on the Department of Justice to require all grant recipients to provide for the provision of victim services and advocacy for victims and survivors, require all federal grantees to implement comprehensive training programs to educate program staff on sexual abuse and domestic violence issues, require all state grant recipients to ensure victim access to their services, and include sexual abuse and domestic violence prevention programs in every grant application to the Department of Justice.

The Department of Justice’s Office for Victims of Crime is one of the nation’s most effective crime-fighting resources and makes billions of dollars available each year to state, local, and tribal communities for crime prevention, investigations, victim assistance, and education and training. The office supports local communities in the development of effective local programs and projects through partnerships, information exchange, and technology transfer. The office also supports state and local communities in enhancing their ability to respond to and recover from crime. The office also ensures victims receive the justice they deserve through coordinated services provided by many different federal agencies.

The Office for Victims of Crime implements federal statutes intended to make communities safer by strengthening public safety, health, and welfare services, assisting victims of crime, protecting witnesses of crime, and expanding the rights of victims in court and through legislative activities. Since its inception in 1984, OVCS has helped provide services to victims of all crimes to a level that is currently unmatched in the world, at no cost to the American taxpayer. The OVCS has established over 900 partnerships with state and local governments, and community-based organizations across the United States. OVCS will continue to work with state, local, and tribal governments, victim service providers, non-profit organizations, and the private sector to implement the President’s Victims’ Rights Executive Order.

The Victims of Crime Act was enacted in 1984 to restore, strengthen, and enhance the capacity of state and local crime victim services and to enhance the effectiveness of federal assistance to the States for victim services. It reauthorized and expanded the existing Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) in the 1986 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) was established in 1992 to support victims and victims’ services in meeting a range of needs following a crime. The CVF provides for both federal grants and mandatory contributions by the states. The CVF became a permanent program of the Justice Department in 1996.

The Office of Justice Programs plays a key role in meeting the President’s mandate for programs that prevent crime and provide justice. The Attorney General is required to make the full resources of the Department available in meeting these two objectives. The Department of Justice supports both state and local programs for victim services with discretionary grants and discretionary contributions, as well as funding provided under reauthorized anti-crime legislation.

Since the mid-1980s, the Department has responded to violent crime by providing increased attention to victim services. A number of important policies have been implemented. Most of these have centered around a central concern, the treatment of victims and victims’ services. The National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC) was formed in 1984 to help victims of crime and their families; it has been an integral part of the Department’s victim assistance effort. Also formed in 1984 was the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), which provides the Department with a mechanism to organize and implement federal programs in support of victim services and assistance programs.

Since 1989, OVC has engaged in efforts to enhance victim assistance programs, primarily through state and local coalitions, in the following programs:

The President is calling on the Congress to provide comprehensive sex offender management policies and procedures for all states.

The President is directing the Attorney General to expand the National Child Protection Training Center by $2.5 million to help provide and maintain comprehensive sex offender management training for all federal grant recipients, including public, private, and religious entities, as well as public and private K-12 schools and day care providers.

The President is directing the Attorney General to collaborate with the States and local communities in developing and enhancing policies for sex offender management by enhancing the current community notification database known as Megan’s Law.

To improve sex offender management, the President is calling on the Attorney General to expand the National Sex Offender Public Website to provide resources about effective policies, improve public awareness, and promote public participation and education on sex offender management.

The President is directing the Attorney General to ensure that federal prosecutors enforce existing criminal law that protects individual privacy and restricts the Government’s use of personal information without probable cause or judicial approval to prosecute individuals or organizations involved in fraud, identity theft, or other economic crime.
