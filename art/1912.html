A Laugh In Itself" (also known as the "Big Bad Wolf Song") was included in the movie "Rock-A-Doodle" (1942), featured in "Flight of the Doves" (1943), as well as the 1940s radio series "Famous Jury Trials", and was often used by vaudevillian Ted Healy as a curtain-raiser.

The song was also used as the opening music for the radio program "Time For Beany", broadcast by CBS Radio, the radio program "Famous Jury Trials", broadcast by CBS Radio, and the radio program "The Fred Allen Show", also broadcast by CBS Radio.

The 1944 Columbia Pictures film "Hitler's Children" included it.  It was also featured on a CBS Radio network program which starred Orson Welles.

Marlene Dietrich sang a version on The Aldrich Family radio show. The lyrics were adjusted to be in reference to her, and to refer to another character in the show.
