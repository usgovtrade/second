Curse of Flesh is a bit of a rough draft (as well as quite a polished one, which is evident from the writing and art), but does a really good job of establishing that sort of framework in a way that any sort of future update could expand upon without breaking the game as it currently stands. The game isn’t actually dead yet, with new content, mechanics, and systems being added all the time and a lot of this will be folded into future releases. It does an excellent job of allowing for that sort of expansion by using modular gameplay elements and making sure that nothing feels integral. It’s really quite impressive. It’s also a good example of how to get good games out without breaking budgets, doing something as bare-bones as it is.

I really cannot recommend this game enough. It’s a real shame that it’s so obscure. It’s free, but not free at all, which means it’s really only for those who care. It’s a game with potential, an actual story that the reader is a part of, a great setting, a variety of characters, great writing and solid story arcs, and an extremely immersive setting that pulls the player in with incredible ease. It’s an incredible work of fiction, but I’d also just recommend it as a fantastic tabletop RPG that I myself have played for quite a while.

And again, I can’t stress this enough. This game is incredible. It’s one of the best tabletop RPGs I’ve played. If you have the opportunity to try it, don’t hesitate. I’d recommend starting off with the standard build (unless you’re already familiar with the game), but make sure you take a read through the books so you know what’s going on, as that makes a difference.
