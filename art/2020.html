We want to help writers of short stories get their short fiction out into the world.

So, if you're looking for some interesting reading matter with a new short story every two weeks, please consider joining our community. Go to hotmessfiction.com and tell us what you think of the new site!

“A Forkful of Bad Dudes” will be released by our first sponsor, Snarled Sip. Snarled Sip is our very first sponsor in the world of short fiction, and we are excited about that! If you sign up at their website (which is snarledsip.com), you will receive a snarl of bad dudes and a free copy of my short story “One Week of Unplanned Vacations.” You will also have the opportunity to be one of the first readers and judge of future entries.

Thank you to our awesome sponsors who make Hot Mess possible:

I would like to mention one thing: if you support the Hot Mess fiction community and are able to help with the cost of the website by buying anything from the above links, please use the links below to help keep the Hot Mess going:

The first two links are for artists who are new to our blog and have graciously donated some of their amazing artwork.

The third link is a special edition of a collection of paintings we are publishing called:
“You’ve Got Heart… Let’s Talk About Art“
This is a collection of art about important issues and how we as individuals can positively make a difference in our local communities and our world. The book can be purchased directly from the artist at this link.

The fourth link is an eBook we published called “Paint and Draw Your Politicians.” This eBook can be found at this link and includes a drawing of your elected officials, their party affiliation, and your elected officials’ voting record.

The fifth link is an EPUB file of our new book, “Zines and Artist’s Books.”

This is an ongoing project we are creating as an archive of our art and zines in an eBook format. This book will be downloadable in the eBook formats available for download now. This project is still under construction, but when it’s finished you’ll be able to buy the eBook from this link.
