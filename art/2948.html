Through my conversations with the City Manager I began to discover my own unique expertise in project management and the tools I was able to apply to the team’s efforts. These tools include being able to organize schedules, work plans and schedules, and I was able to bring it all together into a project management tool. This gives me a sense of confidence as I work together with other staff, particularly with those who are less familiar with project management.

This project is really starting to come together, and I feel like I am beginning to be a part of the team. The biggest success has been making connections across various departments, and I am realizing that I have a passion for working with people and how my work can impact the lives of those I will interact with.

This internship experience has given me an excellent sense of accomplishment, and I am really excited to see how I will grow here.

A few weeks ago I arrived at the office of the City of Santa Cruz Public Works. My day started off as the team met to discuss the project team members and assigned work. I was also assigned to work with Ben and Scott. At the time I knew that Ben would be helping with surveying and designing the plan. Scott would be the site superintendent.

I really enjoyed the team meeting and how everyone contributed different points of view to the group. We talked about the goals we wanted to accomplish and how we would get there. There were a lot of ideas that were shared. I thought it was very important for us to establish trust, values, and vision in order for us to accomplish our goals.

The team meeting turned into a brainstorming session for the team and everyone contributed to the meeting. Some of the things discussed were: the first week onsite, what to look for on the lot, how to get to the site, what tasks need to be completed, who we can count on, how to do our due diligence. The overall message to be sent to the community was to bring safety and respect. In addition to this, we discussed the possibility of getting a fence on the site. We decided to take care of this first before we move forward with a fence.

This past week I did a site walk at the future location of the new homeless shelter. This site walk was crucial for us to understand the site before building. I learned a lot from the walking and being in the field. The site walk gave me a chance to see the property and have a more in-depth look at what will be built. I was also able to pick up many tools and resources that will help me with this project.

This week at City Hall, Scott and I have been taking measurements for the lot and developing a plan to develop the parking lot and a path onto the property. We are looking at the potential lot, creating a plan to bring the existing parking lot up to code, and developing a design for the parking lot.

A few things that I have observed this week: 1) the team is all committed to our shared vision for a sustainable City, 2) people working together and learning from each other is a great way to get things done, 3) I have been working very hard to pay attention to the smallest details, and 4) I feel much more prepared for this type of job than I did a few weeks ago.

There has been a strong sense of teamwork in all that I have experienced this week. I have been trying to be more open-minded and try new things. Learning as I go is the best way to begin a job.

I really enjoyed the day when we did the site walk. I saw that the design of the parking lot had to go through several different public hearing procedures. A significant amount of time and funding had already been put into the project. Although that seemed overwhelming, I realized it was helpful to know ahead of time what to expect and it prepared me for the challenges I will face.

After the site walk, I started looking at how to put in the parking lot, and I had a plan to do this in three days. But I took two days to do this. It was a slow process and I could see why this kind of project takes a couple of years to complete. I really want to help as much as I can and contribute to the team.

The best part of the week was the city council meeting. We got to say good morning, how are you doing and thank you. It really made me feel comfortable and like I was contributing to the project. We were asked to discuss a few things and I offered some feedback. It felt good to contribute and to see that my comments were valued.

I have made sure that I get up early every morning and work really hard because I think this is going to be the only way I can survive my first week here. This is probably one of the hardest things I have ever done and I am very excited to start the rest of this project.

I have spent the past few weeks learning about the history of our City of Santa Cruz and how our actions as individuals and as a community contribute to the future of our city. I have learned how people come together to provide innovative and creative solutions to our community issues. I have discovered that it is our commitment and our relationships with one another that can make a difference.

It is clear from all of the community events, the public meeting, and the city council meeting that the people of our city are truly concerned with our collective future. I have felt this concern through the people I have met and through their interactions with one another.

I am excited to be involved in this project and work with such an enthusiastic and dedicated team. I feel that all of us are united by a common spirit and desire to contribute to the vitality of our city. It is for that reason that our team and I are excited to continue on this journey to move the City forward.

The last couple of weeks I have been in the office every day learning new things. I have been reading a lot of reports, learning how things work, and making lists of what I need to do. This morning I worked with Scott and learned how to plan the construction. We looked at the lot next to the building, discussed what we will need for site supervision, and what we will need to build the site on.

I got my first City permit for sidewalk clearance. I will take pictures for my permit photos and be sure to have my insurance coverage updated as well.

I am looking forward to the next week when we get to look at the other parking lots and decide on which ones we will use for our construction. It is important to know how many spots we have to accommodate the community.

It was very exciting this week to see the new building go up. It was a large event and there were many people in the office to celebrate. This building is special because it is going to help many people. As we move forward with this project I am excited to be a part of it.

After I arrived at the office, I had the opportunity to attend a meeting with the Council on September 28, 2013. I enjoyed getting to know Mayor Chris Lenz better and learn about the responsibilities he has in the City of Santa Cruz.

On October 2, 2013, I was able to get my first experience in the field and get my hands dirty. I did all of this while I was participating in a large group project that was a collaboration between local youth and a nonprofit. In one afternoon we were able to construct three large wooden planters as well as landscape a vacant lot.

Even though it has been stressful and tiring, I have learned that we have the City of Santa Cruz's best interest in mind. We are working towards a brighter future for our community, one step at a time.

I feel very fortunate to be part of this exciting project and to be with such an amazing team. Everyone in the office has a passion for the city, and I feel lucky to be a part of this team.

I am very thankful for my time at City Hall and for the opportunity to work with people who care deeply about this project. It is now my turn to give back to the community by making this project a success. I will do my part to see that it succeeds.

From the time I arrived at the office on August 14, I have been learning about the City of Santa Cruz and all of the different departments within the city. I have been trying to understand what I am doing here and what is expected of me. It was very helpful to work with other staff members and learn about their various responsibilities.

This past week was my first day in the field on a construction site. I was able to gain an understanding of the responsibilities of the different professions on a construction site. This site had a lot of challenges such as erosion from heavy rains. This was very interesting to me because I have never worked on this type of project.

We arrived at our first construction</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:56
