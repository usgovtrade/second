A: I think it is very good news because there is no remote in this tv. If you get this model then you must have to download mythtv to operate the TV. I have got the same model of Sony TV but there is no remote. You must download mythtv to operate this tv.

Bryan is right. When this TV was released in 2010, Sony introduced "MyRemote" as a default application. You can get a copy of MyRemote from the Android Market. Just open MyRemote and follow the instructions, which are written in the lower left corner of the main screen. You can find some useful information there. Also, MyRemote is pretty versatile, and you can use it to control many other devices, not just Sony TVs.

When it comes to remote, it's hard to get some good suggestions because there are so many types of remotes to deal with. If you have the HDTV Remote app in your Android, it will recognize the signal from your TV, but I'm not sure how to make it work in MyRemote. The problem with this app is it was designed for the PS3, which has a very different remote. The best solution for this is to call the manufacturer's customer service and they can help you install a new set of drivers.

If you already have a PC, the easiest way is to hook it up to your TV using the VGA cable. Then go to Add > Hardware > Remotes > HDMI > Sony. This will make the computer recognize the new remote in the video settings and add the function to your menu. This is probably the easiest method.

Lastly, if you have the Sony Remote app, you can download MyRemote from the Android Market.

You should definitely be able to get a remote working. This app is pretty versatile, and you can download an older version of it from the Android Market for free. I'd just check with Sony about that.
