He has also appeared on several programs, such as “Dr. Ken,” “Scandal” and “The Real,” and he has landed roles in the movies “Tears of the Sun,” “Whiteout,” and “The Equalizer.”

“I don’t see myself as one of these comedians who came up by accident and are lucky enough to have found a career. There was a lot of hard work involved, but I love that,” he said.

“Growing up in North Carolina, there were no black professionals, as far as I can tell. People like Richard Pryor and people from the ‘70s and ‘80s were all the most high-profile black people I knew of,” he said.

“At the end of the day, there was nothing there, so you had to look elsewhere.”

He pointed to the “Race” episode of “Fresh Off the Boat,” in which Louis struggles with a college professor who is a racist, as proof of his commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement.

“That episode was my favorite one I’ve ever done. I grew up watching that show and knew that that was the show that I wanted to do one day. [Aside from] being involved with the show, I loved that episode and was honored to be in it,” he said.

Though the timing might have been better, the success of “Fresh Off the Boat” is a good thing for him, especially because it gives him the opportunity to connect with an entire new audience.

“I hope the show does very well and I hope it shows that there are good black characters on TV, and that you don’t need a special show to play an extraordinary role,” he said. “That’s why the episode was so important to me. It was important to me to break down stereotypes.”

“You never know where life is going to lead you. I’m very happy and very lucky to be here today, and you just need to seize the moment. That’s all I can do.”
