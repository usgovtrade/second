Dear Friends: I have been busy with getting ready for the New Year’s Eve show, as many of you have seen in my Facebook posting. I have got the show together in two acts. To have music for both was a little tough, but I think it is now settled. Act One will have one vocalist plus 6 or 7 horns, plus three of our regular ten-piece horn section playing at least one solo on each of their instruments, and the second act will have the ten-piece horn section plus a featured vocalist. Of course, the six men and women that make up the horn section would be taking turns at the microphone during the first set as well.

It will be a lot of fun to play the trumpet for so many people and I hope we will get a good crowd to our New Year’s Eve show, which starts at 7:00 and ends at 2:00 a.m., I believe. For those who want to arrive early for the night shows, we are scheduled to go on stage at 7:00 and the second set will end about 10:00, if I am not mistaken. I know people from all parts of New York state will be coming up for this New Year’s Eve Show. They will come by their own car, by train, or even by bicycle, but we’d like you to know that you won’t need a car, train, or bicycle. You can walk, there are buses running in and out of the Orpheum Theater in Lockport as well as shuttle buses that leave from the New York State Fairgrounds and will bring us people back to this location from Lockport. People can be picked up at the Fairgrounds, but must return to the Fairgrounds. There are public bathrooms there. Here are the phone numbers for the shuttle buses.

The tickets for this show are priced at $30, which includes the ticket and a nice meal, and dinner, if you choose. The only thing I ask of you is that you be there by 7:30 and you can enjoy the evening shows. If you can’t make it that early you are invited to come early and see the first of the two shows by that time, or after 7:00 in the morning for the second set. Also I encourage you to bring out any friends who want to hear some fine music, enjoy a fine meal, and to perhaps even throw a hat into the ring for the raffle. I know we have many friends who will want to do that. I hope I see you at the Orpheum on New Year’s Eve, and remember for all the good New Year’s resolutions that you could make for 2013. You may wish to stop drinking, but I don’t recommend it for New Year’s Eve. It’s already a fine show, but having a little drink and a little dancing for a New Year’s Eve show would make it more enjoyable for you and everyone. Bring out a friend and a bottle of wine and you can sit in a warm spot, put your feet up, take in the enjoyment of the music, and drink up.

Let me know, then, that you are coming out for the show and please share this message with anyone else you think might like to attend. I hope I see you, and I hope you have a very enjoyable New Year’s Eve. We’ll see you at 7:00 p.m., don’t forget to come early to catch both shows, just to make sure you can enjoy the evening.

You might want to be aware that we are performing a little music for “A New Year’s Eve Salute to Louis Armstrong.” We will be performing our rendition of Louis’ “Auld Lang Syne.” It is a tune with which many of us have learned and many a tune that has become a part of many an annual gathering.

Here are a few words from Mr. Armstrong’s version of “Auld Lang Syne.” I hope you enjoy it, just like most of the people in the country:

New Year’s Day, New Year’s Day,
(Repeat)

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy, comfort and joy

It’s a long, long way to Tipperary,
It’s a long long way to go.

To TIPPERARY, to TIPPERARY,
And it’s a long long way to go.

Well, you can kiss your wife, then you can kiss your old mother,
BOTH on the same sleeve.

And you can kiss your little child and bid it goodnight.
All this you can do.

But you can’t get back to your wife, and your family,
and friends, that you had before.

Oh, we’ll drink a cup of kindness, for sake of absent friends,
we’ll drink a cup of kindness to them, to them.

To TIPPERARY, to TIPPERARY,
And it’s a long long way to go.

We’ll clink our glasses all together, we’ll clink our glasses,
in honor of the poor.

We’ll drink a full tankard, we’ll drink a full tankard,
of anything so good as whisky!

We’ll drink a cup of kindness, for sake of absent friends,
we’ll drink a cup of kindness to them, to them.

To TIPPERARY, to TIPPERARY,
And it’s a long long way to go.

We’ll clink our glasses all together, we’ll clink our glasses,
in honor of the poor.

We’ll drink a full tankard, we’ll drink a full tankard,
of anything so good as whisky!

We’ll drink a cup of kindness, for sake of absent friends,
we’ll drink a cup of kindness to them, to them.

To TIPPERARY, to TIPPERARY,
And it’s a long long way to go.

Let’s go and kiss our sweethearts
By the old oak tree.
It’s better than any kiss we can buy in a store,
and far better than a bottle of wine.

So come and join the fun,
We’ll drink a cup of kindness, for sake of absent friends,
we’ll drink a cup of kindness to them, to them.

To TIPPERARY, to TIPPERARY,
And it’s a long long way to go.

So come and join the fun,
We’ll drink a cup of kindness, for sake of absent friends,
we’ll drink a cup of kindness to them, to them.

To TIPPERARY, to TIPPERARY,
And it’s a long long way to go.

I found this on the Internet while looking for the lyrics to “Auld Lang Syne,”
from the Wikipedia website. See below:

“Auld Lang Syne” is the name of a traditional Scottish song, written in 1788 by Robert Burns for a poem of the same name that had appeared in 1796 in William Tait’s Scots Musical Museum.The song was published in 1799, and the “Happy New Year” lyrics that many people are familiar with were written in 1895 by W.B. Rands.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:05
