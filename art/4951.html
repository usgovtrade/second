7th Edition

By Richard W. Clary

The new edition of “Battle of the Atlantic” follows in the tradition of the award-winning sixth edition. While the core scenario design remains unchanged, many additions and improvements have been made, bringing the Atlantic War experience more closely in line with the war in North Africa. A new theater of operations – the Arctic Ocean – allows players to relive the harsh battles fought between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.

All components have been improved, including new maps, rules and units. An expanded selection of ship and aircraft data offers both greater detail and options for customization. New equipment has been added, including aircraft, submarine, and landing craft rules, weapons, and aircraft ordnance, as well as the new Luftwaffe reconnaissance plane, Heinkel He-117.

The game now uses a series of easy to use scenarios with well-designed, historical maps to illustrate the fighting in various theaters.

Battle of the Atlantic features:

New Scenario Designs: A new series of scenario packs allow quick access to more than 70 new scenarios that allow players to relive battles in the Arctic Ocean, the Eastern Atlantic, and Mediterranean. New historical maps also offer insights into the Battle of the Atlantic and the war at sea as whole.

More Realistic Gaming Experience: Improved rules and data provide a more realistic gaming experience. The game has been greatly expanded with new play aids, improved weapons and equipment for the Germans and the Allies, and rules that more accurately describe the naval warfare of World War II.

Expanded Play Options: More flexibility and additional customization is provided through improved rules for ship gunnery, aircraft, torpedoes and depth charges, radar, radar-controlled interceptions, submarines, and land-based attack aircraft, including aircraft, bombs, and torpedoes.

Faster Play: A new quick-start rules option improves ease-of-play and allows the game to be set up in half the time.

More Strategic Play: A number of new rules add greater strategic play options. The game can be used to fight individual battles, campaign games, and larger-scale fleet actions.

More Modular Combat: All player units have undergone substantial revision with new rules, allowing for faster play, greater realism, and a better understanding of what occurred during the Battle of the Atlantic.
