and   inadmissibility   "from      those    of   like   grade    and     rank,

subject . . . to such exceptions as the President of the United

States may authorize in regulations to be made."                 The Board was

unambiguously granted the authority to make exceptions and "such

exceptions as the President may authorize in regulations to be

made" to "[t]he general rule."        The President delegated his power

to establish rules concerning inadmissibility to the Secretary

of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary

of State.    See 6 U.S.C. § 202(5), 6 U.S.C. § 202(3).

      ¶70   The    President     authorized       the   Secretary        of     State

"to make rules to provide for the prompt exclusion and expulsion

of aliens . . . ."          8 U.S.C. § 1221(a).               "The power to

delegate . . . is implied in the grant of authority to the

President."     United States v. Guess, 543 F.2d 698, 703 (5th Cir.

1976).     The Board has authority to make exceptions from a rule

that establishes inadmissibility "such exceptions as the President

may authorize in regulations to be made," which is to say, the

Board may interpret the regulation, including by adding to the

regulations.

      ¶71   Although    the    "general    rule"      generally    requires       the

denial of visas, the President has expressly permitted the Board

to deviate from this general rule by permitting a noncitizen to

obtain a visa if that noncitizen has no history of past conduct

that would be disqualifying under this rule, among other conditions

for issuance of a visa.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)(B).              This visa
exemption,      however,     "shall     not    be   regarded       as    providing
immunity from the application of the [provision in the United

                                                               No.    2017AP1269.akz


States Code] that bars admission of . . . aliens who advocate or

assist terrorist activity."              Id.

     ¶72   In other words, the visa exemption is a special visa

application which should not be confused with general admission of

noncitizens for permanent resident visas.               As a result, any noncitizen

who applies for this visa exemption cannot be said to apply for

admission into the United States but instead is seeking a visa

application.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15).

     ¶73   There are three ways a noncitizen may apply for a visa,

at the time of application, based on admissibility requirements:

(1) he can be present in the United States and seeking admission,

8 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(4); (2) he can be seeking admission but be

"inspected and admitted" as a temporary nonimmigrant or "parole"

nonimmigrant, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(1), (2), 1251(a)(2), 1252(a)(1),

1255(a); and (3) he can be seeking admission as an immigrant,

8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15).          The visa exemptions, however, are for

noncitizens who seek to immigrate.             See 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g) (stating
that a "visa" is "an alien's document authorizing entry into the

United States"); see also, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1203(d)(3) (referring
to a "nonimmigrant visa"); 8 U.S.C. § 1184 (referring to a "visa

"); 8 U.S.C. § 1255(d) (referring to a "visa" or "application for

admission").

     ¶74   Noncitizens must apply for a visa before the Department
of State may issue visas to them.               This requirement, however,

does   not   preclude    the   noncitizen's      attempting      to    obtain   the

consular    non-immmigration      visa   exemption      from     the    Secretary
of State because "the executive branch of government . . . lacks

direct authority to enforce immigration law" and therefore must

"rely on private parties to carry out its mission."                            Dickson v.

Sec'y of Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1403 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (quotations

omitted).

      ¶75    We    conclude        that   the    law    governing         the   noncitizen

status of Petitioners under the INA is clear and unequivocal.

              3.     The Board's decision is consistent with case law
                     and statutory provisions.
      ¶76    Respondents         argue   that       the     Board's      denial    of     the

noncitizens' claims under the INA violated their constitutional

rights, and we must therefore "exercise great caution in making

such a policy judgment."           Nelson v. Williams, 624 F.3d 893, 899

(7th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).                   However, there is no reason

to suspect that the Board's interpretation and application of the

INA would   deny       due    process,     either         substantive        or   procedural

due process.      Accordingly, we examine the Board's decision under

the constitutional standards described above.                       The constitutional

issues must be resolved on a case-by-case basis.

      ¶77    For example, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393
(1857), the United States Supreme Court struck down a law that

excluded   citizens      of   Africa    from         participating       in   the   Missouri

Territorial   Legislature.            The       law    effectively        denied    Africans

citizenship in the United States, even though citizens were not

excluded from entry into the United States.                       60 U.S. at 413.         The

Supreme   Court      held    that    the      denial        of    citizenship      was   not

constitutionally valid because "the right of citizenship was
reserved to the white race alone, and any one abridging the

privileges or immunities of a citizen of the United States is

thereby declared guilty of a crime."                  Id. at 413-14.

     ¶78   The Board's decision to exclude noncitizens who have

engaged in criminal activity is analogous to the denial of a

citizen's claim to due process under the Dred Scott decision.                            A

noncitizen's attempt to obtain a waiver of inadmissibility has

been viewed "not as the award of a privilege or an immunity but

as a privilege of entry into this country, not one of citizenship,

and a waiver thereof would be a waiver of nothing more than a

privilege, a form of partial disentitlement, which if granted

would allow a nonimmigrant alien to live permanently in this

country."   Matter of Correa, 19 I. & N. Dec. 130, 134 (BIA 1985)

(explaining   inadmissibility      based       on     criminal    conduct     by   a

visitor).     The   Board's   interpretation         of   the    INA    in   similar

situations is not unconstitutional.                  The Board has the power to

determine      admissibility      and     ineligibility          to    receive      an
immigration benefit, and its application of the law in this case

was reasonable.

     ¶79   An analysis of the United States Supreme Court's cases

has    suggested   that   the   Board's          decisions     are     rational      in
