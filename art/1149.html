I know you're asking yourself, "Okay, so what's
this have to do with anything, I'm not a zoom client
how could this possibly relate to me?"

Well, I'll make it easy for you by telling you what's
not about you -- you're not a zoom client.

No? Really?

I mean sure you want the best for your clients...

but you are not their best friend. The fact is, you
never will be if you view each meeting like one big
party, complete with drinks and loud voices and more
food than the four of you could possibly eat.

I mean come on, you've got your own company to run and
your own team to manage so...

what are you doing over the lunch hour? How about
e-mail or a conference call to discuss it over?

But you know what? It may sound easy to you but for
them, it's not.

You see it's like the difference between being inside
and outside a house and watching people you don't know
walk by. See if you can't see how it's different to be
somewhere else and watching the same house to see
people you do know inside?

Just like Zoom. When you use the Zoom meeting, you're
not just watching, you're inside a house. Or rather, you
are inside of your clients' house, but you're on the
other side of the street with them - even though the
house is across the street.

Zoom is for you if the other person isn't at home.

See. So when you're thinking, "That sounds a little
weird, what's the other person's real name?" or, "I
can't imagine not knowing who was on the other end of
the conference call", that's all irrelevant.

It's no different than not knowing the names of people
that pass you on the street or in the lobby of the
office. It's all the same, you can't know someone who's
not at home. You can't meet them. You can't shake their
hand. You can't touch their shoulder. And most
importantly, you can't see what's inside their house.

You see, if you just want the zoom meeting to feel like
a big party, then, by all means, continue to use zoom.
After all, it's not like the company needs you anyway.
It can probably do just fine without a new client and
client meeting. And that's fine because that's all a
zoom meeting is for.

But if you want to feel good about the meeting, if you
want to do a good job and make your clients happy? You
need to find another way. And if you have to go around
looking for a better way then, boy, you need to get
your priorities in order.

And yes, a part of your job is meeting with clients and
making them happy, but it's not all you do. It doesn't
have to be all you do.

If you want to build a great company, you have to go
bigger than the conference room. And if you think about
it, your clients have probably already figured that out
for you, because the fact is you don't have a team of
clients. You have a team of people who need something
from you. Some of them need you because they want to be
with you and they have something to offer you. Some of
them are your mentors because they want to be helpful
to you in some way. Some of them have money, some of
them want to pay you, and some of them don't have a
penny to offer.

But there are no clients because there are no
clients. There is no Zoom. You have a team. And it's
not one big, happy family meeting. No one is going to
throw a party for you and your clients are not happy
either if they can't get what they want.

So stop being a zoom client and get a zoom room of your
own. Or better yet, stop being a zoom client and get a
home for your whole team. Your whole team is what you
get to build from scratch with your clients, so how does
your own home get more attention? It doesn't. There are
no more zoom clients when you decide to get a zoom
room, because everyone's at home, they can all be in
the same room at the same time.

So take your show on the road, do a zoom room or zoom
office, and let people in there know, you know, the
little details.

Make it a team and it will run a lot better. And you
won't even have to hire a receptionist because there's
no receptionist on board. It'll be so easy. Just look
at it like this:

What is your room/building? It's your team room.

Who is in that team room? Your entire team is in that
room.

What are they doing there? Helping each other, asking
and answering each other's questions and helping other
people.

What are you doing there? You're on stage, doing your
own thing. Your own work. And you're not there to be
busy, so you're no longer a zoom client.

What are they making? A product.

What are you making? Everything that's being made.
Anything that's being done. It's called a team.

Do you see how much it changes?

So if you can't even see why Zoom is so important, then
why would you want to make the effort to build it? It
takes the same amount of time to do a meeting in zoom as
it does to go to a home meeting.

And really, it takes the same amount of time to learn
Zoom as it does to learn how to speak a new language.
Because there are no words in a language that aren't
there already; your team already speaks the language of
Zoom.

You don't need to understand the zoom room at first.
Just walk into it and learn it as you go. It will
change and it will grow with you. And even if it isn't
your style right now, it will grow with you. Because it
is you.

If you have any questions, I'm here to answer them.
You can reach me any time and you don't have to pay a
single dime to get a hold of me if I'm out of town. I'm
always available to my clients. I'm not the team that
just waits for meetings to call them back. They aren't
waiting for me to send them links to the articles
they're supposed to send to their team. That just won't
work and isn't how this works. My whole business is to
be there for you. I don't get paid if you don't get
what you paid for. I don't send you an invoice unless
I can collect it and we've discussed the invoice before
then so I'm waiting for the money to show up on my
paycheck. And I don't do all this because I'm in love
with your money, but because I believe you deserve it.

If you need me, I'm here for you. All you have to do is
ask. If you need help or want to know more, I can tell
you more. If you want to help me help you, I can tell
you how to be a help to others, and how to get the
help you need.

You can go ahead and get the Zoom.com link and make the
payment from a phone call. So why would you even look
up my number? Because you don't need it because you
don't have to do it anymore and you won't ever have to
do it again, so you might as well get it out of the way.
If you want to stop paying me, that's fine. But what
are you going to do instead? You could spend your time
looking up things on the internet, just like this is a
book, you could look at a calendar and make appointments
on your calendar and make plans to get together
somewhere or spend your time making plans to pay me or
hiring someone else to manage your meetings. I've had
plenty of clients do that over the years.

It's your time.

It's your money.

It's your call.

But I hope you don't have to make any of those decisions.
You know what would be the smart thing to do? Pay the
membership. I'm sure you've got some money in your
investments account, so why not pay it now, get the
results you need today and start making plans for what
you can do with all that money you have instead?

If you really want to start something of your own but
you're not sure how, I can help you. You don't</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:31
