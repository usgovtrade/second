I have said elsewhere that the Japanese often seem to say that
nothing is very good, or very bad, without something equally so. I
was just thinking that it would be like them to say that nothing is
good, or bad, without something equally bad, or good. At least this
is a way of looking at the matter. They always seem to see something
at a disadvantage. Some people think that it is mere affectation.
Well, I suppose it may be in some cases, but I am inclined to think
that it is real, genuine feeling. Some one was telling me the other
day that Japanese was not so difficult a language to learn as it
used to be. Of course, the Japanese of our generation have had a
longer time to learn it, and the children of foreign professors have
been among the first learners. My informant himself was originally a
Russian scholar from Petersburg. What do you think that he said he
thought the most trying thing about the language was? What? That
you have to make almost as many different kinds of sounds as you
have letters to tell what you want to say. He had no trouble with
the sounds, but he said the thing that bothered him was having to
use so many different kinds of letters. However, I have not yet had
enough time with the language to make up my mind. I am only just
now beginning. In spite of all the difficulties I should say that
I thought there were about five or six classes in which it is quite
as easy as any other language. After one is through the alphabet
there is no more trouble.

_A Question of Pronunciation._ A question as to the method of
pronunciation--should one make the consonants in every word, or only
those that would stand for sounds in Japanese? Or should one make
all of the consonants when each syllable is read, or when the word
is spoken? One or two good friends have kindly told me their opinions
on this question, and, although I am far from a Japanese scholar,
I have thought of the matter. I think I shall go the way of the
English; that is, make every consonant in every syllable, because
it is more Japanese, in my opinion, and does not sound so strange
as the one that is supposed to be the correct way. However, I
think that most of the native teachers I have been told about do the
thing that the English do--read and pronounce all the consonants. In
that case we can never hope to use Japanese in Japan. But I am told
that all foreign people pronounce everything alike, and as they do
not care for distinction. To this some one replied that foreigners
are foreigners, and they have a right to go wrong. It is a matter
of taste. I shall follow the common custom of foreigners in Japan
which is not to pronounce the consonants in every syllable. In
Japanese that would not do. The reason is, I suppose, because the
consonants do not stand for sounds, but some other letters take
their place. That is why the difference in pronunciation does not
make any difference in the word. I know that some one in speaking
to you is speaking, and not just trying to say a certain letter.
In the same way the Japanese do not take the trouble to spell what
they want to say because their letters stand for other letters.
I expect that they pronounce the consonants as they do because
it is better to be like the Japanese, who say, "We pronounce like
this because this is our way." So it is, by the way, with the use
of the comma. The Japanese never use a comma, and that is because
theirs is a little different from ours.

_The Japanese Name._ There are two different ways of saying names
in Japan. Sometimes the name is said without an accent on any of
the syllables, as A-ri-ka. This is the first way. Sometimes the
whole name is accented, as Ara-kio-no-Kazuma. This is the second
way. Why the difference? It is an American question. The native
Japanese themselves do not seem to know. You might as well ask why
some call a house a "house" and others call it a "shanty." Each man
makes up his own way, and never inquires how it has been done before.
I suppose the native Japanese think that this accenting of syllables
makes the name more interesting and attractive. It gives it more of
an Oriental look. I am quite sure that foreigner, too, find it more
interesting that way.

_Difference in Direction._ When I wrote the other day that if the
Japanese were to come to America we would understand that they are
different from us, but they would not understand that we are different
from the Chinese, I forgot that the Chinese and Japanese were on
exactly opposite sides of the big island of Japan. It is a great pity
that there is not a big piece of land on which the two could meet
and understand each other. You can see in your geography books the
difference in direction. The Japanese way is the left hand way, the
Chinese way is the right hand way.

The same as a change of direction between countries is a change
in time. For instance, when you are coming home and you cross the
Hudson River the tide is coming in. That is, time and tide go up the
river. When they are going down they have not left New York. In Japan
it is the same. In Japan the sun goes down about 7:30 in the evening.
The sun has gone down in New York more than three hours, and we are
yet about five hours from the time that it goes down in Japan. It
is five hours different in time.

The Japanese way is by day; our way is by night, and as there is
no day and no night in Japan, they do not understand that we have
either the day or the night. In New York we say that we shall see a
night as soon as the sun goes down. In Japan they have no use for
such expressions. They would not know what we mean when we say that
the night is just coming. That is one of the things that we cannot
make them understand, but I suppose they know what we mean when we
say we shall be in Japan before the sun goes down. I am afraid there
are not many Japanese in New York, but there is a little circle
that are more like us, because the Japanese that one hears are not
generally able to speak our language.

_Rising and Falling._ In Japan they rise in the morning, and lie
down again when the sun goes down. If you want to know the time
you ask, "How many hours have passed since the sun went down?" The
answer is, "About seven." You cannot count the seven hours for the
Japanese have no names for hours. It is a part of the mystery of
their religion. In Europe we say the day is gone. But it is not as
difficult for a foreigner to learn as it might seem, if you try to
understand it. In our New York Sunday School they had a Japanese
girl to instruct the children in the study of the language. They
did not expect to learn much, but they succeeded so well that I do
not think that any of us knew that she had anything foreign about
her. The children of foreigners, however, have a very good deal to
say about the difficulty of being able to learn the Japanese language.
One boy was in the class. He was an American by birth, but his
father was a foreigner. He explained that the fact of his father's
birth having been in America seemed to be the only thing that saved
him. Otherwise he said he would never have known that he had anything
foreign about him. He said that as it was, some one gave him once a
piece of toast that had been put on the stove before being toasted.
"For that reason," he said, "I know that the Americans had been there
before the Russians." His teacher seemed to be a good deal puzzled.
Perhaps she had never heard of toast on the stove before, but she
said it would be possible that some one who had been abroad could
see that there was no reason why the toast should be black. For her
part she knew enough to be able to converse with the children, and
she was well understood by them. But she could not help being amused
at some of the things that they said about America. It will take a
long time to make it possible for Americans to speak Japanese, and,
in the meantime, they will have a hard time. One boy told us that
the Japanese and Chinese could not understand each other unless one
used the language spoken by the other, and so no other languages
would ever be used. So that he thought that the Japanese and Chinese
language would go out, and English alone would be used between all
foreign countries, and perhaps all the little towns might go back
to square-head English again.

It is much more difficult to tell what they would be able to say
than to make them understand what you are talking about. One of</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:38
