I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
everything." 
I said, "Well, it just solved my problem." 
She said, "I don't think you can go back and tell them you're not going to be 
going back to Egypt. 
They're going to think you're crazy now." 
"That's okay. I just have a lot to talk about. I need to go right now." 
Well, I was wrong. She was right. They did think I was crazy. 
They were really quite concerned. 
I said, "Well, you know, I went to Egypt, but what really happened is that 
the group of individuals you asked about just got killed at a bus stop." 
But it was going to be hard to describe that without sounding really crazy. 
So I had a difficult time as they were walking me down to the ward. 
At that time I didn't have a wheelchair, and had to try to make a deal with 
them to take me down, just for the transportation. I knew I couldn't move too 
quickly. 
When I finally got down to where I was going to stay at the children's ward, I 
was placed in a room by myself in a room with a bathroom, with a bed, with a 
stove in there. 
There was a bunch of girls and babies running around in the room. And a door, 
and the door had a little window in the door, like a window without glass, 
just a little window in it. And it was all that I could see through the 
window, and there was another window on the other side, where I could see the 
babies and girls running around. 
As soon as the door opened, all the children came in. 
And these were very young kids that had come from the community and from the 
community around, and they were running around just like any children will 
do. There was a little old lady, that came in with them. 
I didn't know if she was a patient or family, because she didn't know where to 
go or what to do. And she was standing at the door watching the children run 
around. And she said, "What's going on, doctor?" 
And I said, "It's a little crowded in here, you know, and they're just going to 
be a minute. Just go out there and let them play." 
She said, "Well, I don't know where they're supposed to go. You know, they're 
children. This is a hospital. We didn't bring our children here." 
And I said, "Look, I have to have this room. I have to have the room right now 
because it's a special room and it's supposed to be for kids with AIDS. It's 
called a children's ward. The room has to be by itself, away from adults. 
They're supposed to be separated. It's a special room. It is special for kids 
like you, and you have to be quiet and there's other people out there." 
She said, "I think it's a nice room." 
But she didn't know that the room wasn't for children and old people. It was 
a room for children with AIDS. 
And she said, "Well, I guess they can't keep them in there because if I bring 
my child in there, he's gonna mess it up." 
She kept saying over and over that she wanted to be by herself. "I didn't want 
to leave my child. I don't like him going off by himself. I want him with me. 
I want to keep him close. It's all a very big mess, and I don't want my child 
to be here. I want my child to go home." 
And I said, "Well, he can't go home. We just took him off of drugs so he's 
going to be here for a while. And I need the room." 
And she said, "But I'm going to have my child here." 
And she was not listening, like so many of these mothers will do. 
They say, "I'm going to have my child here." 
And the children are running around, and they've got babies on the bed, and 
they're all over. And she went out into the hallway and screamed out, 
"Look at my child! Look at my child!" 
And the other kids all gathered around and looked at him and started to cry. 
And she ran back in, and said, "I don't like you, I don't like you. You're not 
nice, you're not nice. I don't like you. You're going to have to leave." 
And she was so upset, I had to calm her down. 
I said, "That's the way it is. You have to understand. You have to understand 
what goes on. The doctors are going to take your child out so he doesn't have 
to be where you're living. He doesn't want to go in a place where he's being 
exposed to people who are sick. He doesn't want to go in there. But I can't 
let him stay with me. He can't go home. He can't go home." 
She cried and cried and cried and cried. 
I was beginning to realize just how many different things could go wrong in a 
moment. And these kids don't always know the medical reasons and stuff. 
I realized how hard it is for these families. 
And she went and she picked up a chair and she beat the chair against the 
wall, and she had never even been through the trauma of a death before. 
And she was crying because she was so upset. 
And then she came back to the bed and said, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." 
And then she was more upset about how much time I was spending with the other 
kid. She wanted the other kid. And then she went to the doorway again. 
And as I was telling her, I was in the corner because she had the door open, 
and I said, "Look. They're the ones that brought you here. It's not my fault. 
I don't know what to do. I can't take care of them. It's not my fault. I don't 
know what to do. I can't help you. I can't help you." 
And she said, "I want to come with you." 
And she said, "You don't understand. What's going to happen to me?" 
And she cried and cried and cried and cried. She said, "What's going to 
happen?" She said, "They won't feed me anymore." 
She started to cry, and I realized I'd probably just lost another patient 
because she was telling me she didn't want to be by herself. I'm thinking, 
maybe I'll just calm her down and we'll be all right. 
And I said, "Well, it's okay. We'll be all right." 
I went in and talked to the nurse, and I tried to explain. And the nurse 
called the doctor who was on duty that night, and she started to berate me. 
She said, "You are wasting my time. You're in here treating everybody but the 
patient." 
So I said, "Look, I'm sorry. I'll be quiet." 
I started talking to the mother and tried to calm her down. She wouldn't 
listen. I said, "I'm sorry. You're going to have to leave. I don't know how 
you do things here." 
She said, "You don't understand. I want my child here. I don't like him to be 
away from me. I'm going to be by myself, and I don't want to go. I just don't 
want to go." 
And I said, "Look, you've got to understand, I can't do anything for him. I 
can't feed him. I can't give him medicine." 
And I said, "I'm sorry. You'll have to go." And she started to get upset. And 
she started to get upset, and she started crying. And she said, "You're not 
being fair. I want my child here. You're going to have to change this rule." 
And I said, "Well, I'll try to change it. I'll try to change it, but I can't 
make you stay. You have to understand that I can't change anything right now. 
If I try, I'm just going to make it worse. You've got to understand this." 
And she said, "No." 
And I said, "Look, the longer we argue, the longer they're going to keep you 
here. They're going to have to get you fed. They're going to have to change 
your clothes. They're going to have to feed you. And if you keep crying, the 
doctor's going to want to give you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:06
