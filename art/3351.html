How's the job. Things going well for you?  The name of the lawyer is John

Write back and let me know how things are going.

Subject: Hi there!


Gerald:
 I am writing you at the suggestion of a mutual friend, Mark Toushek.  We
worked together at the Power Pool of Alberta and got reacquainted at a
professional golf tournament a few years ago.  I have since moved on to
Capital Power (a Canadian investment bank), and he is currently involved
with EES and moved to Portland.   I had an interesting conversation with him
about Enron (he doesn't really know me).  He said that his favorite part of
working there was the chance to acquire property for nearly nothing,
refurbish it, and then sell it (he did that about 10 times or so).   I
thought you would get a good kick out of that.

 I trust you are doing well and that you are settled in your new job.
Capital Power is very large and well respected on the Canadian investment
circuit.   I would imagine you hear plenty of Enron anecdotes around that
place.

 Mark mentioned you were still interested in the gas and power business, so
I was wondering if you were interested in what I do.  I head up a small
energy law firm specializing in negotiating power purchase agreements, gas
supply agreements, etc.  We are not large enough to represent a company as a
whole, but can do specific jobs and negotiate specific agreements.  I can
attest to our skills in these areas.  I know we have worked for Enron, one
time, and also for Enron subsidiary Williams Energy.   Let me know if this
might be of interest and I'll give you a call to discuss further.

Regards,
Bill</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:03
