This is the ultimate guide to building a successful convention. Get your free Kickstarter exclusive copy and start spreading the word.

With this pledge you get the PDF version (which means you'll get a discount on the finished product).

This pledge will unlock digital rewards in the pledge manager once the project reaches its goal. If you are in doubt, please send an email to brian@rebelpress.com for a final answer.

The full version of the Rebel Press RPG, complete with character sheets and handouts.

You get the PDF version, which means you'll get a discount on the finished product.

And then you get the PDF when it's finished. This is awesome, because I'm a lazy slob and this way I won't have to type up the full PDF anymore. Also, because it's been tested on over a dozen people now it should be pretty good.

Also, you'll get the full print, cut out, and paste in. This is awesome because I don't want to have to order the full version of the RPG from my printer for each con. This will solve that problem for you.

This is awesome. The book is so good I can't even begin to explain it.

You'll receive an additional PDF version with pictures, just for you. A picture is worth more than a thousand words in this case.

Shipping will be USPS 1st class/Media Mail for $5.50 USD.

You will also receive a hardback copy of The Rebel's Manual, but I'm working on the logistics of how that will work so please don't worry about that for now.
