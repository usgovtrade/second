So next we're going to 
do a plié. 
Okay, here is a basic 
standing plié, 
again, it's going to be 
with your working leg, 
just like I said, 
tuck your front foot in. 
Very nice, turn around and 
sit back down. 
And then here's a side view 
to make sure you have a full 
engagement here. 
You're not just coming up, 
you're actually putting in 
some effort. 
Nice work. 
This plié brings in the 
dance, remember? 
We've got all of these 
exercises bringing in 
dancing. 
Alright. 
Now that we've done all of 
that we can move on to a 
wonderful exercise that's 
just really basic and you 
don't even need an 
instructor to teach you this. 
It's a great exercise to 
challenge your muscles, 
especially if you've just 
started learning ballet and 
want to get all of your 
technique down. 
Okay. 
So it's a circle. 
All right. 
So we're just going to start 
out with a little bit of 
warmup and then we're going 
to find an empty space, okay? 
And then it's like you're 
taking a break. 
So just kind of find a 
break, find an empty space, 
and then make your first 
circle. 
Find an empty space. 
So how is that going? 
Nice. 
Nice, okay. 
So let's try again. 
Okay. 
So we've got to get better 
at this, okay? 
If you're having any trouble 
just stay in that empty 
space, the next time you try 
just focus on trying to find 
a more empty space to 
participate. 
Okay. 
So let's try it again. 
We just have to repeat the 
exercise. 
It's very simple. 
Find an empty space, take 
this whole thing and 
participate. 
Okay. 
So you're almost there. 
What did I tell you? 
To make the circle smaller. 
Okay? 
You're almost there. 
Okay. 
Find an empty space, but 
kind of small. 
Okay. 
Make your circle a bit 
smaller. 
Try again. 
Okay. 
So if you can just 
participate in this circle, 
it's a great exercise. 
Okay. 
It's going to have a big 
impact on your dancing. 
See you guys next week. 
BAM! 
[LAUGH] 
See you next week. 
Bye! 
>> Hi I'm Tanisha. 
I'm just a dancer here for 
about three years and I 
really love my instructors, 
but sometimes you're just 
like, "What else can I do?" 
And I like to exercise. 
But I like to stay true to 
ballet because I think it's 
just really important and I 
think a lot of other 
activities aren't going to 
challenge me in the same way 
as it does. 
But I do like running. 
And I feel like it's 
beneficial, but sometimes I 
just like to do cardio. 
My main goal is to be a good 
dancer, but I like to stay 
in shape. 
So I've been wondering like 
if I could make up a workout 
in my garage like a 
homeworkout or something? 
Does anybody have any good 
ideas on any routines? 
>> I mean, if you can't find 
it, I don't know where you 
are, you can make it. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> That's right, I have a 
problem with people getting 
into the barre, they have 
all this fancy ballet shoes 
and then they feel like they 
have to, well they have to 
come to barre class. 
The problem is here. 
And it's very easy to get 
away from it and it just 
kind of, the whole point 
gets lost and it becomes 
just like, "Okay, just barre 
class again, that's it." 
Now I'm starting to feel 
really bad about myself. 
But we'll talk about this, 
but do you understand? 
You need to make sure that 
you have shoes that have no 
support whatsoever and they 
have no heels. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Just any shoes at all, 
but we are trying to make 
sure that the shoes are no 
heels and no support and then 
you have to keep coming to 
the barre. 
That's what we're trying to 
do, let's put it into 
practice. 
All right? 
>> Nice. 
>> And in the end, let me 
assure you, that you're going 
to get such a great feeling 
when you're doing barre. 
>> Yeah. 
>> You won't believe it. 
It's really going to lift 
you up. 
You won't believe it. 
That's going to be the 
perfect thing, but we need to 
have a lot of commitment and 
just, yeah, we need to have 
commitment in order to get 
through this. 
>> Yep. 
>> Can you do it? 
>> [LAUGH] 
>> I'm going to go over 
heels and I've fallen on them. 
>> Oh. 
>> Can you do it? 
Do you have it? 
Like, do we have the problem? 
>> Well, yeah. 
>> Do you have the problem? 
Like, do you have it? 
>> All right. 
So to get rid of that, 
here's the real way, I'm 
going to show you the real 
way of getting rid of it. 
So the number one thing, we 
need to get rid of heels. 
So the best thing is to not 
ever wear heels. 
You need to have the shoes 
that you can dance in. 
>> But then my toes won't 
have to do so much work, 
right? 
>> No, it is going to be 
hard. 
You're going to be hard. 
It's going to hurt. 
So you need to have a solid 
shoe. 
But I'm going to teach you a 
way where you can still get 
the benefits of the, 
what's the word? 
Like, we're in a ballet 
class. 
>> The toe shoes. 
>> I'm sorry, toe shoes. 
And the toe shoes. 
And toe shoes. 
And toe shoes. 
And you just got to stand on 
it and you're going to keep 
taking the steps and you're 
going to keep going from toe 
to toe, toes to toes, toes to 
toes. 
And then when you get tired 
of toe you can switch to 
heel and you just got to keep 
changing it. 
That's what we have to do. 
Okay. 
So let's go do it right now. 
But we'll do it tomorrow. 
I'll stand here. 
I'm just going to show you. 
I want you to imagine. 
Come back here, okay? 
So we're at the ballet 
class, okay? 
>> Okay. 
>> Let me teach you 
something. 
>> Okay. 
>> Let me show you the thing 
that I show my students. 
Okay. 
So we're in a ballet class, 
right? 
And you need to do the 
exercise so you see what I'm 
saying. 
So we're standing here, 
right? 
>> [LAUGH] 
>> You see what I'm saying? 
So I'm going to take a front 
leg and you're going to stand 
on my foot. 
>> [LAUGH] 
>> You got it. 
>> You got it. 
>> [LAUGH] 
>> And then I want you to 
go under my legs. 
So you go under my legs. 
Under the leg, okay? 
Under my leg. 
Okay? </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:08
