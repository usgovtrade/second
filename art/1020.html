If you're a young person who can't afford Vigilante's regular summer camp programs and want to gain valuable experience, consider being a volunteer. This is a great way to show Vigilante your enthusiasm for the business and get real experience as well.

Apply to be a Volunteer:

Apply online or in person at the nearest Vigilante office. (Don't worry. There are no essays.) We ask you a few questions, you read the guidelines for the position you're applying for, and you go. You'll never be asked to pay for this kind of work.

As a Volunteer:

If you're accepted into a position you'll be trained on the job, including how to fill out the daily paperwork, answer the phone, record attendance, etc. You'll be part of a team of dedicated volunteers who give something back to the camp and to our community as well. And it's fun. No, really, it's fun.

It's easy to sign up:

All you need is an email and you're set. All staff are encouraged to accept applications from anyone and everyone because everyone has different strengths.

In exchange for your time, we'll give you:

A unique experience you can use to stand out to employers

Access to an amazing learning environment at Vigilante summer camp

An unforgettable experience with great friends you can keep in touch with for years to come

The chance to volunteer is really free. You can volunteer as much or as little as you want to. Volunteers typically work a day or two a week in their area of interest. All of our volunteers get training in how to do the job, so you'll be as helpful as possible. Volunteering is a great way to see how the company runs, to see what you'd be doing, and to see the inner workings of Vigilante.

As a counselor:

As an intern in the program, you'll gain the experience of a counselor. You'll be able to learn how to perform the day-to-day responsibilities of a counselor, including the ability to interact with children. You'll be able to perform the most common duties a counselor needs to know, like providing breakfast, lunch, or dinner, as well as morning or afternoon activities. Our counselors receive professional training for their job, but they get the chance to learn the things that they're often not given in a normal counseling setting, like CPR training, CPR certification, and many more job-related skills. You'll get to show your friends what a counselor does and how they make a difference at camp. There is no better way to show your parents what you're interested in and how they can help you with it.

Get the opportunity to know what to look for when interviewing for your first job and how to handle interviews and applications. It's all in your training, so don't worry.

Camp counselors need to be active in sports and able to handle an active camp environment. You will be supervised by a camp counselor at all times. We provide on-site orientation, first-aid training, CPR training, and supervision from camp administration and staff. In addition, the camp staff will be supervising you while you take a practice test.

As a camper:

As a camper, you'll have a different experience than any of our counselors. That's why your placement is a special privilege. You will have the same fun and challenging experience as any other counselor and will be considered an employee and full partner in the summer camp family. You'll receive training and supervision from the day you arrive and become a part of the team. No experience necessary.

As a Volunteer:

The Vigilante camp volunteer will be expected to assist with all camps including transportation, registration, on-site supervision, camp set-up, clean-up, and much more. There is no experience necessary and we're happy to accept volunteers who have different talents or skill sets. Camp counselors who volunteer to work at a camp gain experience in how camp operations run and get the opportunity to meet other campers and counselors. Campers who volunteer at a Vigilante summer camp have a great experience to put on their college applications as well. So far, Vigilante has built a volunteer program that includes a "volunteer network" of Vigilante volunteers who like to work together and are willing to give back.

As a camp counselor, your role is to engage, listen, lead, and connect. Your daily activities include the following:

Setting a positive tone at the beginning and ending of camp.

Leading activities that meet kids where they are - whether it's playing outside, dancing, drama or other arts, sports, or even sports-themed crafts.

Developing and maintaining a strong, supportive relationship with the campers.

Organizing camp activities, including events and games

Meeting with individual campers and families and providing them with an appropriate level of supervision.

Working with your crew members to support the positive experiences of campers

As a counselor, you'll do all of the things you see at camp:

You'll help and listen to campers so they feel comfortable

You'll have fun as a camper too!

Your experience can count on your college or university application. You will have the experience of camp for free, and you'll have the opportunity to use skills that employers look for like teamwork, working with others, and being responsible.

It's never too late to get started - there's a counselor needed at each age group. There are many more things you can learn from camp than just how to play a sport. You'll learn what to look for when interviewing for your first job, how to handle interviews and applications, how to get along with different people, and so much more. It's never too early to start. This is an amazing opportunity for every camper, and one of the best memories you can have! The more you volunteer for Vigilante, the more you learn how to handle different situations.

We believe that all people have a fundamental right to quality, life-affirming, recreational, educational and enrichment opportunities in the United States. Our programs open the doors for people to make better choices and make better futures for themselves.

A week at camp can truly be life-changing. You'll make new friends, gain valuable experience, and have a fantastic time all in the same week.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:20
