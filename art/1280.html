I went to the studio, like every night for 12 years, from 12 till, like, 35, and then I just left my band. I gave up all of my day jobs. I don't miss a thing, ever. I really just think about who I am as an artist and how I want to create things. Just about trying to stay in the present, stay in the moment, have fun. And you know, people don't take that seriously. You know, what I do for a living is make music. You know? Like, this is what I do, and it's not supposed to be all these other things. So it was a really really fun journey for me. I'm not gonna take it seriously. I'm just going to make it what it is, you know? I don't have time for anything else. Like, not like "I'm just here to have fun". I mean, sometimes you can make it your job and take it too seriously. That's not what this is."
