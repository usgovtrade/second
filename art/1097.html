I am no O.J. expert, nor have I written extensively about the O.J. case. Therefore, the above information may be wrong, or incomplete. However, it is true that O.J. Simpson was eventually found not guilty for murdering his ex-wife and her friend on June 17, 1994.

Bonus Facts:

The O.J. Simpson murder trial was one of the most watched and widely reported trials, if not the most watched. It gained wide-spread coverage throughout the world and there was even an international blackout to deny the press coverage over the murder of Nicole Simpson.

The O.J. Simpson murder trial was the most watched in history, with most sources putting the viewership numbers anywhere from 50-100 million people, in the United States alone, at least.

O.J. Simpson’s lawyer Alan Dershowitz was widely heralded as the “Defense attorney of the Century”. The legal term “genius” was also used, with many observers suggesting it was Mr. Dershowitz, and not Mr. O.J. Simpson, who was the “genius” who was actually behind his trial defense.

O.J. Simpson was an American professional football player and was a running back for the Buffalo Bills in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 years.

O.J. Simpson was voted to seven Pro Bowl games during his career.

Simpson’s reputation for “taking a blow”, and not getting knocked out, is likely what caused him to avoid being knocked out from multiple blows to the head in the infamous “Trial of the Century” at the murder trial for his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.

For the legal, and sometimes technical, terminology of O.J. Simpson’s trial, see O.J. Simpson’s Criminal Trial.

O.J. Simpson was found “not guilty” of the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman on June 17, 1994. However, O.J. was later arrested and charged for armed robbery, kidnapping and assault in an unrelated incident.

O.J. was sentenced to prison, with multiple reports stating it was somewhere around nine to ten years. However, he was released in 2005.

There were a number of rumors of O.J.’s having a “ninja style” fight training technique, as well as a report of his using his hands as little more than a “fist” to deliver blows.

O.J. was known to use the phrase “in-between” as a euphemism for “nothing” throughout his trial.

O.J. was known to practice a variety of different martial arts, including karate, tae kwon do and other such training methods.

An FBI agent of African descent, Thomas R. Vernor, was called to the stand during O.J. Simpson’s trial to discuss his investigations into the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.

During the trial, there were rumors of the case and the evidence being so overwhelming that Simpson could be a serial killer and it could also be speculated that he would be found not guilty. O.J. reportedly told his friend Robert Kardashian that the jury would “have no choice but to find him not guilty” if they were to find him guilty.

O.J. is believed to have been paid the sum of one million dollars to play in a single game of golf, which was for an insurance policy he took out with Nike, where he was also the face of their golf promotion campaign.

A year before he would go on to be found “not guilty” for the murder of his ex-wife and her friend, O.J. Simpson told Sports Illustrated’s Peter Richmond:

“Sometimes I think I’m the smartest man alive, sometimes the dumbest.”

When asked by the media what it was like to have the famous quote “If I did it, I would have done it with gloves on.”, O.J. stated that he made the statement because he was angered that he was going to give a television interview at a party, and another man told him he “looked like a deer in the headlights.” He also stated that he often used the phrase in everyday life.

O.J. was an enthusiastic weightlifter, with one report stating that he had an 18 inch neck, and 7 inch wrists.

O.J. worked with a trainer that was not only well known for his prowess in martial arts, but he was also well known for training professional athletes.
