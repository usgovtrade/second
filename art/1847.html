I can't wait to see it when it's on tap. I got excited and took my shirt off to cool down," Kaufman said, according to his Twitter account.

But after that, the show took a turn toward the adult.

"Fellows, I do not condone any form of nudity, so you will just have to imagine it," the bar posted on its website, along with the photo of the men and their partially naked forms.

The photo was taken in New York City by photographer Justin Jaworski, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. He later said the men's idea of getting "closer to the beer" was his idea.

"It was an inside joke because there are so many ads of men in swim trunks with long necks," Kaufman said. "We were trying to get the look of a long-necked beer, but at the same time, we're naked.

"I think when we walked out, I was the last one," he said. "I thought it was hilarious. It's just different. We have a sense of humor about it."

The event has turned into something of a cult meme.

"To the 'art' of the 'Belly' at the 'Taps' on 79th, the world is your (beer-tasting) oyster!" tweeted Gabe Vosburg.

"I could not love that even if I tried," wrote Tom Hintz, about the "Belly" photo. "All my favorites in one photo."

The reaction has ranged from fascination to amusement to disbelief.

"I'd go there, but never in my undies," wrote Dave Barboza. "Can you imagine a beer pouring over your head?!"

"I don't think he drank his beer, because he was so hot," wrote Kevin Jones.

"I guess it takes some imagination to create a work of art," said a commenter from Facebook.

One person who did go said he'll never forget the experience.

"I was a bit disappointed at the belly, but what the hell," said Jeff Olsen of Chicago. "Then to see the boys in the front of the crowd that had been selected for that moment to make the belly.

"It was absolutely amazing. The bartenders and servers all took great pride in what was going on. They knew how it looked, but understood its all in fun."

Kaufman said his friend who posted the photo didn't post it to be funny.

"I know it's funny, but at the time, it wasn't planned," he said. "I just saw a black box of Bud Light beer with a straw coming out of it."

But, he added, "For the rest of the day, people would ask me about the belly."

After the photo shoot, the men made the rounds, drinking with customers and posing for pictures.

They all say they enjoyed the experience and "Belly" will remain an indelible part of their bodies of work.

"The 'Belly' definitely sticks with me," said Justin, who said he's from St. Louis. "It might not be everyone's idea of art, but that's how we're wired.

"Everyone is getting a piece of the 'Belly' this summer," he said. "My belly is out there."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:36
