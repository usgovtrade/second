We asked The Art of Marriage expert Tom Rath what was the most surprising discovery he learned while researching this subject. Here’s what he said:

“I was stunned at the amount of research and the number of books that were available on this subject. Some of them were written by ‘experts’ who weren’t even married! A couple of other research projects, such as one conducted by the Barna Research Group, actually showed that a person’s happiness can be negatively affected when they become too ‘successful.’ What?! Is success bad? What if you have to go on stage and make a speech in front of a lot of people? Will that make you unhappy? As it turned out, my hypothesis that becoming successful could be a ‘ticking bomb’ for a marriage was incorrect. It turns out that ‘success’ and ‘failure’ are not the variables that contribute to a great marriage, but rather the level of commitment a person shows to their spouse and their willingness to serve and sacrifice for their spouse. So, please don’t sell your marriage short to reach your goals.”

It is time to put down the career papers and the parenting journals. Go on a date, and let us know if it works.

And please don’t think that because you are single that your mate is also unhappy. In fact, if you’re reading this, it is quite possible that your spouse has read this book and is smiling. There are just as many happily married people as there are happily single people. A study by Dr. John Gottman of the University of Washington showed that married couples who had happy marriages were equally happy regardless of whether they were single or not. It is how we make the choices we do, and how our choices impact our happiness that shapes who we are.

Have fun with that. It won’t be easy, and no one expects it to be. But it just might work.

“We have never loved a book so much as the Bible itself. It would be quite as absurd to attempt to love the Bible as it is written without loving the Person who wrote it as He whom it reveals” (Frederick Brotherton Callender, Bible Facts and Their Significance).

I know, I know, it’s hard to picture the great preacher Frederick Brotherton Callender as a “man of little faith”! But I think most people would agree that this book was the most meaningful in our family during the three years it was a required text for one of my Sunday school classes.

Fred Callender is one of my heroes. He is considered to be one of the best Bible teachers in the history of Christian preaching. His writings on the Holy Spirit, in his classic book An Interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, are an inspiration to this day. In this book he writes about the Person who inspired it all: God Himself.

Fred has a way of speaking from the heart, in that deep, resonating voice that so many of us have known from our childhood and from our parents. He takes us back to the earliest days of our faith, when God was calling prophets to go up on the hills to pray for their own nation, a nation that was headed for destruction.

Of course we’ve all heard of Moses, but I learned so much about the great man Elisha, who led King Jehoshaphat’s army into battle when they faced overwhelming odds. The story of how God healed the captain of the band and Jehoshaphat’s servant is fascinating. I never thought that story would ever be found in a book of the Bible!

Abraham is not the hero of this book, but his spiritual faithfulness to God is one of the most inspiring aspects of this story.

Fred is a wonderful example of a man who knows that the purpose of man’s life is not to be great, but to be small and obedient to God. For Fred, this meant living each day in obedience to God’s call upon his life. What an inspiration!
