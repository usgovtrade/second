Gameteknology is happy to announce that the TETRIS theme has been updated, as well as the release of three new game packs!

The newest update for our TETRIS theme is the addition of 10 new backgrounds that add a modern flair to the traditional game. The first pack consists of three new backgrounds: “Petal Rock” by tlumacher, “Blue Slices” by pugna, and “Soul Of Glass” by tlumacher. The second pack consists of four backgrounds: “Tall Trees”, “Wicked Clouds”, “Fantasy”, and “Twilight”, and the final pack consists of three new backgrounds: “Waves In The Sea”, “Dusty Desert”, and “Crystal Trees”. Each of these backgrounds are available in JPG format and will work with any existing TETRIS theme, so make sure to grab them while they’re still on the site! We have also added support for M.U.G.E.N, which means there are a total of 25 high-quality user-made maps available for the game. If you enjoy any of the backgrounds or maps, don’t hesitate to rate them and leave your comments on the forums or in the dedicated channel.

We have also released new game packs.

Tetris Game Pack 1 contains 35 levels for a whopping total of 3550 blocks, a very nice start to any new game. The pack contains five new backgrounds: “Gnome Village”, “Crystal City”, “Giant Castle”, “Oriental Tile”, and “Snowy Forest”.

The second pack contains 17 levels for 1000 blocks. All five of the backgrounds are exclusive to this pack and will work with any existing theme. These will be especially nice for new players.

The third pack contains eight levels for 450 blocks, the smallest of our packs but not the one lacking in challenge! Like the other packs, these are exclusive to this pack and will work with any existing theme.

As usual, each of these packs can be purchased individually for $2.99. We have also improved the game creation process. We now feature a template creator that makes making a level much easier and more fun, all you need to do is specify the grid size and click ‘Create’, and the template will be automatically inserted at the right location. To get a better idea of how easy it is to create a level, check out this video tutorial:

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or bug reports, we urge you to head to the dedicated forums for this theme.
