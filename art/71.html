He then offers the following: "if a computer program is damaged, it is not a problem of hardware - the program is the hardware and the hardware remains pristine.  If the program is modified, then the hardware will be modified automatically because the hardware cannot be the software. This is similar to the analogy of the ship which is the hardware and the software is the crew; they don't live and work together and share the same space."  Dr. Jones ends his explanation with the following: "we do not need to do anything, but we need to be willing to do whatever is required to fix the software."    We feel the analogy is fitting, yet a little far fetched.

Solving the world's problems? 

Some have seen our existence as the solution to the world's problems and we as God in the shape of the human being, being the catalyst to the universe itself.  As we have been discussing, time is the most important asset that we have and the greatest force for creating our existence, the past as well as the future.  It's our responsibility to take advantage of what time offers in order to live it to its fullest potential, or we have failed as a human.  
  
How can we live life to its fullest?  Time is the source of everything, and there is nothing better than being in the presence of the one who created it all.  It is through time, which is the present, that we have the opportunity to experience all that is possible.  It is through time that we can be in the here and now, which is the past, present, and future.  The ability to experience all three in one place at once is one of the great miracles of time, but we as humans have yet to master it.  If we are to live fully in this reality, we must master it.  It is through this mastery that we can have our past, present, and future all at the same time in the same present, that is the present.  This is the only way to live the fullness of time.  We must master the present to be able to enjoy the presence of the past and future.  There is no more important gift that time has to offer than being in the presence of the creator.  If we don't know who we are, we can't become who we were meant to be.  
  
"It is not possible to be wise for an entire life, but one can live a wise life, and that is what is most important."  
  
If we have the courage to learn, life becomes a journey of discovery, and we grow as people through our journey.  Life is a process of discovery and each step we take on our path becomes an insight to the next step.  Our existence is dependent on our understanding and our growth, so if we fail to learn, we cannot grow.    The ability to learn is one of the greatest gifts time has to offer, and our greatest strength.  We just have to learn what to learn.  

Chapter One.3

"In his eyes there is only knowledge"

- Albert Einstein  
  
The only absolute truth is:  "You can't reason people out of a position they didn't reason themselves into."  
  
The only way we can learn anything is through the process of thinking.  The only way to think is to be in a position that requires us to think.  This is one of the reasons why we believe that all life starts in the mind.  Everything we can think of, is what we can eventually be and understand.  
  
The best people are those who know a lot of things and who learn constantly.  They see things differently than everyone else and their different vision helps them to learn.  It is only through learning that we can be a learner ourselves, and we are our own best teacher.  If we have a vision, we can make it so, if we have a dream, we can make it so.  
  
In his eyes there is only knowledge, not wisdom or understanding.  This is the way we learn, and it's the only way to learn.  We learn with the mind and through the process of thinking.  Life is learning and it's the only way we can live it.  
  
Chapter One.4

When the mind is at peace, it creates more peace, and when the mind is at rest, it creates more rest, and when the mind is in harmony, it creates more harmony.  
  
A peaceful mind will show more of a peaceful heart.  A well-rested mind will create more rest and relaxation.  A harmonious mind creates more harmony, and a happy mind creates more happiness.    The body shows, but the spirit shows more, because it's what the mind cannot see that makes the greatest impact on the body.  
  
As it's in the spirit that the body lives, it's in the mind that the body learns.  Learning is the essence of our existence, and it's through the process of learning that we can enjoy the fullness of life.  

Chapter One.5

Life is one big test, and we all have to learn about living in the spirit.  

Life is not a test, we are.  We are the ones who are putting the test together.  It is not a test that we have to pass.  It's a test that we have to fail to learn that we have failed.  

We are the ones who give meaning to it all.  We choose to believe that life is either a test or not, and we then choose how we interpret it.  When we can understand that our meaning to life is more about what we are than about what we do, we will experience life in a very different way.  

"Where there is life, there is a reason for it all, and where there is a reason for it all, there is always purpose."

- George Harrison

Life is purposeless, we are purposeless, and our existence is purposeless.  Yet, we exist, and we exist in the most incredible way.  There is nothing like the existence of the human being.  We know that and we feel it every day.  
  
Why do we exist?  Why do we create?  Why do we do what we do?  There is no life without purpose, but it is our purpose that drives us to the point where we can say we have purpose.  

Why do we create?  Because it's our only means of survival.  If there is no purpose, life can not exist.  If there is no reason, life can not exist.  If there is no life, there is no meaning, and if there is no meaning, life is not worth living.  If there is no meaning in life, there is no purpose and if there is no purpose in life, we would not have created.  If we create, then we exist and if we exist, we create.  If we create, we learn to survive, and if we learn to survive, we create and if we create and learn, we create a purpose in life.  

The way we see and define reality depends on what we believe in.  It doesn't matter if we're talking about the physical, the spiritual, or the emotional.  What matters is what we choose to believe.  

If we believe that reality is what we see, and that reality is what we believe, then reality is what we make it to be.  If we see a reality, that is not reality, then we believe in that reality and we believe that reality.  If we believe in reality, then reality is what we believe in, and we create reality for ourselves.   

Life is not a battle, but it's a war, and we're either ready to fight or we're not.  If we're not ready, we don't take the chance to fight.  If we're ready, then we fight because life isn't about surviving, it's about winning.  

All of us have our unique perspective, and none of us will agree on all of it.  When there is only one reality, we all believe it, and when there are different realities, we all have a different opinion.  In our reality, we have a different opinion of each other and we have a different opinion of ourselves.  In order for us to learn to see other people's reality as our own, we must believe it, and we must accept it.  We must understand the truth that only what we believe to be true is real.  We have to believe that what we see, hear, touch, taste, smell and feel is real or we can not see, hear, touch, taste, smell and feel anything else.  

All of us are a combination of past and future.  We have a past and we have a future, and those things are the foundation of our existence.  We experience our existence in the past and we experience our existence in the future, yet the past and the future are only a part of what we are, we are a combination of past, present, and future.  

If we can understand that we are nothing more than the combination of a past, present and a future, we will find that we are much less than we think.  We are the combination of a past, present, and a future.  Our past experiences create our present, and our present experiences create our future.  

If we truly understand what we are, then we will begin to understand how the past, present and future can all come together and create a unique expression of ourselves.  If we can learn how to see our past, present and future as a unique expression of ourselves, then we can truly understand the meaning of life.  We will find that what we experience as one, is part of who we are as much as what we have done.  

Chapter One.6

If you could experience yourself in your past, would you still have the same purpose you have now?  If you could experience yourself in the future, would you still have the same purpose you have now?   
  
If you were to experience yourself in your past, you would feel like you don't know who you are.  You would not be able to define the purpose of your life or know how you got to be who you are now.  You would not know who you are, but you would know who you think you are.  

If you were to experience yourself in your future, you would feel like you don't know where you're going.  You would be lost.  You would be so overwhelmed with the possibilities that you don't know where to go.  You would not know where you're going, but you would know where you're going to go.  

There is only now, there is only now.  There is only here, there is only here.  There is only what we can see and hear, but there is only now.  There is only here, there is only here.  There is only what we can touch, feel and see.  There is only now.  There is only here.  There is only what we can taste, smell and hear.  There is only now.  There is only here.  There is only what we can create and create and create and create and create and create and create and create.  There is only now.  There is only here.  

If we could see ourselves from both our past and future, then we would understand what we are and what we can do.  The reason we have both past and future is because we can see and feel and taste and smell.  That's what we can do.  The reason we can do those things is because we're alive, and that's what we are.  If we didn't experience ourselves as being alive, we couldn't experience our past and future.  If we couldn't experience our past and our future, then we couldn't experience ourselves, we would just be part of the emptiness.  If we could not experience ourselves as alive, then we would not be able to feel, touch, taste, smell, create, or enjoy the fullness of life.  

Life is fullness, there is no emptiness.  Life is a blessing.  Life is a miracle.  Life is a miracle.  Life is a blessing.  Life is a blessing.  Life is a blessing.  Life is a blessing.
