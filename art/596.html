The material, when added to concrete, can act as an insulating barrier that lowers the conductive properties and reduces thermal transmission. When mixed into a concrete mix, it could essentially be used to re-create the properties of perlite or vermiculite, which are used as fillers in concrete.

"Now that we know what graphene can do for concrete, we can look for ways to actually engineer it into our structures," said Dr. Markus Antonietti, in a release from Concrete Network. "It's too early to say if it's worth all the hype, but I think it's safe to say that graphene is a breakthrough discovery. It definitely holds promise to revolutionize many aspects of concrete technology."

Graphene is essentially a one atom thick material that is nearly transparent. Because of its high thermal and electrical conductivity, it's also a great shielding material. But in the mix, graphene can serve as an insulator. The material could possibly be used to enhance concrete for insulating purposes and with high temperatures.

"This is a great material," said Professor David Geurts of Texas Tech, one of the researchers to study it. "We see this as a new application of a material that has great promise."

If graphene is used to help create a barrier between concrete and electrical wiring, concrete could be used in power lines. Also, this discovery could make for less concrete waste by improving its insulation properties.

"From a practical point of view, this makes more use of the concrete, which is a good thing because you want to use less of it," Antonietti told the BBC.

Graphene can also be made to react to temperature fluctuations. So far, the material has been demonstrated to remain stable through 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632 degrees Fahrenheit).

Graphene will not be an easy fix, but it will be another way that technology is being used to help increase concrete's durability and longevity. In this case, graphene could also be used to strengthen structural integrity in buildings. Scientists are also looking at whether it could be used to improve fire resistance properties.

Concrete companies are trying to find new products for the material and looking to make it more recyclable, according to the BBC. It may have more uses to find than scientists can imagine, which is why it might be hard to predict the future of concrete for years to come.
