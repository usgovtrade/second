Biorhythms.

Toxicity levels in body.

Biorhythms are rhythms of living organisms that correspond with various body
functions, especially in terms of metabolism, nervous activity, endocrine
activity, and sleep-wake cycle. While cycles of about two weeks do exist,
within a twenty-four hour period there are also shorter cycles occurring at a
frequency of eight to fifteen times a day. These cycles can help reveal
changes in our body with good reason.

I suggest you to pay a lot of attention to this kind of things.

You need to check toxic exposure levels.

The toxicity levels in the body are influenced by many things, but in general
the main sources are your diet, water and air, medications, and general
chemical exposure.

A lot of people don't have these tested, because it's expensive to do that.
You can do this at home by yourself, by doing a urine test at home, a hair
test at home.

You need to read
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis)
for more info on that.

Don't worry if you have no idea about what those mean. Do what's necessary.

And finally, if you want to do more, I suggest to take a look at the
following book:

The Sync Method - http://www.amazon.com/The-Sync-Method-Science-Innovation/dp/1576696604/

[http://www.amazon.com/The-Sync-Method-Science-
Innovation/dp/...](http://www.amazon.com/The-Sync-Method-Science-
Innovation/dp/1576696604/)

And, the original site which suggests this:
[http://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/science/the-sync-
method-...](http://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/science/the-sync-method-by-
mark-golden/),

Also, you may find this interesting:
[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca2.htm...](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca2.html)

Here is also a good resource for meditation practice.

[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sutta/sn_7_07/08.h...](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sutta/sn_7_07/08.html)

I find it so sad, when there are very qualified and capable and great
teachers, but none of them know how to share this with the world.

In many cases it's more about marketing for them.

If they have teachings of such a high standard, which they are confident are
true, then why don't they share them openly, openly?

Here's a suggestion on how to know if your teacher is the real deal, how to
know when you need to trust them, and what to do when you get an unpleasant
reception from someone claiming to be enlightened.

[http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/wp-
content/uploads/20...](http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/wp-
content/uploads/2015/11/Knowing_Enlightenment.pdf)

The best teacher is the one you trust, the one you can connect with, the one
who can keep you open.

I would like to know what the actual source for this is.

I've seen some "new age" information around the web about the body and the
universe - but I haven't been able to find much scientific information that
shows concrete reasons for why these concepts could have a basis in reality.

I do have a strong interest in understanding how the universe, the physical
reality and consciousness are all interwoven. I'm aware that that there could
be some scientific basis behind how this happens.

But most of the material I've come across so far is either vague, or has
sources from the same kind of individuals as this one.

Maybe we should check out the other "elixirs" (if you can call them that) in
that story too...

It's called "The Matrix" (and the elixir is called Red Pills).

    
    
        [Red Pills]: "The red pill is the realization that things aren't what they appear to be."

When I saw a headline I recognized (because of its very presence on HN - I'm
slightly embarrassed to admit I follow every single link to HN from here), I
automatically assumed it was a parody of the _XKCD_ comic about the health
"elixir" (the "Red Pill"), so I had no reason to click. It's unfortunate that
I missed the _XKCD_ reference here.

(I'm not trying to dismiss this article, as it's great content for anyone
looking for a new approach to life.)

That was a bad assumption.

That was about the least credible web site I have ever seen. I would have to
worry that this information is fake and there is no way to find out if this is
a hoax. This also undermines the credibility of the entire blog!

It's more credible than most "scientific" websites (e.g. National Geographic,
PBS, the Discovery Channel, etc.)

I agree

Weird article, but it does make some good points.

I have no idea where this comes from, but the idea of changing your body as
you age has been around a while.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbaum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbaum)

[http://www.alternativemed.com/health/aging-b-r-ingers-no-
jou...](http://www.alternativemed.com/health/aging-b-r-ingers-no-journal-ever)

...which sounds like a bit of pseudoscience. But it sounds reasonable. There
are compounds that may, as we age, have an effect on muscle tone and
functionality, for instance.

If you want to be a completely different person, you have to become _un-_
_human_. This involves a change of nature; becoming less vulnerable, less
attached, less afraid, less emotional, less social, less sexual, etc.

This is essentially becoming an alien life form.

I have no idea if you can consciously become alien. I doubt it, given that the
cure for our humanity is literally being alien to ourselves (by killing your
ego, for instance). However it sounds like there are steps you can take to
help remove those flaws and imperfections you hate so much about yourself.

>you have to become un-human.

Human means the ability to feel emotions, to be sensitive and emotional. Being
"human" is an inherent flaw. I hate feeling sad or upset, so I shouldn't be
