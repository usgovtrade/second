On my side, I do not want you to be seen to be betraying me. As my bodyguard, if you do such a thing, people will say that I brought you with me, that I hired you. They will wonder why you did not say a word to stop me. You know my plans better than anyone. They will assume I did not think you had the courage to stop me. You are a man with a family, Domenico. Is it so terrible to be seen to be protecting me?"

"I will arrange for you to be seen," Domenico told her. "It is all I have ever wanted. I will make it happen. You, though, I will not make look like you are hiding your face. No, I cannot make that seem possible."

Lena laughed. "You would have to do a bit more than that. I am a respectable woman. The truth is I would never hide from that!"

She did not miss the look of delight that came over his face. Then his face turned stern again.

"I must have your word that you will not speak to anyone of my plans. If you try, I will see that you get back safely to your family."

Lena was relieved. She knew that she was the only one who could set things right. "I give you my word," she promised. "In this, you must trust me."

Domenico looked at her a long time, weighing her words. Lena could tell from the look on his face that he was still not convinced. "Let me ask you something," she suggested. "Who do you think would want the castle for himself? Who would have it?"

"Many of the nobles have their eyes on the castle. Some have even bribed their way inside. There are no secrets inside a place like this. There is no way for any of them to get the castle if I was not here."

"They have been coming for it for years," Lena told him. "It does not matter whether I was here or not. If I leave, there is a trail of bodies behind me. There is only one person I could imagine wanting to become our new lord of the castle. Maybe he would even give you a job. Do you know who I am talking about?"

Domenico didn't hesitate. "I know who you are talking about, my lady. He would love the castle. Who is it?"

"Her name is Lidia D'Ambrogio. She lives over in Venice, down in Taranto."

"Venice is a dangerous place. How would a woman like that have made her way here without being seen? How would she have known about us? Or was it she who sent you? Has she some sort of mark?"

"It has nothing to do with her!" Lena assured him. "I met her when I was traveling with my mother and uncle. She is my cousin."

"And does she have a husband?"

"She does," Lena told him. "But she does not live with him. She lives by herself. I would not tell you about her if it wasn't true. I would not do you any harm, Domenico."

Domenico considered her words. "What is it you need from me?"

"The keys. I need to get inside. I will arrange for you to see the castle."

"I still do not understand why you are willing to do something so dangerous," Domenico said. "You will see that we are watched at every corner."

Lena knew he wanted to help her, but he would not do so until he was convinced there was no risk.

"I promise I will not be seen. All you have to do is watch. It is as you say, they all expect me to be inside, because I am always inside, when someone comes for the castle."

Domenico wanted to say something, but he could not. Lena knew he would be thinking of someone else who did not behave in such a careful way.

"It's nothing, my lady," Domenico said instead. "I will do as you ask."

"You say that as if you will not be there to watch my back. That is what I want."

"And will you give me a sign when it is done? If I am here, you will know what I have done."

Lena nodded. "I will tell you."

"You have my word. That is all you need from me. I will watch and tell you everything."

Lena and Domenico exchanged a look. They both knew the risk they were taking.

## Chapter Ten

## Taranto

HENRY STOOD UP from where he had been sitting near the entrance to the great hall. All around him, people were seated at the long benches, drinking, eating, telling stories. He had been bored and had wanted to go find Nico, who had gone to the stables with Henry's servant to see the horses. But he could not just leave. It would look suspicious. After all, everyone had heard the rumor that the Prince was going to move his household to the castle, and he had been sitting in the great hall, looking lost and confused. When the steward approached, he sent Nico to find out if the rumor were true.

Henry was bored and he wanted to get something to eat, but then Nico came rushing up to him.

"They have made him Lord of the Castle!" Nico whispered.

"Why?" Henry whispered back.

"Something happened in Rome," Nico told him. "He is getting sent away because he is no good for anything else."

"What happened?" Henry asked.

"Don't know," Nico answered. "They said the Pope was angry and dismissed him."

Henry thought of his father and what they had said of the Prince. "He would fit in very well here," he said.

Nico knew what Henry meant.

"You go and find out where they are keeping him, so we can sneak in and see the castle," Henry told him.

Nico shook his head. "I will not," he answered. "If I did that, I would be in even more trouble than you. I am still supposed to be the man to talk to you."

"Don't want to go in there anyway," Henry agreed. "I want to see the castle from the other side."

Nico shook his head again. "Even if you can do it, no one will see you, but you."

Henry gave in. "You stay here and keep an eye out for me," he told Nico. "After a little while I will find you."

Nico nodded. He was curious, but Henry had always been able to make him do as he asked. After he did what Henry said, he would always come running back.

Henry left the great hall and found a doorway that was less crowded. He walked through it and came out on the outer side of the castle, looking at the walled garden. He glanced over to the hill to the north of the castle, where the tower stood. He thought the view there might be good and decided to go up there, see if he could see anything.

Henry was just walking away when he heard a voice behind him, "He looked lost, don't you think?"

Henry turned around to see the steward who had been to see him and Nico. He recognized him because he had brought the message from England about when the Prince was leaving.

"Is that the best you have to offer?" the steward asked. "You must be proud of your work."

Henry was angry. Why had the steward come up to him? How did he know it was Henry who was supposed to be watched?

"It was a good idea, too," the steward said. "You just needed a little more training. Still, I don't think anyone will come out in your favor here. No one wants him."

Henry shook his head. He didn't know what to say. His father had promised he would have a better life than the one he had.

"Why do you look so surprised? You and your father both wanted the Prince to be gone."

"You know," Henry answered, "you and I are just like the ones they called us."

"You may be, but I am not." The steward shrugged. "I have never known a man like him. And now he has gotten even worse."

Henry wanted to know what that meant, but he was afraid to ask. He was scared he would end up as the steward had, and the steward would know how frightened he really was.

"Why would he move here?" Henry asked. "He knows nothing about us."

"I thought that was what you were supposed to do. Be better than you are."

"I tried," Henry answered. "But every time I try, it does not work."

"It's your father you should blame," the steward told him. "I hate to say it, but he has ruined you."

"I will never be the kind of person you want me to be."

"No, of course not. You will be who you always</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:24
