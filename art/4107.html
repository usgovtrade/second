FTP—Fail to Print (as in data processing of a hard drive). In computer, the FTP function is a basic service to preserve the data that is stored in files. The user is in practice incapable of writing on a new file since it is not known if the new data has been correctly entered and/or recorded. The file has in theory the same dimension in memory. It is an archive-style function, which stores and organizes an exact copy of the data that was in the file at a previous moment in time. In the event that the user fails to write the data back to the file, the original data is preserved as a “backup” file. File FTP is an example of a service that has been generally implemented for several decades in a large number of computer applications. File FTP is the oldest of the FTP services. It is known for its speed and its great simplicity. A FTP server is described in detail in the Internet document entitled, “File Transfer Protocol (FTP)”, at www.cs.princeton.edu/˜chua/courses/6886/fall98/netwk/ftptxt.html (© 1998, Chiu, et al.).
Fail to Print (as in data processing of a hard drive). The fail to print process refers to a data processing mechanism, which is used in the data processing industry and for backup functions, wherein, on the one hand, data on a first data carrier is transmitted via a computer network to a second data carrier which, on the other hand, is for example a hard disk of a computer. An error check is performed as to whether there are differences between the data sets. If there is an error between the data sets, the FTP service is used to back up the data from the first data carrier to the second data carrier.
Fail to Service (as in service). Service refers to the service rendered by the maintenance of a system. For example, as to telecommunication networks, service in this respect relates to the transmission of information between telecommunication network subscribers. An example of such a service could be the transmission of subscriber identification information via an internal interface of the telecommunication network between the telecommunication network subscribers.
Fail to Transfer (as in traffic). The FTP service is also used for the transport of data. The FTP service, for example, is used to transfer a file between computer systems.
IDS—Intrusion Detection System. An IDS is a system that is located in the networked environment and is used, for example, to detect network attacks. A so-called sensor can, for example, be mounted at a network interface card or with a network card as a card. Such IDS sensors monitor the communication protocol packets and in turn identify attacks using packet pattern recognition and packet profile storage. An example of an IDS sensor is the IPS sensor (Intrusion Prevention System) of the Cisco Firewall Service Switch product. Such IPS sensors are described in a technical article entitled, “The Cisco IPS Network Security Monitor,” by Scott Wright (Wright, et al., Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, Calif., Aug. 28, 2000).
ISA—ISA is a technical standard with regard to the technical specifications for the transmission of data between computers. It is used, for example, for the transmission of data between a file server and a workstation. A data transfer protocol is thereby defined, wherein a directory structure and file structures can be defined.
SCF—SCF is a telecommunication network component. For example, SCF is used in connection with a network management platform. A management platform is, for example, a server that administers and manages communication networks and their components. An example of such a management platform is the Cisco CallManager management platform, which monitors the network traffic of a telecommunication network. Such management platforms are described in a technical article entitled, “The Cisco CallManager: Network and Endpoint Management System,” by M. Williams (Williams, IEEE Communications Magazine, February 2000).
Storage Server. The SCF storage server can be used, for example, for the storage of file data. The storage can occur, for example, via an SCF interface.
SM—SM is a proprietary data network that is associated with a telecommunications network and which includes private computers and a proprietary data network.
SMS—SMS is a telecommunication service.
SM/TP—The telecommunication service SMS is provided for business customers. In order to receive the SMS service, a customer must buy, for example, from an operator or other authorized seller a personal identification module (SIM card). In addition, the service is dependent on service agreements between the operators. The SMS service permits the transmission of messages between mobile communication devices, which permits an effective communication between mobile communication devices in a telecommunication system that is dependent on a telecommunication network. In addition, the use of an SMS is free of charge for the operators of the telecommunication networks, so that no additional costs are incurred by the operators when using the service.
SMX—SMX is a computer that permits the processing and storage of data in packets. The packetized data is, for example, transmitted on a proprietary data network. A SMX is, for example, a component of an SCF. An SCF is a communication network component, which may include a SMX.
SMW—SMW is a commercial data carrier, which, for example, can be an SD memory card, an USB memory stick, a CF card or other similar card, for example in a PCMCIA card format. The data carrier is connected to the telecommunication system via a cable or via radio. The data carrier can be inserted, for example, into a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and is for this reason also referred to as a PDA card.
T—T is a telecommunication network.
TCPS—TCP is the transfer control protocol, which makes it possible to establish a telecommunication connection. A telecommunication network component associated with the network transmission protocols, TCP and IP, forms the basis of telecommunication networks.
TDM—Time division multiplex. For example, in a telecommunication network, the use of TDM is a method by which telecommunication connections are conducted using digital channels, wherein the channels are time-multiplexed on a physical path in order to permit the transmission of different types of signals in the respective digital channels, such as speech and data.
TDMA—Time Division Multiple Access. In a telecommunication network, TDMA is a method, by which telecommunication channels that are respectively time-multiplexed are available for the transmission of different types of signals. A telecommunication channel may, for example, be the analog or digital channel of a telecommunication network. In addition to TDM and TDMA, a telecommunication network also includes frame protocols, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).
TFTP—TFTP is a telecommunication service. For example, TFTP is a method by which files can be transferred on the basis of a file transfer protocol from a data carrier to a computer, for example a SCF, via a telecommunication network.
Time division multiplex. For example, in a telecommunication network, the use of TDM is a method by which telecommunication connections are conducted using digital channels, wherein the channels are time-multiplexed on a physical path in order to permit the transmission of different types of signals in the respective digital channels, such as speech and data.

In addition to TDM and TDMA, a telecommunication network also includes frame protocols, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).
Unistr—Unistr is an example of a data network protocol, which, for example, can be used in a telecommunication network. A unistr is a data network protocol with a header, for example in the form of the so-called PPP header of Point-to-Point Protocol.
VPN—VPN is a telecommunication network service. VPN provides the information for creating a data packet and transmits this data packet. A special network interface is normally necessary, which forwards the packets.
WLAN—Wireless Local Area Network.
Workstation—The data processing units that are used for data processing are also referred to as workstations.
