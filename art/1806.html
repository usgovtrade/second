"'Ladies' man Luke Shawcross was out to catch us all!" "But is he gonna make it?" "'The other riders were having their usual trouble with the mud!" "'" "This was the final sector, 'the legendary 'Mud Mile'... only 12 horses remain, the rider's faces hidden behind mud masks." "This was the key to the finish, 'the first rider over the line won." "And who's going to be last over the line?" "With only a couple of minutes left to go, it looked like Luke Shawcross had the lead..." "'And now it's Luke Shawcross at the front, with Gareth McCreadie close behind." "'Last man off the mark, here comes Danny Crouch." "Crouch's still coming." "A big push here from Danny Crouch!" "No!" "'McCreedy and Crouch..." "'..McCr-acky and Crou-ch!" "No!" "'" "Crouch!" "That was Crouch, Danny Crouch has pulled it out!" "'Now it's Benj Allcroft." "He's just gotta make it." "'And here he is." "It's Allcroft across the line." "'Benj Allcroft is our winner...'" "'You can imagine the relief, Danny." "At last, your chance to win in the mud!" "'" "Ben, your dad'd be so proud of you!" "What?" "!" "I mean, he was proud of you as a little boy, wasn't he?" "But what did your dad think of you...as a grown-up?" "What?" "Your dad." "What did he think of you as a grown-up?" "Just...don't go there." "He said he hoped I was a bloody good vet!" "What else was he gonna say?" "!" "That was all!" "He wasn't a big one for words, was he?" "Your dad was a great man." "He knew more about you than you did." "You needed him and he never let you down." "He was my hero." "He was my hero." "I can remember my first day." "He was the only one there, just me, him, and Rosie, in the kennels, 'and there was so much to do." "'There were rabbits and pigs and sick dogs to stitch up, 'chase up, feed up...'" "'There he is, our favourite vet." "Can't you just see it?" "'" "Hello, Ben!" "I'm here!" "Hello!" "My name's Rosie." "This is my puppy Sammy." "Are you our new boy, Ben?" "You're Ben." "I am?" "Who's this?" "Is this you?" "We're twins." "We've got a secret, haven't we, Ben?" "You're very special to us." "Am I?" "We're all very special to Rosie, Ben." "How's your new room, Ben?" "I've got a really cosy bed, and there's lots of animals for me to look after." "I've got all sorts of new friends." "Well, you'll have to visit me again sometime." "OK?" "That's when I went and got him out of bed." "He was just staring out of the window at me!" "I don't think he liked his new room." "I don't think he liked the animals." "So I came back the next day and..." "..he was dead!" "Come on!" "You're up, Ben!" "Do I look all right?" "Better be going." "What's wrong with him?" "Well, he looks knackered!" "He's knackered, all right." "And you've seen the rest of the day!" "He's knackered." "Right, come on." "You're OK." "Come on." "Up you go." "Up you get." "OK, here we go." "What's wrong with him?" "He can't tell his own time, can he?" "That's why they've sent him to the home, it's obvious." "I think it's a matter of, um..." "What do you call them?" "Hospital, in a different way?" "I think he's sick." "But if it was that, he'd have told me." "I think he wants to go home." "Oh, God." "He was looking for his owner when he found you, Ben." "That's when he was most...um, angry." "We didn't find you till later, did we?" "When he was back with the other dogs." "That's why you took him." "Ben, you saw what you wanted to see, didn't you?" "He's got no owners now." "But we don't know what he's been through." "And the other dogs, maybe you didn't mean it." "I don't know if we should've left him." "Of course you should have left him!" "But how can we leave him with all those other dogs?" "We shouldn't have done that, not you and me." "I've been thinking a lot about the man who put us in that van." "He was..." "I suppose I must be a bit of a hero, in a way." "I should've told him, but I just didn't know how to." "Well, Ben, you're going to learn that one day, and then the world won't have a clue what's going on in it!" "You'll make me proud!" "But, um..." "I'm gonna need you." "How much am I gonna need me?" "I don't know." "Probably the rest of my life." "I love you, Ben." "Are you OK?" "Do you want a cup of tea?" "We can have it together, in the kitchen." "Come on." "Good luck." "You know, most people would just think, "I wonder what happened to that poor dog."" "But you know all about it." "I just want the animal to come home to its owner." "That's all." "The problem is we don't know who that might be!" "But if we check all the dogs' tags and run through them, who are the unlucky ones?" "That's what we do, then!" "Get some kennels to clear out." "See if there's anything they could have picked up!" "You're getting warm!" "You're gonna go back there." "It's just the two of us." "Who's the best lead-out man you've got?" "We just need to ask those, um..." "Vets, yeah." "Let's go and talk to them." "A lot of vets work together in teams now, a specialist bit and a bit of a back-up." "There's one that's just the opposite." "Just a bloke called Phil Taylor." "He worked in a veterinary hospital." "He would pick up strays... ..and bring them to his own kennels, a bit like you, Ben." "But then, that was a long time ago." "If you've got his number, I'd just like to have a word with him." "There's no point, Ben." "I spoke to him yesterday." "The dog has no tag, it won't be picked up." "He was just putting his best head on and offering his services." "Well, I know a bloke on his team, he'll know him." "So, what do you think?" "Well, he does sound..." "Doubtful, but keep talking to him." "Tell him you've got a team of people to follow up if you get anything." "If you're lucky, it might be him." "OK, Ben, if you do manage to get anything from that list, what are you going to do?" "I'll get in touch with you, of course." "Come on." "OK, I've got one more thing to do before I leave you." "Do you think your dad would be proud of you?" "I bet you thought I wouldn't find you again." "Now, was that a trick?" "A trick?" "OK." "Where are you going, then?" "Well, I think it's time we went home." "If I tell the truth, would that make me a hero?" "Yeah, the things I'd have to tell." "I don't think I'm ready for that yet." "Did you forget about him?" "No." "I never forgot, I just didn't think of him all the time." "It's nice of you to bring him, it's just..." "It's better if you don't come again, Ben." "Why?" "Because they're just dogs, aren't they?" "You don't want them to have owners that don't love them any more." "He'd better stay home tonight." "He's your dog now, not mine." "Do you want me to come and sit with you?" "No." "Then you must have got a girlfriend." "You really think so?" "Well, when you go home, do you think they'll ask who you're going to see?" "No." "But who do you think they'll be, that's your problem?" "I'll look after him while you're gone, OK?" "We need to find this guy before it gets dark." "Will he</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:32
