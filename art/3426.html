As part of the plan, Disney has also agreed to maintain a standard "Disney Dine Around" policy for at least six years for all travelers.

"Guests want the right to choose where, when and how they dine. Disney Cruise Line has always believed in offering our guests a variety of dining options to satisfy their needs, and the enhanced plan reflects that commitment," said J. J. Rendon, Disney Cruise Line's senior vice president of marketing and guest relations. "We are proud to offer our guests the opportunity to dine in some of the most renowned restaurants throughout the world when they visit Disney Cruise Line. Our guests are not going to lose the ability to dine at Castaway Cay on Disney Dream, Disney Fantasy or Disney Magic, so we're pleased to expand our 'Dine Around' program to make it easier for guests to take advantage of these wonderful dining options."

The enhanced plan will also allow guests to participate in the Disney Dining Plan and the Disney Dining Rewards program on Disney Dream, Disney Fantasy and Disney Magic and Disney's private island Castaway Cay aboard these ships.

Guests can book a trip to the public island when it is operated by Disney, and can participate in the Disney Dining Plan or Disney Dining Rewards when they sail on a voyage operated by Disney.

Disney will continue to promote a variety of dining options across the company's cruise ships, and to keep pricing and inventory in line with marketplace trends.
