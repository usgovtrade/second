a strong belief that these same  benefits are attainable through  e-business 
transformation," said Rick Causey, chief executive officer for Enron.  "It 
wasn't that long ago that many of our energy clients were derisively called 
low-tech, pulp and paper mills running on batch systems.  Today, we are 
calling the same customers the high-tech equivalents of their former selves. 
Many former stand-alone, highly manual businesses have become highly 
automated and virtually paperless enterprises.  The drivers of this change 
are the same in our markets - a profound shift in the way that customers 
demand flexibility, choice, lower costs, and greater control, all integrated 
with the seamless quality of e-business.  This new approach creates a 
compelling model for the transformation of  high-tech and other  traditional 
industries."  
	
	
	Back to the future - the end-user experience
	
	To fully reap the benefits of e-commerce, customers must be able to send and 
receive information across internal and external networks easily and 
securely. With the growth of e-business, the Internet is becoming an 
essential system of record, storing information about every transaction in 
the supply chain.  This is why we believe that e-business holds the key to 
unlocking our corporate client's value chain. 
	
	To ensure that e-business meets these business needs, Enron has developed an 
integrated global framework, based on our e-business strategy, to enable the 
exchange of business documents -- blueprints, models, and related information 
-- regardless of format, across organizational boundaries, both inside and 
outside Enron. It is our intent to support the proliferation of e-commerce by 
providing the right tools for the job and ensure technology simplicity.
	
	Our e-business model focuses on optimizing customer interaction and 
experiences across all channels, devices, media, and applications. It is a 
customer-centric approach that helps break down internal walls, facilitates 
knowledge sharing across the enterprise, and drives the vision, strategy, 
innovation, and growth of our company. 
	
	
	The Enron Intelligent Network
	
	Enron's goal is to create a network of intelligent services.  This network 
will give our business units the ability to offer customers the latest 
technology and to go to market with e-commerce solutions.  The Enron 
Intelligent Network is based on an enterprise wide shared services center 
(ESSC) that enables us to manage many of the network aspects such as 
customer segmentation, application processing, data storage, physical 
infrastructure, network operations, delivery, and maintenance through 
contracts, dedicated professionals, and a powerful infrastructure 
infrastructure.
		

	The Impact of e-Business on EES and Enron as a whole 
	
	e-Business represents an enormous opportunity for EES as well as Enron, and 
our first quarter was a landmark event for us. We went from practically no 
trading activity to over $336 million in wholesale and retail 
commodity-related transactions. We are well on our way to another trading 
record in Q2, thanks to the enormous opportunities in our energy outsourcing 
business and the remarkable level of interest in EES. It is clear that the 
market wants to go much faster than our initial vision of enabling customers 
to make the switch to new technologies by migrating the slowest processes 
first. However, we have tremendous momentum behind us, and we are working 
extremely hard to ensure that our development cycle for Internet-enabled 
applications and infrastructure does not create a lead time bias for our 
customers. The good news is that we believe we have more than a year to the 
introduction of the Enron Intelligent Network, and we are positioning 
ourselves to move very quickly when the opportunity arises.
	
	Financial Services
	
	We've established Enron Global Finance, a dedicated finance unit to provide 
outstanding financial services to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries. 
	
	We provide financial clout, expertise, and intellectual capital to the energy 
and telecommunications industries through financial advisory services, 
product development, technical evaluation, and other services.
	
	
	To provide these services, we leverage EES' market-leading position in energy 
outsourcing and worldwide broadband trading and origination, as well as our 
broad internal financial and energy management capabilities. 
	
	
	
	Future Globalization Efforts in EES
	
	Our business model, in which we leverage off Enron's global network, 
technology, and market-making expertise to provide customers with the tools 
to manage and reduce energy usage, provides EES with tremendous 
opportunities. This market presents us with many challenges - managing price 
risk, managing multiple commodities, and ensuring the highest quality of 
customer service - but it offers the potential for profitable global 
business. We are actively working to seize these opportunities. To date, we 
have opened offices in Brazil, Canada, China, India, Mexico, and most recently 
in Japan, in addition to our presence in the U.S. and Europe. We have a 
extensive set of activities under way to build a truly global wholesale 
business for Enron.
	
	Conclusion - The Third Way
	
	We have worked for our customers for over 10 years to deliver them new 
e-business solutions and develop market-leading positions in the global 
e-commerce arena. From consulting to bundling and hosting, software to 
hardware, applications to communications, transaction processing to 
throughput, the Enron Intelligent Network, e-Commerce, and worldwide 
broadband network capability and services represent our commitment to our 
customers, our reputation for quality, and our vision for the future of the 
global economy. We believe that Enron can provide the foundation for an 
agile and dynamic e-business. This enables not just our customers but also 
the industry as a whole to rethink the fundamental way the business is 
conducted. 
	
	Congratulations on the successful completion of your first quarter. We look 
forward to your further success and the pursuit of new opportunities for 
growth and value in 2001.
