The single "This Diamond Ring" became a UK No. 3 hit in 1965, and has since sold over a million copies. He also composed "You Were on My Mind", a top-five hit for the American group the Grass Roots (also covered by Herman's Hermits, the Yardbirds and the Hollies, among others).

He also wrote the Top 20 hit "Take Out Some Insurance on Me Tonight" for Cilla Black, and "Just You 'n' Me" for Herman's Hermits (No. 5 in UK, and No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100), "I Don't Want to Hear It Anymore" for Dusty Springfield, "I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)" for Sonny James, "Don't You Love Me Anymore" for Dusty Springfield (also a Top 10 hit for Anne Murray), and "The Last Time I Felt Like This" for Rod Stewart (also a hit for Eric Clapton).

Dalby has worked with singers Cilla Black, Dusty Springfield, Anne Murray, Benny Gallagher and Lulu, as well as recording artist Bobby Rydell, composer-arranger George Martin, and the Merseybeats with Kenny Lynch.

He worked for the BBC from 1961, composing the theme music for The Beatles' "All You Need Is Love" and accompanying documentary for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth.

His son, Gary Dalby, has pursued a musical career himself.
