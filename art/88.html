Instead  
of feeling like there's a chance I might be  
meant to know, I feel a creeping paralysis.  
It's a feeling from deep inside me, like  
an ice cube being melted into a bucket.

## Sometime in the Future

The future of this part of me.  
Where we meet. It occurs to me  
that by thinking the way I do about this  
place that I know will exist for a while  
before I'm done with it, before I'm done  
with this journey, that this place  
would be nothing without me.  
And that by not wanting to exist  
anymore, I've made an awful lot of  
things more terrible for everybody else.

## Sometime in the Future

There's a place in my head that says  
people have been trying to talk to God  
all along, there is in fact such a thing  
as a God—all the rest is noise and  
noise and noise. But I think there's  
one very simple and basic rule: it's  
enough to want to be, to be  
willing to go out into the  
dark in a world of people. That  
is enough. You don't have to get  
somebody else there with you.  
If you want to be, you can be.  
That is the only real prayer.

## The Truth of You

I know the world is much too  
big for one person to understand it.  
I know there is not one person who  
understands you.  
But I love you for being you.  
I know I am you.

# PART II

## The Truth of You

You say to me, you say: I exist.  
And in the moment of your  
speaking, I can know it is true.

## Who Is Your Father?

_"Who is your father, Mother?"_

For I have known the love  
you would teach me and will.  
You, the real one, the one  
that I knew when I met you  
and still know when you are  
gone. The one that will bring  
me the day after, the one  
that is your only father, my  
father, the one that I love.

## The Truth of You

The day I met you for the first time,  
I had seen you before.  
You were a mirror, I a reflection  
in a reflection of something  
else I couldn't find. I don't  
know whether you knew  
what was happening or not.  
All I know is that you spoke to me  
in a voice I felt I knew better  
than my own, and suddenly  
I knew you for who you  
were, and I knew the  
breath I drew, I drew in  
with you. I wasn't born  
by a baby as many think,  
I was breathed in with you.

I know that to love you, it  
is enough for me to be you.  
And for me to know that in  
every world there is one  
place where I could be  
you—that one place, that  
place where all the  
worlds are, is enough  
to love you.

## In the Place of You

Where I am, where I feel  
the air I can't name.

It is not that place I am or  
will always be. It is the  
place that has never been  
and will never be.

For all the places of you  
are everywhere, where  
I am. And I am where  
you are.

When you are no longer there,  
my place will change.  
It will be still in you,  
but something will have  
changed.

## In the Place of You

When I came to know you, I  
became what I love.  
I understood in every way,  
and in the places of you,  
wherever they are.

I came to know them because  
they were what they were and  
who they were, and because  
they were what they were and  
who they were, I loved them.

## In the Place of You

In your world, and in my  
world, there are no words  
to describe what it is we  
feel for each other.  
Words exist to describe what  
we understand.

To describe what you know and  
what I do not.

# THE LADY OF THE  
STARS

## To My Friend Who Told  
Me I was a Dreamer

To the world that will not  
believe you,

To all of you who will  
never believe,

To the part of you who  
wishes you would never  
believe—

## The Lady of the  
Stars

I come to you in this hour  
of your death  
because I love you,

And in your death, I  
know you in a new way.

## The Lady of the  
Stars

You may not believe I am  
here, but I tell you,  
this is true.

This is the truth  
that rises up  
as you die.

## To My Friend Who Told  
Me I was a Dreamer

You were always telling me  
that life was a dream.  
I knew you didn't believe  
you were wrong,

But I knew you  
always believed you  
were wrong.

I will be what I have  
always known I am  
and what I am now  
is not what I thought I was,  
and it is you who are my  
life and you are my death.

I have seen you die, and it  
has become my  
life.

## The Lady of the  
Stars

I am you now, more than I  
have ever been.

You do not live within me  
and I do not live within you  
but we speak and  
we understand each other  
at the places where our  
souls are joined.

When you walk through the  
world, the world is filled  
with your steps.

Wherever you go, you  
are walking on the  
world's back.

## To My Friend Who Told  
Me I was a Dreamer

I have known you for a long  
time, I think.

There are nights when  
you feel a darkness  
beyond the darkness of the  
moment.  
There are nights when  
the world you live in is  
changing and you don't know  
if you are awake or dreaming,  
and you don't know which way to  
turn.

You are waking up and  
not dreaming.  
You are a place I remember  
only by its light.

I bring you back to this  
light because  
it is the only  
way in.

## To My Friend Who Told  
Me I was a Dreamer

You taught me what I knew  
by telling me it was  
not true.

My dream was that you  
believed in the world  
I live in and that we are  
alive, and all of us have  
a story we have to tell, and  
it is to each other that we  
have to tell it.

And when we don't, we know  
how the world sees us.

I have been afraid,  
my friend.

But now I know you, and  
I believe that  
there are things of me that  
will never die.

## To My Friend Who Told  
Me I was a Dreamer

You made me afraid  
that I wouldn't know  
what I would never know.

I am sure of what I know  
now.

I have been to the dark.  
I have been to the dark  
to know where you have  
come from.  
It is the world of light  
that you bring me to, and </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:06
