dynamically create and destroy content. We're currently using this technique to 
provide a custom version of a JRE to a web site. There's an obvious similarity 
to Sun's techniques used in their Java Applet API, but ours do not meet any 
standards at this time, so Java Applets will NOT work with our products. Also, 
our content is not compiled but rather dynamically created, and our methods are 
not called with a URL parameter. This is going to make life more challenging for 
those who have tried to reverse engineer our engine, but is also an important 
security measure to ensure that a customer cannot give a copy of our product to 
someone else, either through distribution of a standalone executable or through 
a browser enabled, Java enabled web site. 
I think that the security features are a far more exciting point for those of 
us who are security minded, as the technique will hopefully help to ensure that 
our products are usable even in an executable form.

You don't want these to work in a standalone executable. 
You don't want them to run in a browser enabled Java enabled web site. 
Why ? 

Because our content is dynamically created, our methods are not called with a 
URL parameter.

Hello Eric, 
To work around the security-related issues, you may create a new URL format by 
prefixing the string 'http://www.yahoole.com/java' to a method call and 
redirecting it with JavaScript. 
Eg. 
1. Go to http://www.yourexecutable.com/javacustom.html 
2. A prompt will be displayed asking for a name to use for the new method call. 
3. Give your method a name and select the name from the select field and click 
'Add'. 
4. A URL will be displayed. 
5. For testing purposes, 'http://www.yahoole.com/java' can be appended to the 
URL, like this: http://www.yahoole.com/java?this=is+the+new+custom+url. 
If you plan to sell your product, you may not want to do this. 
The 'this' word will be used by our product to call your custom method. It is 
safe to append it to your URL as we don't use it internally, but any 
customers that receive your product should remove it before distribution. 
_________________________________________________________________________

We don't want to use it internally either. We're not making a standalone 
product here. We're selling one package that will be deployed in the field. 
That's why it's a "you may not want to do this". Please do not call your 
method like this. It could be bad. 
If you want to pass something from JavaScript to your methods, use a 
post request. That's it. That's the way it's done. 
-Eric

You do know about JavaScript (don't you ?) 
You can pass whatever you want with a post request.
I have some sample code that is part of the SDK which demonstrates how to use 
this technique. Look at how the 'create' methods are being used. 
Look at the comments in the files. Look at the examples. If you still think 
this is bad, please ignore this email and we will work something else out. 
I have wasted enough of your time with this.

We do care about the ability to add or remove content. 
If you create a new product, you can simply add a new method call by adding a 
new name/value pair to the URL. The current methods could then be renamed, 
leaving the existing methods intact. Alternatively, you could change your 
methods to a POST protocol or pass more parameters. What you can't do is simply 
add a URL parameter and have it work without changing the code. 
If you are going to make a product, it will be released publicly and you will 
be expected to respond to inquiries. You cannot expect us to make 
changes to a product, ship it and then have another version of the product 
released the next day. If you're going to make a public product, don't do it.

A product that is released publicly should not be limited to what a previous 
version contained. 
I can see how the current method calls would allow a product that is designed 
for a specific set of content, but no new content can be added without 
modifying the code. If there is no access, how are users supposed to keep 
adding content? 
The methods have been designed so that our code does not have to 
change to allow for new content to be added or to allow old content to be 
removed. Customers could add their own methods for updating their content. 
If we need to make a change to the product's functionality, it will involve 
modifying the API for adding new content, which can be done for the method 
calls. 

If I'm going to make a product that will be released publicly and we have to 
change something about it, how am I supposed to react? This is exactly the 
kind of thing you should discuss with us BEFORE you do it. It's not really 
very productive to do this after the fact. You can see this in the example 
code for the SDK. We specifically try to keep the API flexible so that we can 
easily change it without affecting customers.

A lot of customers use our product to develop web sites that contain 
scripted, interactive content. There are many, many websites that are using 
our products in this way and cannot be changed to a different method call. 
It is difficult and expensive to change the structure of a site after the 
fact. Customers do not want to do this, and they should not have to. 
As stated earlier, any customers that receive the product should remove 
the 'this' string to allow the product to work without modification. 
Since there is a limited number of names, it's okay to use them all. If it 
turns out there are names that are not being used, they will be removed. 
The only thing we can't do is to create a separate list of names. All of 
the numbers can simply be bumped up by a few numbers. Some people believe this 
is a bad idea, which is what made me write this email to you.

Why did you even send this email ? 
This is obviously a very big misunderstanding.

Please accept my apologies. 
One of our clients has asked us to implement a Java-based product that 
creates content dynamically through a Java control hosted in their web site. 
In some cases, they want to remove some content as well. 
They have asked us to create a new version of our product in this way, 
which is why we decided to use the 'this' string to dynamically create the 
required Java methods to create content.
