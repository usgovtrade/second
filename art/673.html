Instead 
of a few days she spent 6 weeks in the ICU and her recovery is still 
extremely uncertain. She is home now and we pray every night that she 
gets better. As I told her yesterday we are so thankful that she 
survived but it will be a long road to full recovery and all of the 
damage done to her heart, lungs, kidneys and blood by the toxins is 
going to take time to heal. In the meantime I am trying to protect 
her from all the germs and viruses that she has never seen before. The 
good news is that he was not affected by the chemicals. That is the 
reason for the good news. We are keeping her here until her doctors 
release her back to us in 4 weeks. Then she will be on strict meds and 
is going to have to follow all of their orders. The doctors said that 
after 6 weeks she will still have damage but he will be fine. The 
doctors are not saying that she would have been ok if she was here 
10-15 years ago but we will never know. 
I am working frantically to keep my home and finances afloat as 
she will not return to work for at least a year, if ever. We have been 
living on her disability checks and I will lose that income. We have 
$15,000 in medical bills. She will need a new place to live when she 
is able to return home. It will have to be a single wide mobile home 
and there is no way I can afford it. The bank took our land as they 
were calling it in as a loss. Our new building will be in foreclosure 
at the end of November if the bank does not come through. They did 
send me a small check today, so maybe things will get better and I 
can start saving up. I have lost my confidence as I just cannot do 
anything and there are bills to pay. 
That about sums up our situation. We will see how things turn out as 
I have to take life one day at a time. I think I am more depressed 
and confused than she is. It has been 3 weeks since this all 
happened, and I feel so much better that she survived, but like she 
said, it is going to be a long, long time before she will be back to 
her old self. I pray that she gets well and soon so I can enjoy my 
new granddaughter and so she can go on with her life. 
Oh and yes we are now down to two dogs and 6 cats.
