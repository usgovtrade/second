Because of this economic crisis, the national currency has experienced a drop of 50%. It has worsened the current circumstances.

What are your expectations regarding 2016?

The world situation is difficult. We have a serious economic crisis. We need new solutions. We need a solid financial system, not one based on bank loans. The development of agriculture should be accelerated, and should have a positive impact on farmers’ income. I hope the financial community takes into account these challenges and implements the solutions proposed in last year’s National Assembly Address (2015). I believe the authorities will be able to find and adopt solutions in time. I want Ukraine to become a developed, more prosperous, democratic, socially just, wealthy, secure and united country, in other words, an open economy.

You are the first President who graduated from an Ukrainian-American university – The City University of New York (CUNY) with two different degrees in Economics and Law. Did you participate in any educational programmes during your stay in the USA? What were they about?

I came to the United States in 1976. In that time, in order to get the education, I was studying twice as much as a regular student – I had to attend university classes and also participate in a three-hour a week night class for immigrants that was conducted in our neighbourhood in Queens. As far as I can remember, this course was aimed at helping us learn how to speak, read and write English, in order to be able to get a job. I did not enjoy this education program and I don’t recommend anyone else to do so.

In 1977 I started my formal education by participating in two student exchange programmes. I was a member of the International Student Exchange Program in Ukraine. Then I went to CUNY and was the first person in my family to graduate from a university.

During my stay in the US, I participated in several programmes. For example, the USAID (United States Agency for International Development) programme. This programme helps Ukrainians to get scholarships and provides training programmes for our public servants.

I participated in a programme called “Trends of Change in Global Legal Environment” that was held at the University of Maryland. It lasted eight months. The topic was comparative law and how the different legal systems in various countries affect the foreign business activity.

Another programme that I participated in was aimed at introducing the basic principles of good governance to Ukraine.

I was also a foreign expert at the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I worked there for five years. I am very familiar with the international financial institutions and, in my opinion, they play an extremely important role in developing any country.

Our Government took action on the basis of the recommendations that came from the UN International Investment and Services Centre and the World Bank that were held in 2015. The centre recommended three priority areas:

The centre recommended changing the legislation,

The centre recommended changing the taxation system, and

The centre recommended the development of the investment climate.

They all received my support. It is also worth mentioning that I supported and took the decision to cancel the Law “On Measures for the Development of Free Economic Zones of Ukraine” in 2014. This law infringes the rights of investors and reduces the investors’ level of confidence in Ukraine. Therefore, we need to change this legislation.

Have you ever been a member of any other organisations? Did you have any positions during your career? How has your position changed throughout the years?

Yes, I have been a member of an organisation. For several years I was also the legal representative of my university, the City University of New York. My work with the university allowed me to have more opportunities for academic discussions, which contributed to the development of my career. For example, I worked as a lecturer at the US State Department in 2005 and 2006. I was also a director of the World Bank Institute.

Do you think that your past experience in the United States can help you to achieve better results in Ukraine?

The lessons learned in the US, of course, helped me significantly to understand what Ukrainian students should focus on if they are interested in studying in the US, and I did not make many mistakes while working with other university programmes. What’s more, the US is one of the most developed countries in the world. Therefore, any advice and guidance is worth looking into.

What are your plans for after your tenure as the President of Ukraine? Are you planning to take any position in the Government after your term ends?

At this point, I am not planning to take any position in the Government. For now I don’t want to consider this option, considering that the Constitution of Ukraine allows the President to be re-elected only twice. My term will end on May 31, 2016. When the time comes, I will take into consideration the offer of leading a foreign state agency, for example, but at this time this option is not a priority for me.

Since you were already a teacher, what can you advise Ukraine’s future President to study?

I think that all of our teachers should be our future presidents. As I already mentioned, I studied in the City University of New York. The curriculum at this university is based on the “four-year rule”. First, in the first year, the student must get acquainted with the American life, then in the second year he needs to study economics and in the fourth year, he should prepare for his high school leaving exam. This is how the programme is organised at the American universities.

I would recommend the Ukrainian government adopt this programme, and all future heads of state should follow this programme.

I also recommend studying foreign languages. I personally believe it is vital for a successful politician to have sufficient knowledge of at least two foreign languages. For example, if he/she wants to pursue a diplomatic career, he or she needs to speak at least three languages. To me this was a huge advantage.

According to your experience in the United States, which would you consider as the greatest threat to Ukraine’s success in modernising the economy?

I think the biggest threat to Ukraine is to think it is just another country. This is the main reason behind its downfall, which is very sad. Just think about where Russia is located and Ukraine is located. If Ukraine was like Russia, our country would have never become an independent state.

Now we live in the 21st century, and the world is being connected at a rapid pace. Unfortunately, some Ukrainians still act as if we were in the middle of the 19th century.

At the same time, the United States, that played such a significant role in Ukraine’s independence, seems to understand that there is a lot to be done in Ukraine. Many of its officials and private citizens have expressed their interest in seeing the most beneficial results from their joint efforts with us. We should make our relations with the United States a priority.

On the international level, do you think that Ukraine will find a role that suits its capabilities? What makes you consider Ukraine to be a good partner for the United States?

It is very difficult for me to give a conclusive answer. To tell you the truth, at this moment I have my doubts. But, I still believe that Ukraine has much to offer. Yes, there are some Ukrainian politicians who are not able to find their place in the international society.

However, I am sure that President Poroshenko will find a constructive and correct direction of Ukraine’s development. If we have a stable and good partnership with the United States, we will be able to improve Ukraine’s economy.

Do you think that you have been a positive influence on Ukraine?

I am still one of the most active and most important political figures in Ukraine, because I have had many opportunities to meet with the President. He often asked me for advice on how to implement certain policies. We also discussed issues concerning the public’s interests. I can honestly say that my active support to the President will continue.

In your opinion, what are the main factors that determine the level of Ukraine’s development?

The most important factor for the development of any country is stability and sound finances. I am extremely sorry that this political crisis has disturbed the world’s financial market. In this regard, we need to discuss a lot of important issues. I sincerely believe that our Finance Minister Yatsenyuk can help restore Ukraine’s financial sector. He has my full support and I am sure that he can restore the financial sector and stabilise the national currency.
