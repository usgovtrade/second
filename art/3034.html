But seriously, I don’t think I could resist a piece of vintage furniture. Especially when it’s so pretty. I think that’s what attracts me to vintage things most of all.

It’s a beautiful, yet simple, chair. I think one of the things I love about it is the simplicity of the design, compared to what a lot of upholstered chairs in my price range have. It’s also a good example of what I feel like vintage should be.

Because I’ve only had the chair for a day now, I can’t give you all the details, but I can tell you it’s quite comfy and the colour is lovely. It’s more of a mustard yellow colour than it is mustardy, which for me is quite appealing. I definitely want to put a cushion on it to make it more soft and comfortable, so even though it’s a more modern chair, it will soon be looking pretty vintage.

The chair measures up at just under 90cm wide, by around 110cm high (and by a friend to help me out here) and the frame is an interesting shape – it has a rounded back and sides, but the front is flat. It has a slatted back, as you can see in this picture. The back is lovely.

Vintage Chair Buying Guide

While you’re out on a vintage hunting trip, there are a few things you should keep in mind. Some vintage pieces are easy to find, but others are a bit more rare or more difficult to find. And it’s best to understand what’s going on before you buy anything.

The first thing to remember is that you may have some luck in shopping at auctions, but even so, you should have your heart set on something that is fairly attainable.

The second thing you need to keep in mind is that old furniture is just that – old. It will need some TLC, and it’s not always going to be in the best condition.

The third thing to keep in mind is that you should always ask questions. The last thing you want is to end up with a piece of furniture you can’t use, because you didn’t ask the right questions.

And finally, be sure to have the patience to search for the right item. Take your time and shop carefully. You will save so much time in the long run if you take your time. Don’t just buy something because it’s cheap.

Do you have any old vintage items in your home? Do you think it’s important to update vintage pieces with vintage touches?
