So a couple of months ago, I started on a massive undertaking. My dad has always told me to stop looking at the news and all the crap and to get out and see more. A lot more.

So the plan was to travel and then share what I saw with the world. Then maybe my dad would read it and say, "hey, nice job" and I wouldn't get beat up again.

And I'd say "Dad, it's not me, it's that I have been beaten up by the weather".

So that is how it all started. I have learned about the universe and the universe about me. And I am glad I did. Because that is what this is all about.

What will be done will be done and what will not be done will not be done. So no matter where you are, wherever you are, know that all things have been done before and they will be done again. And again and again.

And so what, you say? This is me in the city of London during a blizzard.

This is me in the city of London during a blizzard with the Christmas market on.

This is me in the city of London during a blizzard with the Thames at Westminster Bridge.

This is me in the city of London during a blizzard with the Thames at Westminster Bridge and Big Ben.

This is me in the city of London during a blizzard with the Thames at Westminster Bridge and Big Ben.

This is me in the city of London during a blizzard with the Thames at Westminster Bridge and Big Ben.

This is me in the city of London during a blizzard with the Thames at Westminster Bridge and Big Ben.

This is me in the city of London during a blizzard with the Thames at Westminster Bridge and Big Ben.

And so we come to the end of this blog. But there is so much more. I have only covered the basics here, such as the weather, but there is so much more. There are thousands of years of history to be explored and stories to be heard. So many places to go. But not today. Not today. Today we have a celebration to make. And it starts now, with me and my dad here in London.

I'd like to think we shall do this again and again and again.

Thanks for listening.

Here is a picture of London during a blizzard. I think it is because we can see that from high up and our faces are covered in a thick layer of fog so it looks like the weather is covering us up. Enjoy.

About Me

We all have the same questions. Who are we? Where do we come from? Is there a god? What is the meaning of life?
I'm afraid that no one has the answers. It's time for you to use your critical thinking skills. Use your common sense. Put up your feet and walk a mile.
Just take a look around and realize we are all the same. We just want to be heard. That's it. We just want someone to listen.

Quotes

You will always be the most beautiful person in the world. We all have a beauty and it is our responsibility to present it.

Michaelangelo

I know God will not give me anything I can't handle. I just wish that He didn't trust me so much.

C.S. Lewis

If you want to wake up at dawn, don't go to bed. Wake up at dawn, don't go to bed. Wake up at dawn, don't go to bed. Wake up at dawn, don't go to bed.

Rumi

The way to gain control over the chaos in your life is to stop trying to control it.

Michael Pritchard

Our life is what our thoughts make it. Everything you have become and everything you will become has come from your thoughts.

Marcus Aurelius

You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.

Ian McKenzie

Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace & gratitude.

Denis Waitley

If I can stop one Heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one Life the Aching;
Or cool one Pain;
Or help one fainting Robin
Unto his Nest again,
I shall not live in vain.

In the end, the only thing that matters is love. You want to be full of love for yourself, your lover, and for the world. A life that fills you with love will make you the happiest person in the world. A life that doesn't, will make you the saddest.

Bhagavan Das

Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.

Mother Teresa

Do not wait for leaders; lead yourself.

Stephen Covey

Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.

Unknown

We can't solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.

Thomas Sowell

Love and respect go hand in hand.
Respect grows with love.
Love grows with respect.

Ancient Chinese Proverb

If you look deeply into the palm of your hand, you will see your parents and all generations of humans.

If you look at the features of your face, you can see the changes of your ancestors in your face.

If you go back far enough in time, you can see paradise.

Never be afraid to stand up for what you believe in, especially if they are your beliefs.

A man should learn to take care of his thoughts before they take care of him.

There is a thin line between 'loud' and 'thoughtful'.

Don't try to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

It's never too late to become who you might have been.

You don't need anyone's permission to be beautiful.

The first beauty in a man's life is to be understood by his mother.

Only half of those who want to rule give themselves to their work.

When you can measure something, and express it in numbers, it becomes science.

The best way to predict your future is to create it.

Every man is what he thinks about all day long.

People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.
