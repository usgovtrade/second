It aired on April 12, 2014. The new season featured only Cary Deuber, Cary Deuber-Pittman, LeeAnne Locken, and Brandi Redmond.

The Real Housewives of Dallas focuses on the lives of Cary Deuber, Cary Deuber-Pittman, LeeAnne Locken, and Brandi Redmond. While the show's previous season ended with a two-part reunion special, the reunion show will not take place. However, the cast will return to film its season four premiere in a special.

Production and crew
On April 13, 2013, The Dallas Morning News reported that original cast member LeeAnne Locken would not be returning for the fourth season. The New York Daily News had also reported in November 2013 that original cast member Locken had asked to be let out of her contract so that she could begin filming her new Bravo reality series, I Am LeeAnne.

Despite reports stating that all the previous season's cast members would be returning, Brandi Redmond did not return for the fourth season. Instead, newcomer Brandi Redmond was brought onto the show to replace her. On May 22, 2013, RadarOnline announced that Deuber-Pittman had chosen to leave the show. The season four premiere was filmed over the summer.

Teresa was announced as the sole returning cast member on the third episode of the fourth season. During season four, Deuber became pregnant and took maternity leave. As a result, she was replaced by Kim Zolciak as the fifth housewife.

Teresa returned for the season four reunion special. The fourth-season reunion special premiered on May 16, 2014. In an interview with The Dallas Morning News during the fourth-season reunion special, Teresa revealed that she is now a bridesmaid in Deuber's upcoming wedding to fianc√©, Dimitri Pittman, Jr.

Cast and synopsis
Shortly after being ousted from the show, Deuber-Pittman revealed that she will return to the show. Deuber-Pittman revealed that her second husband, Dimitri Pittman, Jr., filed for divorce the day before the reunion taping. The divorce is the reason why Deuber-Pittman did not return for the third season of the show. According to Deuber-Pittman, Pittman "wanted to move on from her", and that Deuber-Pittman "just wanted him to be happy, that's all." Deuber was then told by Bravo that if she were to return, her storyline would have to be in conflict with that of another cast member's storyline; if not, she would have to leave the show. After the divorce became finalized, Deuber-Pittman decided not to return. Deuber was replaced by Kim Zolciak, who Deuber-Pittman had originally been set to replace when Deuber's contract was terminated.
