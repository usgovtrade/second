As reported by Collider, a recent tweet from one of the film’s actors hinted that “all” sorts of places in the galaxy might show up in the upcoming ninth installment of the series:

A fun fact about the next film...? We shot in the desert & the rainforest (as well as a little London). — John Boyega (@JohnBoyega) October 21, 2017

Of course, we don’t have any specifics here. Still, Boyega’s comment could suggest that we’re going to get a much broader look at the Star Wars galaxy than what we got in the last two prequels — in particular, 2014’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which placed so much emphasis on planets like Jakku, while also revealing that the original trilogy took place on various cities and planets in Earth’s galaxy. As for what Boyega could be getting at, a desert setting would make some sense for the next film. As we learned from last week’s official Star Wars Instagram account, Boyega and another actor, Oscar Isaac, were spotted on an “ancient desert planet.”

While we have no idea how seriously to take Boyega’s statement, at least we can take comfort in knowing that the next Star Wars movie will at least have some pretty awesome special effects and lots of exotic locales to enjoy. Considering how amazing Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ lightsaber battle in the rainforest was, though, maybe the desert-set Rogue One might be just as fun. After all, it seems like a natural fit for the movie’s name.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi hits theaters December 15, 2017, with Star Wars: Episode IX due out sometime in 2019.
