The control of fluid dynamics generally focuses on one of two aspects, active noise control or passive noise control. Active noise control systems are often costly and complex. In one example, noise is generated by an “exciting source” and a secondary sound source is used to interfere destructively with the original source. The secondary sound source is designed such that its signal cancels out the original sound at a particular listening location. The secondary signal is generated by, for example, a transducer or loudspeaker. These noise control systems are often costly and complex. It would be beneficial to have a simple and cost-effective passive noise control system.
The development of active control systems led to passive systems and as technology matured, the passive systems were implemented in a variety of ways, including using acoustic horns, acoustic baffles, Helmholtz resonators and fluidics. One of the most common systems uses acoustic horns. The horns used are often large and costly and can result in substantial noise being generated by the horn. It would be beneficial to have a passive control system for which the acoustic horns are not required and which does not produce substantial noise.
It is also important to understand how fluidics are used as they have developed and become prevalent in many areas of technology. In fluidics, a fluid, such as air, is caused to oscillate through the motion of a diaphragm. The movement of the diaphragm creates a pressure differential between the two sides of the diaphragm which can induce acoustic or sonic waves in the fluid and air. Acoustic waves can also be caused by the introduction of particles into a fluid or air. The acoustic waves result in noise. It would be beneficial to use fluidics, without the presence of acoustic horns, to control noise.
While there have been some implementations of fluidics in noise control, the fluidics systems used have exhibited some drawbacks. As noted above, one drawback of prior art systems has been the implementation of acoustic horns to produce fluidic oscillations. In many systems, it has been difficult to control the flow of air through the horns which may result in low system efficiency. One example is an oscillating air supply system used to control vibration. The oscillating air supply is in direct communication with an acoustic horn to provide pressure oscillations to the horn for the control of vibration. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the oscillating air supply is in direct communication with the acoustic horn by using a ducting system. In this configuration, a high pressure side of a piston of the oscillating air supply system and a low pressure side of the piston are in communication with the acoustic horn. The air from the high pressure side passes through the acoustic horn to the acoustic horn throat at a substantially constant velocity, which can be estimated by the distance traveled by the air over a period of time and known values for density of air. This results in a substantially constant airflow rate through the horn. As the air from the high pressure side is exhausted from the acoustic horn, air from the low pressure side of the piston is allowed to pass to the acoustic horn. The air from the low pressure side of the piston passes into the acoustic horn at a substantially constant velocity through the same route as the high pressure side of the piston. This substantially constant airflow rate through the horn is disadvantageous for acoustic and sonic applications.
Further drawbacks of prior art systems include inefficiencies and complexity in creating air pressure oscillations in fluidics systems. Typically, the air pressure oscillations are created by pumping a high pressure fluid through a reciprocating air piston. The reciprocating air piston causes a corresponding low pressure fluid to be drawn through a resonating chamber in fluidics and/or a conduit. Once the fluid fills or nearly fills the resonating chamber, the air piston is reversed in its stroke to pump the low pressure fluid through the resonating chamber and conduit. Unfortunately, the volume of the fluid between the two ends of the piston when it reverses direction varies over a very short amount of time, for example, during the stroke of the air piston. This causes uneven pressure oscillations to be produced by the system. The uneven pressure oscillations are more pronounced at frequencies of greater than 100 Hz.
Another drawback is the use of large horns in fluidics systems. It would be advantageous to have fluidics systems in which small horns can be used for greater flexibility and reduced costs.
While fluidics have been implemented in the control of noise in some applications, there are many drawbacks. In many cases, it is very difficult to obtain a suitable output, particularly when acoustic horns are used as a part of the fluidics system. It would be advantageous to have a fluidic system that can be used in a wide variety of applications and which is not limited by the size of the acoustic horn.
It would also be advantageous to have a fluidic system which can generate a more stable output. Many prior art systems exhibit unstable characteristics, which makes their implementation impractical. Some prior art systems also cause high levels of broadband noise, which is generally undesirable and which is a result of the use of acoustic horns in fluidic systems. It would be advantageous to have a fluidic system that can reduce the amount of broadband noise.
It would also be advantageous to have a fluidic system that does not produce significant sound energy in the 200-1500 Hz range because noise in this range can cause people to lose hearing. It would also be advantageous to be able to use a fluidic system without introducing high-level broadband noise in order to have a more stable output for the control of noise in various environments.
Thus, there is a need for a passive noise control system that does not generate excessive broadband noise and is cost effective and efficient. There is a further need for a fluidic system for the control of noise that is not limited by the size of the acoustic horn, which is not limited by the output level and is easily implemented without the use of acoustic horns. There is also a need for a fluidic system that generates a more stable output. There is a further need for a fluidic system that does not cause high levels of broadband noise. There is also a need for a fluidic system that can be used to generate desirable sound without the use of acoustic horns or other large horns. There is also a need for a fluidic system that does not generate a significant amount of sound in the 200-1500 Hz range. It would also be beneficial to have a fluidic system that can reduce or eliminate broadband noise.
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to systems and methods for the active control of noise. One embodiment of the present invention provides an improved fluidic system for active noise control. The improved fluidic system includes at least one resonant cavity. The resonant cavity is fluidically connected to an acoustic horn through a fluid path such that an airflow through the horn may resonate the acoustic horn. At least one resonator is used to modify the frequency spectrum of the acoustic horn. This can reduce the size of the acoustic horn and allow for an increase in the overall size of the system. Thus, the present invention may be used in a variety of locations without the cost and size limitations imposed by some prior art systems.
A first aspect of the invention involves the use of acoustic wave attenuation or damping devices in a resonant cavity to actively control the acoustic sound pressure levels or frequency content of the acoustic horn. For example, one or more Helmholtz resonators may be used to attenuate the acoustic signals propagating through the resonant cavity. The number of Helmholtz resonators used will depend on the acoustic wave frequencies being controlled and the acoustic resonance modes present in the system. Thus, using this aspect, it is possible to have a small system, which allows for a cost-effective design.
In an embodiment, the fluidic system includes a fluidic amplifier, which allows a fluid to be used as an active medium. This embodiment provides additional benefits, including not having the traditional requirement of a large acoustic horn, as well as having reduced broadband noise and increased efficiency. The fluidic amplifier also provides increased flexibility, as well as allowing a wide range of resonator geometries and frequencies.
Another aspect of the invention provides for the use of at least one passive resonator in the fluidic system. The passive resonators may be either Helmholtz resonators or acoustic attenuators. It is also possible to have a combination of Helmholtz and acoustic attenuators. The resonators may be distributed throughout the fluidic system. It is also possible to have a combination of Helmholtz and acoustic attenuators.
Another aspect of the invention provides for the control of noise utilizing a combination of Helmholtz and passive resonators. As</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:21
