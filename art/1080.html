In the early 2010s, Disney had acquired the company which held the Star Wars franchise, and wanted to produce a sequel trilogy to the original three films in the franchise, originally to be released between 2015 and 2017. During the development of Episode VII in 2014, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy expressed the desire to set the film's events following the next film, but Abrams chose to move the timeline forward by three years, which made the next film take place between Episode IV and V. Following the release of The Force Awakens, Abrams discussed how the films will be set approximately 30 years after Return of the Jedi, saying: "The Force Awakens picks up after 'Return of the Jedi' and ignores the 30 years in the 'special editions', so we're set 30 years after we think the battle of Endor. So we see the end of the old Republic and the birth of the New Republic. And we see that the battle lines are drawn - it's a very personal story." In a September 2017 interview, Abrams elaborated on the possibility of revisiting earlier chapters of the Star Wars story, but also revealed that one of the primary reasons for choosing the 30-year jump was to "give [Abrams] the opportunity to put the Skywalker saga on hold for a little bit."
