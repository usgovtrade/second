Our customers have an intimate knowledge of the ways they’re working on their business, what their needs are, and what they’re trying to achieve. This isn’t something you get from customer surveys or focus groups. With Bizly, you have a chance to build a relationship with your customers and let them help you, on a day-to-day basis, with what they’re doing and the value they get out of our platform.

We hope that by getting closer to customers and hearing their day-to-day challenges we can grow in new ways with them. This is especially important now that the Bizly product is mature. What used to be a new product concept for us will soon be standard product. You see new innovations happening all the time in your industry — from e-commerce to machine learning — but we can’t do them without customers’ help. That is how you’ll find ways to add new features, and how you can innovate. We rely on our customers as critical elements in our platform development process.

What Clients Say

“Bizly is one of the top Salesforce App Partners. In fact, Bizly is so committed to our business that they have invested time and money into a strategic partnership with us. When their Salesforce Engineers created an integration app for us, they worked closely with our engineers to ensure the app was compatible with all our customizations and we are now implementing it into the CRM. When other partners recommended to us to change our Sales Process to a Buyer’s Journey based on the best practice, they were the first to successfully implement the Buyer’s Journey in Salesforce and deliver on the commitment to move us to the next level.”</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:54:03
