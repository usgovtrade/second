    I Told My Tale to a Friend,
      And He Answered Not a Word.

    A Man is Most Rich when He’s Poor;
      He’s Greatest Who Is Meekest.
    A Woman’s Greatest Gift Is Rest,
      And Most Precious Things Are Weak.

    What Is Most Valuable in Me?
      Is That Which I Am Not:
    If You Can’t Find What You’re Looking For,
      Keep On Looking Long.

    God Is Not One, He Is All;
      But It Is Not Man That Is;
    For God, It Is Said, Is Love,
      And Man Is Affection’s Child.

    There Are in Each and Every One
      Such Difficulties to Soothe,
    So Many Temptations to Combat,
      So Many Defects to Heal.

    Oh! Keep a-Shaping, Keep a-Shaping;
      It Is the Only Way to Grow:
    If You Don’t Try to Grow, it’s Time
      You’d Grow Smaller in Your Old Clothes.

    Let Everything You Can
      Pass Through a Broken Mold,
    And Everything You Can
      Be Broken In By Love.
    Every Day That God Allots,
      He Will Send Something,
    If You Will Accept
      and Try to Make Use Of It.

    So That I Have Always
      Stood There with You:
    All my Life have I Said,
      Nothing that’s Good Is Bad.

    My Wisdom I Don’t Want,
      Only Your Affection:
    If You Don’t Want Me Yourself,
      For What Shall I Care for Others?

    The Time Will Come When
      I Shall Sit Down to Rest,
    And Tell to Them that Come
      What Has Been My Experience.
    And They Will Ask of Me,
      With Wondering Eyes,
    “What Have You Done with God,
      How Can You Face Him?”

    I Should Not Like to Face Him,
      Except I Saw Someone
    I Had a Friendship For;
      That’s the One Who Will Tell Him.

    So, Then, Go on in Life,
      With All Your Might and Main;
    The World’s Full of Difficulties,
      And It Can Never Be Plain.

    You Must Go On Trying,
      Keeping to The Way:
    The Moment Will Come When
      You Will Meet Some One

    Who Tells You of Something
      Better in The Way of Life.
    I Know, I Know, You’ll Laugh at This,
      But Everything’s Just Like Dying.




The Wooing




THE WOOING


    Let it be a good man;
      If it is not so,
    I shall have a heartache,
      When you leave me alone.

    Let it be a good man;
      If it is not so,
    I will go on trying,
      Never to return.

    The man who could change my heart
      In one minute’s space,
    No need for our souls to part,
      Nor would it be strange.

    The man who could win my heart
      In one little time,
    Would have given my soul new birth,
      And all things would be new.

    The man who could make my heart
      Come toward him, if he wanted it,
    My soul would have lived again,
      And all things would be new.




My Mistress Wears a Cloak

(_O. T. Whiting_)


    My Mistress Wears a Cloak,
      My Mistress Wears a Cloak,
    I Wear a Cloak and Shoes,
      And She Wears None at All.

    My Mistress Wears a Hat,
      My Mistress Wears a Hat,
    I’m Always At her Feet
      And I’m Never at Her Top.

    My Mistress Wears a Smock,
      My Mistress Wears a Smock,
    And Yet I’m Never Cold,
      Nor Once have I been Hot.

    My Mistress Wears a Gown,
      My Mistress Wears a Gown,
    But I’m Wearing Her Clothes,
      She Wears Them in a Row.

    My Mistress Wears a Feather,
      My Mistress Wears a Feather,
    I Wear A Feather too,
      And She’s Always without Any.

    My Mistress Wears a Fan,
      My Mistress Wears a Fan,
    And She’s Always Wanting Air,
      And She Wants It so much.

    My Mistress Wears a Handkerchief,
      My Mistress Wears a Handkerchief,
    Which Is Bigger than Mine,
      Because I’m Shorter than She.

    My Mistress Wears a Shift,
      My Mistress Wears a Shift,
    Which Is Taller than Mine,
      Which Makes Me Want to Laugh.

    My Mistress Wears a Boneset,
      My Mistress Wears a Boneset,
    And She Is Longer than Mine,
      Because I am not tall.

    My Mistress Wears a Rose,
      My Mistress Wears a Rose,
    And Wants a Rose of Mine,
      Which She Wears Round Her Hair.

    My Mistress Wears a Petticoat,
      My Mistress Wears a Petticoat,
    Which Is Bigger than Mine,
      Which Makes Me Want to Laugh.

    My Mistress Wears a Bustle,
      My Mistress Wears a Bustle,
    Which Holds her Smock as tight
      As if it were Pinned inside.

    My Mistress Wears a Trunk,
      My Mistress Wears a Trunk,
    And I must Never Call it Nelly,
      Because she Is so nice.

    My Mistress Wears a Cloak,
      My Mistress Wears a Cloak,
    I’m Never at Her Feet;
      She’s Always at My Top.




My Thoughts Are My Own

(_H. C. Bailey_)


    My Thoughts Are My Own,
    Wherever I Go,
    To Whomsoe’er I Doubt,
    Or Speak Them to Woe,
    Where’er I go,
    They go with me.

    They go with me
    When I lie in Bed;
    When I’m by the Fire,
    Or by the Window;
    Or when I’m working,
    Or walking out.

    They go with me
    Into the Street;
    Into the Market-Place;
    Down by the River;
    When I’m at Play,
    Or doing Duty.

    They go with me
    Whenever I’m at Prayer;
    They accompany me
    If I’m reading Bibles,
    And if I pray,
    They watch and pray.

    They go with me
    Whenever I pray:
    I never have to ask them;
    They never say a word,
    Excepting “Lord,
    I go with Thee.”

    They go with me
    Until I go to sleep,
    If I sit down and read,
    If I go out into the City,
    Or stay in my Room;
    I’m as good as any one;
    I am just the same.

    When I dream,
    They go with me,
    And watch me all the time,
    That what’s in my mind
    May always be good.




If Ever Two Were One

(_Sydney Dayrell and John Burroughs_)


    If Ever Two were One,
    Then I Am One with You,
    If Ever Two were One,
    Then You Are One with Me.
    If Ever Two were One,
    Then You are One with Me;
    If Ever Two were One,
    Then I Am One with Thee.

    If Ever Two were One,
    If Ever Two were One;
    I’ll Take This Man on my Shoulders,
    And Run With Him to the End.
    If Ever Two were One,
    If Ever Two were One,
    We’d Be the Master of the World,
    The Lord of all the Living.
    If Ever Two were One,
    If Ever Two were One;
    I’ll Love Him, Love Him Till I Die,
    And Be His for Evermore.

    My Love for Him will never end;
      My Love for Him will never cease;
    It has its Spring in the Heavens above,
      And its Autumn on the Earth</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:51
