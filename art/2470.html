Tyler was one of the first celebrities to be interviewed and congratulated for his win by Ryan Seacrest on Good Morning America, along with his co-winner Jessica Sanchez and third place finalist David Archuleta.

"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity," he said, describing his music career as something that has always been in the back of his mind. "So, this is amazing."

Ryan, who had already interviewed Ryan, Jessicn and Taylor later, got to congratulate all of the Idol finalists on how well they all did in the competition.

"You guys just put on a performance for the ages," he said. "And I gotta tell you, that was the best performance I've ever seen you three sing live. Ever!"

The three former Idol contestants were interviewed on Good Morning America after their appearances on the Dick Clark show, as part of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve event.

"I've been in love with this show since I was 13, or younger. This is like my high school reunion, and I am absolutely thrilled to be here. It's amazing," said David.

"This is the greatest show in the world. I'm blown away to be on the show and see what it's all about," he said.

"I'm so excited. This is kind of a crazy dream come true," said Jessica.

The competition for the new judge of American Idol has been intense since former judge and singer Paula Abdul's sudden exit at the end of last week.

In recent days, it has been announced that Simon Cowell will be joining the judge's panel. There has also been some talk about Randy Jackson being thrown into the mix as well, but a day later, it was announced that Randy had signed a contract to return as the American Idol stage host.

A few contestants had auditioned for American Idol on the Dick Clark show, with most of them having done so in the past. Last week, two of them were eliminated before Ryan Seacrest arrived to judge the first episode, but this week, all six finalists are currently competing on the show.

For Idol's first performance show on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve show, all six contestants will sing.

On the show, Randy Jackson announced that the six finalists would be singing the same song, with the results of their performance then being posted on a screen.

Then, they were joined by Idol judge and musician Justin Timberlake, who sang part of his hit single "Cry Me a River" with the six contestants.

The first group of six is Jessica Sanchez, Matthew Roberts, David Archuleta, Ace Young, Haley Reinhart and David Cook.

Ryan Seacrest says that he has had some difficulty this year in getting the final group of six American Idol contestants to practice.

"They've been up on the roof with Justin Timberlake," he said, according to the Los Angeles Times.

"And when I called them down, all they wanted to do was go to the set. So, they've been partying a lot," he said.

Seacrest also had some difficulties in getting the sixth finalist, David Cook, to return to the judges' round. It was supposed to be a final round for Cook before Ryan was forced to eject him, since Cook apparently didn't complete the terms of his contract when he declined the offer.

"When I got there, they were in party mode, doing 'Candy Shop' by 50 Cent," he said.

Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest airs on December 30, 2011 at 8:00 p.m. ET on ABC.

Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve is hosted by Ryan Seacrest, Al Roker and Julie Chen. The show will be broadcast live in the Eastern and Central time zones. In the West, it will be live in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and tape-delayed in the Mountain and Pacific time zones.

During the show, Dick Clark will get to meet some of the most famous singers and songwriters of all time, including Justin Bieber, Adele, Jay-Z, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars.

For the first time in a while, a reality TV show seemed to be a true reality competition. This past season of American Idol, the show's ratings were down from past years.

"American Idol wasn't the same. Our numbers were down," said Simon Cowell. "We had some other problems in this last season, and I think that caused the numbers to go down."

Cowell said that other problems included the firing of judges Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson.

"They were quite nice to their judges," he said.

It also seemed like Randy Jackson, who is not only the stage host for the show but a judge, wasn't present at some of the final auditions to give advice to the hopefuls. The producers of American Idol tried to explain Randy's absence, saying that he had to work, but Randy said that was a lame excuse.

"I wish the contestants got some advice from their judge. We want to keep it at least 60% business. It's an entertainment show, and we want to make it entertaining," said the American Idol producer, Simon Fuller.

In spite of Randy's firing and his absence during some of the auditions, most of Randy's panel of judges appeared to be happy to see him return to the show. Randy later told People that he had signed a contract for another season of American Idol.

American Idol's ratings were down, according to the Nielsen ratings system, and it ranked at number forty-one for the 2011-2012 season. That was a fourteen place drop for the show, which has aired on Fox since 2002.

Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve will be taped at New York's Times Square.

The new judge of American Idol is Randy Jackson, who told People that he will do the show until the end of the year.

"I have signed a contract for the rest of the season, and I am not leaving until that contract is finished," Randy said. "The show needs me."

At age 56, Jackson was an original judge on American Idol, which he remained with until he was fired at the end of last season. However, he returned to the show last summer to help choose the new judge, as part of the show's competition.

"I came here to be a judge, so I want to do this. I really wanted to be here for another season," said Randy.

He will do the judging for every competition from now until the end of the season. According to Randy, he will still be doing shows for his own charity, also known as "Jumping For Kids" and "Jump's House." Randy also is part of a Broadway show.

"I'm having a great time. I just wanted to come back and help someone out," said Randy. "As I look back, I feel like I'm still on my game. I'm having fun."

Randy says that he loves the interaction he has with the hopeful singers on American Idol, even if it is just for a short time.

"That's the real trick. You get to let loose, but at the same time, you have to keep control," said Randy.

Carson Daly was the first to announce on December 1 that Randy Jackson, a panelist on American Idol, would be returning to the show.

"We are so thrilled that Randy will be the new judge, and is already taking this show back up to what it should be," said a spokesperson for the show.

In an interview with People magazine, Randy said that the deal with the new judge will be made on the same terms that were offered at the beginning of the season.

He also commented on his firing last year from American Idol. The season's ratings were down, according to the Nielsen ratings system, and it ranked at number forty-one for the 2011-2012 season.

In a statement, Randy thanked American Idol for giving him a chance.

"I am thrilled to be back. I am honored. I have a blast every time I am there. I just had a chance to speak to the producers, and they told me that I will be back for the rest of the season."

American Idol viewers are now focused on the judges' seat, with Randy returning to the show, and his fellow judges Jennifer Lopez, Steven Tyler and Keith Urban, also in discussions about returning. Some fans are now worried that American Idol will change, with the judges no longer being on the same level as the contestants.

"I think they are going to be in much more control this season," said Sharon Osbourne, one of the judges of American Idol, in an interview on a radio program. "In past seasons, they were very supportive. They were really good judges."

However, others are very happy that the new judge has been named.

"Randy Jackson is a great addition to the team. He will be the first person to help shape the next season of American Idol," said one</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:34
