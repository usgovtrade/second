"It's Just Not My Job." "We're All Guilty of Thinking About Ourselves." "But For Every Time You're Thinking About Yourself," "There's Someone Else Thinking About Your Daughter." "My Daughter's 6." "Oh, This One." "Well, I'm Not a Good Villain." "Not Yet, But I Can Always Learn." "I Told Them To Give You That Sublimating Cola," "But They Put This In It, And It's Actually Gonna Hurt Me." "I Guess They Didn't Really Listen To Me After All." "It Just Would Have Made You Happier." "Yeah." "Happier, Right." "No, No, No." "What Did You Do To It?" "We--We Didn't Do Anything To It." "We Want To Believe You, But You're Giving Us So Little." "I Don't Know What Else To Tell You." "It's You, Isn't It?" "Yes." "Yeah, It's Me." "I Am Doing All Of This." "And I Do Love It, And I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way," "But I Know How Hard You Work," "So You Never Have To Give Up Anything" "A Nice Home And A Good Life" "You Don't Give It Away" "Your Life!" "Is That All The Food We Have?" "All Right, Everyone Into The Car!" "How Long Will They Be Stuck Here?" "Oh, Just For The Night." "You Know, There's Actually Something To Be Said For This." "How Bad Are We Looking?" "Well, You Wouldn't Want To Lose A Head," "Not Even An Orange One, Because They're Tricky To Grow." "Or Is It Stupid To Be Losing These Kids On Such A Beautiful Day?" "Yeah." "All Right." "This Is How I See It." "We Were Given The Sublimating Cola As A Gift" "From Somebody Who Loves Our Kids." "I Thought I Knew That, And Then I Took It Away." "Well, Why Don't We Just Get Back The Sublimating Cola" "And Give It Back To Our Friend?" "Yeah, That's The Thing." "I Know How Lousy These Kids Are Without Their Cola," "But What's It Gonna Take To Get This Back?" "Um, We Would Have To Raise A Million Bucks, And We Don't Have That Kind Of Money." "Are You In Or Out?" "I Never Left, Mom." "Well, What If I Take The Kids And Go To Sea?" "They'd Never Leave You." "We Have The Candy Bar, Popsicles," "And All The Other Necessities." "Well, You'll Need A Better Boat This Time." "Oh, I'm Gonna Have A Better Boat." "My Next Big Score..." "Will Be On That Boat." "What?" "He's Going Back On The Sea, After The Money He Owed Us." "If He Drops That, He Could Go To Jail." "He Shouldn't Have Taken Our Money." "No, He Shouldn't Have Took Our Cola," "But I Guess That's Part Of Being A Good Finder." "We're Not Bad Parents." "It's Not The Money." "It's The Subtext Of What We're Doing." "In My Day," "We Had To Swear We Were Doing Something For The Kids," "And This Kid," "He's Only Thinking About Himself." "Hey, Don't Worry About It, You Know?" "I Feel So Guilty." "And Why Are You Still In Custody?" "Well, I Didn't Have A Valid ID." "You Have A Valid Cue-Out Number." "I Have To Find Work." "I Can't See You All On This Cruise." "Well, We Might Find Another Way" "To Work On The Cruise." "That's A Nice Thought." "But We Should Have The Kids Upfront In The Fall." "I Wish I Could See Him Again Before He Left." "Me, Too." "And Him." "He Couldn't Stay Long." "The Boat's Leaving In A Minute." "I'll Be Watching You" "And Everyone Else From This Side Of The Water." "Okay." "Hey, Guys," "I'm Making A Special Request This Time." "Are You Sure You Got It?" "My Son!" "Oh, We Got It Right Here, Son." "We're Going To See Dad!" "Yes, We're Going To See Dad!" "What--What--What Is Going On?" "Whoa!" "Whoa!" "Heading South By Southeast." "I Don't Remember Signing Up For Any This." "What Are You Doing To Our Kids?" "I-I-I Don't Even Get A Chance To Keep The Bribe Money?" "Okay, I Can Help You." "Just Tell Me What You Want." "Get Me Out Of Here." "How Bad Are We Looking?" "We're Going To Have To Raise $3.5 Million If We're Going To Sell This Place." "That Doesn't Help Me." "Well, I'm Selling The Condo For $350,000, Not Even Half." "I Can Get Six Figures For This Place," "But It's Like I'm Selling A Ghost House." "Well, They're In The Wrong Side Of Town." "It's Hard To Sell A House In A Weird Place" "That People Just Aren't That Into," "Especially On A Beautiful Day." "Well, These Kids Are All I've Got." "All Right, But What Are You Going To Do?" "What?" "I'm Going To Take My Cut, And I'll Give You Whatever You Get." "You Want To Buy My Kids' House?" "If It Gives Us A $4 Billion Cash Buy-Out?" "Yeah, $4 Billion." "Well, You Could Buy The Whole Town For That." "Yeah, I Think We Have A Better Chance Of Giving All These Kids A Better Life Than All You Pigs." "So Who Wants To Get Out And Walk This Line," "And Who Wants To Stay Home And Watch The Telly?" "Hey, Mom, How Much Does A New Sailboat Cost?" "More Than You'll Ever Make In Your Life." "Well, Why Don't We Go In And Look At The Boats?" "Mack And Sully Can Help Us." "My Parents Say I'm A Spoiled Brat," "But I'm Not." "I'm A Smart Spoiled Brat." "And I Know I'm Not Gonna Ever Be Free," "So I'm Gonna Put Away Some Money While I Still Can." "Hey, How Was Your Day?" "What Did We Just Get Into?" "We Didn't Get Into Anything, Sweetie," "Except You Dropping That Bar" "And Going On About Everything But Our Kids." "We're Done With That Kind Of Talk." "We're Done Talking." "We Have To Do Something." "You Have To Take Care Of That Cola." "It's All I Hear About." "We Bailed You Out, Too." "It's Time To Take Care Of Your Responsibilities." "That's The Only Way You'll Ever Be Free." "Well, I'm Not Going To Let You Do That Again." "Maggie, There's This Really Rich Guy" "That Might Pay $4 Million For Our House." "That Is No Rich Guy." "It's Our Son." "I Gotta Go Call The Real Estate Guy." "What's Going On?" "It's Your Daughter Who Decided To Sell The House And Move To A Condo." "We Think It's The Sublimating Cola" "That Did It." "Okay, This Is Out Of Control." "There's No Taste Left." "The Whole Thing Is Just--It's Dead To Us." "I'm On My Own, And I Haven't Seen You Guys For A Couple Of Weeks," "So I May As Well Move Out." "I Am So Sorry." "You're Sorry?" "You Took The Sublimating Cola" "From Our Kids Without Even Giving Us A Warning?" "I Was Just Trying To Be Nice." "I Was Just Trying To Keep Up." "How Would You Like It If We Took One Of Your Kids?" "So What's It Gonna Take To Get Our Money?" "Yeah, We Will Talk To You Real Soon." "You Know What?" "That Was Your Last Chance, Dolly." "Good To See You, Mr. Cooper." "Take Care Of Yourself." "So I Can't Say I'm Not Glad To Hear You're Gonna Be A New Dad." "I've Always Dreamt Of Giving Kids A Better Life Than My Own." "Well, You Must Be Excited." "I'm Not So Sure." "I Wonder If You've Ever Taken A Moment" "To Think About How It Could Be Different" "The Kind Of Dad I Could Be For My Son Than How He's Known?" "Well, I Don't Think I Have." "I Mean, It Isn't For Everyone To Be Your Son's Father" "Or A Husband Or A Teacher," "And Those Who Do It For The Rest Of Their Lives"</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:04
