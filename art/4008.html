In the field of inputting data for text processing, such as word processing and the like, machines for entering data and instructions often include keyboards and key pads. The keys and keypads are generally connected to electronic circuitry that controls the operations of a data processing apparatus. In operation, data may be inputted by manual manipulation of the keys or keypads. For example, data may be inputted into a word processing system by touching the tip of a pen to a button, and then depressing the button with the pen as the pen is placed against the page being written on. To enter data into a graphic tablet, similar manipulations are made on keys, which are provided on a board positioned within the tablet. The keys are connected to the electronic circuitry within the tablet that controls inputting of data into the tablet. To input data, the tip of the pen or a separate stylus is placed on a position on the tablet corresponding to the position of a button on the keyboard. A signal is sent to the processor, to instruct the processor to detect the position of the pen, and then input the data in the position on the tablet corresponding to the position of the pen on the keyboard.
To control the operation of the tablet, the user generally must have some knowledge about what functions the particular tablet provides. In order to operate a tablet, a user must also have some knowledge about which button on the keyboard corresponds to each of the keys on the tablet. With a tablet, a data processing apparatus is difficult to learn how to use without first taking an initial tutorial course. Even with a user that is familiar with the operation of a tablet, an individual user will generally have difficulty in using a tablet in conjunction with a word processing system because of the need to familiarize oneself with the layout of a keyboard or keypad on a tablet.
As such, tablet devices have limited use in any computer-related application. However, use of a tablet device with word processing or other applications that involve the input of data into a computer, would provide significant benefits to users, particularly those users who may be unfamiliar with operating keyboards and keypads. The use of a tablet device would also provide significant benefits to users that may not be adept at reading the information on a computer screen. For example, those users with only partial vision, or that are not adept at reading using the eyes, would find tablet devices beneficial to their efficient use of computers.
Furthermore, tablet devices offer capabilities that are substantially different from the capabilities of keyboards. The present invention is a system and method for entering data into a computer using a data entry device that is different than a keyboard or keypad. Because a person is generally accustomed to inputting information in one form, such as by using a keyboard or keypad, the present invention offers a more intuitive user interface. A tablet device may be used with computer applications such as word processing, in which the user is provided with a screen to type on, and a tablet on which to make writing or drawing inputs. A stylus may be used to press buttons or otherwise input data into the computer. The stylus may also be used as a writing tool to input information onto a form that may be connected to the tablet. While a stylus is primarily used for writing on a screen and is not necessarily used to input data into a computer, the present invention allows for writing and drawing inputs to be used for data input as well.
In the present invention, a pen is generally used with a form that has a plurality of areas on which to write, and/or a plurality of areas on which to make other inputs, such as drawing inputs. The areas on which data may be written generally comprise text, but are not limited to any one form of data. One or more areas on the form may be used for writing data, and a second area on the form may be used to write a title for the area that is being written on. The system for selecting the areas is referred to herein as a xe2x80x9cnavigation systemxe2x80x9d for selecting areas, and comprises a navigation device. The system may be configured to allow the user to select an area for writing, and automatically switch to an area for entering data, in which the writing pen is also being used as a data input tool, such that the user may have one hand for entering data, and the other hand for writing or drawing.
Therefore, in one aspect of the present invention a form is provided. The form includes a plurality of areas to be written on. Each area has a first region and a second region. The first region includes text information. The second region includes a visual indicator that identifies the area. The visual indicator is provided in one of a plurality of colors. The form also includes a data entry device for inputting data into the computer. The data entry device is substantially different from a keyboard or keypad. The data entry device is configured to write data onto the form.
In another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for writing data onto the form. The method includes defining areas for writing, and identifying the areas. The method further includes using a pen to write data onto the form, and using a data entry device to input data into the computer.
In another aspect of the present invention, a system for writing data onto a form, is provided. The system includes a plurality of areas on the form, each area having a first region and a second region. The first region includes text information. The second region includes a visual indicator that identifies the area. The visual indicator is provided in one of a plurality of colors. The system also includes a data entry device for inputting data into the computer, the data entry device being substantially different from a keyboard or keypad, the data entry device being configured to write data onto the form.
In another aspect of the present invention, a system for writing data onto a form, is provided.

The second region includes a visual indicator that identifies the area. The system further includes a data entry device for inputting data into the computer, the data entry device being substantially different from a keyboard or keypad, the data entry device being configured to write data onto the form.
In another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for using a tablet device to input data into a computer, the tablet device having a plurality of areas on which to write, and areas to be written. The method includes indicating areas to be written. The method also includes selecting one of the areas on which to write, by indicating the area to be written, and moving a stylus in accordance with the indication of the area to be written, to create writing in the area to be written.
In another aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for using a tablet device to input data into a computer. The system includes an area indicator for indicating areas on a tablet device on which to write. The system also includes a stylus for writing on the areas indicated by the area indicator, and an electronic processor for detecting and inputting writing into the computer by a user touching the stylus to the areas indicated by the area indicator.
It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a method and system for writing data onto a form.
