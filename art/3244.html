The movie has a five percent approval rating with one hundred and thirty-three reviews.

There’s a reason why it was given the “rotten” rating, as TubeFilter explains. “The worst part of the movie is that its content has nothing to do with a bad movie. Yes, it’s a typical zombie movie, yes it’s gory but it also has a heart and a story which is what I didn’t understand.”

Funny how you don’t want to be seen with something which contains “blood, guts, guts, blood, guts, blood, more blood, guts and guts.”

However, there are moments which elicit even more extreme reactions from Internet users. “One of the things which made me wonder was the scene where the kid in the movie is talking with his little sister and tells her that he’ll be right back but as soon as he says that a zombie kills him. It just didn’t seem right that someone who was 11 years old would have been talking to a little sister who he was just dating,” TubeFilter said.

“Or perhaps there is a deeper level of thinking in the movie. Something which doesn’t involve just sex or violence. Even though the character looks young, he is supposed to be only ten years old and yet it’s more realistic to believe that he is of 11,” TubeFilter added.

It all comes down to parents, TubeFilter believes. “Perhaps the movie is talking about teenagers and being able to deal with everything. Maybe kids aren’t going to go through all the horrible things that happen in this movie in real life but the most you can do as parents is teach your kids not to give in to death or what might happen, like drinking.”

Apparently, the makers of “Deadly Visions” failed to reach out to its intended audience. Perhaps if they’ve done this, TubeFilter believes, “Deadly Visions” would have earned a better reception.

It’s not hard to see why TubeFilter is one of those who have a problem with this movie. I mean, who has a nine-year-old kid that talks to a ten-year-old girl? Do they even talk to each other? I must be a lot more perceptive than the filmmakers were.

The makers of “Deadly Visions” would probably have said, “If only I had a child.” That’s if they cared. Perhaps it is because they don’t that it bothers TubeFilter.

This week in horror movies…

“The Cabin in the Woods”

This isn’t the first time someone has explored the zombie apocalypse with a group of college students who are also high school students. In fact, there have been plenty of zombie movies centered on a group of young adults like the ones in the series “Zombie High” which has been quite popular in the last few years. But, does “The Cabin in the Woods” have the edge over the others?

The short answer is, no. While it’s no “Pineapple Express,” there is plenty of blood and gore and violence, some of which is gratuitous, even a little over the top. However, just like “The Cabin in the Woods” has its share of cliches, the other films that we’ve come to expect in this genre also have its share of flaws.

Yet, despite the predictability of the film, “The Cabin in the Woods” is an enjoyable horror film that packs quite a punch for those who are in for a good scare. While it didn’t really do too well at the box office, it did earn a Best Horror Film from the jury at this year’s Fantastic Fest in Austin.

In “The Cabin in the Woods,” five students volunteer to spend a week in an old cabin in the woods, only to discover it has secrets and more horrors than just zombies. The film is directed by Drew Goddard (known for films like “The Martian”).
