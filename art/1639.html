What is Americana?

The term Americana encompasses all kinds of music: blues, folk, bluegrass, R&B, soul, country, rap, funk, jazz, gospel, hip-hop, pop and rock, for starters. It covers black, white, Asian, Latin and Middle Eastern performers.

The Americana Music Association, a US-based organization, defines Americana as music that’s defined by authenticity, heartfelt emotion and the traditional cultural roots of the Americas, including the deep South of the US and Latin America.

Where does Americana stand in 2016?

The Americana music scene is as vibrant as ever. It’s also constantly changing, depending on who is popular and where and when a tour will take place. So, the most popular acts on the Americana music scene will be here in 2016.

“Dylan is everywhere.” – Jack White

The Americana Music Association reports that Dylan’s Desire at Carnegie Hall was a financial success, while Dylan himself performed many of the songs from Desire (songs from 1965 that were included on the album along with a handful of earlier songs).

Dylan’s Desire sold out before the show started, and all three shows were sold out as well.

“I’m going to go see Dylan at least twice this week.” – David Crosby

Dylan’s Desire is his sixth studio album, and it’s his first studio album since 2012’s Tempest. In that time, Dylan got married, had a child, had a daughter and took time off from performing for a few years.

A lot of big artists on the Americana music scene played at the Newport Folk Festival in 2015 and 2016, including Dylan, David Bowie, Elton John, Dave Matthews Band and Jason Isbell.

The “Big Three” will be at Newport Folk in 2016: Dylan, Bonnie Raitt and The Del McCoury Band. The three acts are touring together, including at the Newport Folk Festival.

“If Dylan had never picked up the guitar, he’d be a great painter.” – Stephen King

Dylan’s Desire has more reviews on Metacritic than any other record, with a 100% rating. Dylan’s music reviews overall are pretty positive, but this rating is off the charts.

Will you see any of the five big acts at the Americana Music Festival and Conference in 2016? You can count on seeing a lot more in 2017. In July and August, Bonnie Raitt and Steve Earle will tour together as a duet.

You can watch the Americana Music Festival and Conference in the videos below.

“As you can see, we haven’t lost our love of folk music. We’re into all kinds of Americana.” – Kacey Musgraves
