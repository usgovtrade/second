You would think that every person, regardless of weight or beauty issues, would welcome this.

It all boils down to this: A look at the newly released Dove Campaign for Real Beauty.

I am not a consumer of commercial media—at least not in the current way. I just don’t see the need, really. I have lived all over the world and haven’t come across much of anything that could convince me that the standard of beauty in society is right. So why bother? And as for the commercial media, what kind of a thing is that?

That being said, I don’t think they are doing a disservice. They have just gotten it wrong, and it is unfortunate, because millions of girls and women can and do benefit from such a positive campaign. Some are not lucky enough to have the financial resources to get medical attention. For them, this is a big deal.

According to the Huffington Post,

“The new Dove body positivity campaign, called “Evolution,” features women of all shapes and sizes and represents the company’s effort to shift its campaign focus beyond its typical focus on hair and skin beauty to body and beauty.”

I don’t want to be too critical of a positive approach to the whole body image issue. As parents, we have been through it all, and we have done some terrible things. I know too well the consequences. We know, too well, the devastating effects on our daughters, and the ripple effects. It is terrible, all around.

But that is only part of the story.

I have also been there for hundreds of women who were told they were too fat.

They were asked where the fat was in their breasts, arms, legs, face, tummy, and they felt bad. Some felt awful about themselves. Others, like the women whose stories I told above, went for the surgery, without knowing why. The surgeon explained that they were unhappy because of their bodies, but they would be really unhappy when the surgery was over and they felt bad for doing it in the first place.

So they went for it, and it was never enough.

In my mind’s eye, I see the hundreds of thousands of women going for bariatric surgery who are dissatisfied with the results. I see the hundreds who are still dissatisfied. And I see all of us going back to dieting and bingeing because of the wrong kind of pressure from others and ourselves.

I am speaking of those of us who have had bariatric surgery, who are still recovering, and for whom, as they start to heal, the world is still not kind.

I am also speaking of those of us who have tried to lose weight through dieting and exercise without success. After all, not everyone can afford weight-loss surgery, so why try to go after the “skinny” girls?

I am speaking of all the people who have taken the time to write me, to tell me that they see beauty in the fuller-figured woman and that they don’t care what society says about looks, weight, and beauty.

It is because of all of the people who have come through my door that I have come to know what I know. I could write a book about it.

But I won’t. I am making a start.

I challenge all of you, on your own level, to reflect on this message of beauty and give thought to the implications. To look inward at what makes you beautiful in spite of your imperfections. To look at your inner beauty, the one you were made with.

And to share your thoughts with me. I would love to hear from you.

This is a great post! I think many of us know that the definition of beauty in the world today has become the one defined by anorexic thin women, people who have had plastic surgery, or starlets who are in the public eye. I have known for a while that there is so much “pressure” on women to look a certain way. And this has led to a growing crisis in our culture as well as a growing need for those of us who are bigger but still feel beautiful. Thank you for this post.

About Me

I am a very happily married mother of two. My family is my most important interest in life.
Writing is one of my very favorite activities, and I keep up with writing whenever possible. Along the way, I picked up photography, which is a very new and exciting part of my life. It brings a whole new way to express myself, and I love it. In fact, that is what this blog is primarily about, expressing myself through words and pictures. I have two blogs, one about my writing (my first novel, YA fantasy "Serafina and the Black Cloak," is under way) and the other about what I am learning about photography.
I am a history buff, a self-proclaimed artist (although my husband says not really...), a passionate bookworm, and a wannabe gardener. I love cats, and sometimes I even take care of them. I live in an old house that needs a lot of work, which I enjoy doing myself, but it sure makes for a tired hubby. Fortunately, there is a lot of history and beauty in the old house that is worth preserving. I also love quiet mornings when I can actually hear the birds singing.
