The use of computers to assist and monitor schizophrenic patients has been on the rise in the past few years. A computer-based home monitoring system was installed in the home of a paranoid schizophrenic patient who refused to accept psychiatric treatment. Results showed the proposed system could be used to obtain a better understanding of the patient's inner psyche and improve the quality of care provided. The results also indicated that the use of a computer can improve the patient's mental state. This study shows that the monitoring system for the paranoid schizophrenic patient was effective in improving his mental condition and improving his life quality. The study also showed that this computer-assisted monitoring system could effectively monitor the patient's activities and health status. With this information, it can detect deterioration of the patient's health early and provide timely treatment. Based on the results, the patient's clinical symptoms began to improve significantly. The proposed home monitoring system could also be used in community clinics to monitor the mental status of patients. Future studies could focus on using this system to improve the patient's daily life.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:05
