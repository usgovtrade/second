The two runners-up were a few hours older than those that received $1 million in funding.

But the winner, Kunal Bahl, who created an educational iPad app that has been downloaded more than 9 million times, didn’t even graduate from high school.

Despite having never attended school before he got his MBA from Dartmouth College at 19, Bahl was named the inaugural winner of the Google-Classroom Challenge, which asks students worldwide to create an innovative online tool using Google Apps for Education tools.

In a video, Bahl said he plans to go back to school and wants to get a medical degree.

"I am so pleased with the fact that we are doing this for students around the world, to help them learn online,” he said in the video. “I'm going to help as many people as I can."

The nine winners of the challenge will now split a $1 million prize from Google. All nine will also be awarded a trip for two to Google headquarters in California this summer.

The other three winners of $50,000 each include:

• Mashayekh Matin, age 10, from Alexandria, Egypt, who will use the money to build a library for children in his community.

• Reham Abdel Fattah, age 13, from Alexandria, Egypt, who will use her money to build a library in her village.

• Michael Wang, age 17, from Taiwan, who will use his prize to support a local non-governmental organization in the U.S. that works with youth around the world who are unable to get an education.
