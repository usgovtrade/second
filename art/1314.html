And because The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan loves the band Nirvana, he wrote "Aneurysm" in homage to it.

"I grew up in a time and place where there were very few musical outlets for me to digest. I was also a big reader, a comic book collector, an old pulp fiction fanatic, and especially I loved watching old movie rarities, and old Saturday morning cartoons. And as I read more and more fiction from all different genres, I've come to love the language of music as much as any other literature out there.

"As a musician myself, I have grown to love the language of music as much as I love the words, and when it comes to songwriting, it's not just words, but the way those words sound coming out of your speakers that creates all the moods and the emotions that are meant to be created.

"As I got older and grew into my own, I got to see the words to 'In Bloom' on the back of the Nirvana Nevermind album, and they really stood out to me as the perfect song to say a whole lot in such a small amount of time. As I became a more complex person in my mid-teens, so did my interest in Nirvana's music; it was so dark and it just represented something pure, and very real, and honest. It was music of the people, with no bullshit.

"I saw a picture of Kurt Cobain holding a copy of the Smashing Pumpkins' Zeitgeist album, and it just kind of hit me: 'He gets this.'"

—Billy Corgan

## "Aneurysm" by The Smashing Pumpkins

I tried to explain it to you in the bar

Before you ever went home with the guy I really hated

Said to you, I said: "What kind of lover are you?"

And you were just like: "No!"

And now, in the years that pass

I watch as you try to become yourself

And while it all falls apart

I have to smile, for the love we had

We were just like: "Fuck you!"

I used to be a man, oh, I used to be a man

Who was not meant for this world, who was not meant for this life

You and I could never make it, but it's alright

'Cause I know that you can make it alone

And now you are like me, I see the way you look at him now

As he tries to kill himself the same as he tried to kill himself for you

It's not that you don't know me, oh yeah

I used to be a man

Who was not meant for this world

You and I could never make it, but it's alright

'Cause I know that you can make it alone

And now you are like me, I see the way you look at him now

As he tries to kill himself the same as he tried to kill himself for you

And now I hate him the same as I hated you

I don't feel the same as I used to

I don't know who I am, I just know that I'm not him

And I don't love you anymore, 'cause you can't have what you can't have

And you don't love me anymore, 'cause he is the only one

We both saw it when we looked at each other then

It all became so clear in the light

There is an enemy of the light, here is his light

Who walks the line between night and day

I used to be a man, oh, I used to be a man

Who was not meant for this world, who was not meant for this life

You and I could never make it, but it's alright

'Cause I know that you can make it alone

And now you are like me, I see the way you look at him now

As he tries to kill himself the same as he tried to kill himself for you

And now I hate him the same as I hated you

I don't feel the same as I used to

I don't know who I am, I just know that I'm not him

And I don't love you anymore, 'cause you can't have what you can't have

And you don't love me anymore, 'cause he is the only one

We both saw it when we looked at each other then

It all became so clear in the light

There is an enemy of the light, here is his light

Who walks the line between night and day

There is an enemy of the light, here is his light

Who walks the line between night and day

And now I hate him the same as I hated you

I don't feel the same as I used to

I don't know who I am, I just know that I'm not him

And I don't love you anymore, 'cause you can't have what you can't have

And you don't love me anymore, 'cause he is the only one

We both saw it when we looked at each other then

It all became so clear in the light

There is an enemy of the light, here is his light

Who walks the line between night and day"

## "Suck" by Nirvana

When I was young and you were young

You got your kicks from the Kama Sutra

And dancing the tango

Who will love you then when you're old?

Then we grew up and you got fat and ugly

But I wanted you anyway

'Cause you were pretty when I was young and you were young

I was sure we'd get married someday

But we didn't

We didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't get married, now

Well, why don't you try to get along with me now?

When I was young and you were young

I got my kicks from the Kama Sutra

And dancing the tango

You and I were born to be lovers

And everybody in the village was scandalized, yeah

'Cause they didn't understand the way that we felt inside

And then the way I made it real clear that I was with you

I left your body with you, too

And went sailing down to Never Never Land

With Davy Jones

Well, why don't you try to get along with me now?

Well, why don't you try to get along with me now?

When I was young and you were young

I got my kicks from the Kama Sutra

And dancing the tango

I felt like I lived a charmed life

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stay as brave

Now I'm living in a foreign land

And my friend has taken up with a whore

And your wife, as you recall, was an actress from the MGM lot

You were good in St. Joan, but I never cared that much for you, baby

"Well, why don't you try to get along with me now?"

When I was young and you were young

I got my kicks from the Kama Sutra

And dancing the tango

And I got my kicks from the Kama Sutra

And dancing the tango

And I got my kicks from the Kama Sutra

And dancing the tango

"Well, why don't you try to get along with me now?"

When I was young and you were young

I got my kicks from the Kama Sutra

And dancing the tango

"Well, why don't you try to get along with me now?"

## Nirvana

Nirvana was an alternative rock band that was formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987 by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain, guitarist Krist Novoselic, bassist Krist Novoselic's younger brother bassist and sometimes-guitarist Dave Grohl, and drummer Chad Channing, whom Cobain had known from high school. The name Nirvana was taken from the D. H. Lawrence novel Lady Chatterley's Lover (1893), which concerns an affair between a young English noblewoman and an aristocrat's gamekeeper; Kurt Cobain wanted a name that suggested "something from a different culture... something with an interesting history," as he explained in a 1992 interview with Mojo.

For years, Nirvana's career was one of great ups and downs. During its formative years, Nirvana was signed to DGC Records—the Geffen imprint of the major label giant Geffen Records—for which the band recorded the first of three landmark albums with legendary producer Butch Vig, Bleach (1989), Nevermind (1991), and In Utero (1993).

Nirvana had released its first two studio albums, Bleach and Nevermind, and the following year,</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:46
