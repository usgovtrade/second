This is my first time to your blog!I know it will be one of my regular ones now :)

I love this, I love how crisp the colors are, I especially love the watercolor feel of this piece, I love the way that the water is running along the edges and it keeps the feeling that you had painted it, I even love the way you do the light on the top, the light is just so perfect! Fantastic job.

I found your awesome blog through a group on Flickr and I must say your work is amazing, I am actually quite a sucker for watercolor.

Hello from Germany!I love the watercolor effect in your painting! I tried that for a long time and always failed. I find your work stunning - itÂ´s easy to understand that it took you a lot of time and effort to create this piece. Keep up the good work!Sabine from Germany

I love it! Such a simple idea that gives it a whole new dimension. In fact, I started a series of paintings like this in watercolor when I worked for the state of California. I even used some of the exact same colors that you have in this one, using the pallete of the city it was a piece celebrating our history. I am really sorry I can't give you the link to my blog, but if you go through my Flickr pages you can see my work.

I have spent a lot of time trying to re-create watercolor painting digitally, with limited success. I would love to see a post with some of the tools you are using. Do you have a specific brand of watercolor paper that you love?

This piece is truly beautiful! I am so inspired that I want to learn how to use Photoshop and get better! Do you have any tips for watercolor artists to learn digital?

Oh my goodness! This is so amazing!! I'm so glad I found your blog because you are amazing at watercolors! =D

You're my new favorite watercolorist! Thank you for showing us the possibilities of watercolors! I was looking for some inspiration today, and this site is amazing! I know you take a long time creating these beautiful works of art, so be sure to take the time you need to create! Keep it up!

This is incredible. It's beautiful, but not overdone like so much digital art these days.I am currently re-learning how to use Photoshop Elements. I was wondering how many layers you had in this piece, and the total number of layers. This would be awesome! I just started from scratch, and it's getting to where I think I'm stuck in mud... I'm going to start small, and hope for the best, lol.Thanks!

Hi, I'm not a watercolor artist by any means, but I want to try it out. It looks like a lot of fun and I can definitely do it with less mess, so thank you for sharing. I love how you used only a couple of colors, but it really makes the whole painting seem alive. I just want to have one of these and hang it in my living room.

Hi! I'm a big fan of yours,I'm a photographer in Ecuador. I love this piece and I think that if the same technique you used to create the water, I made a nice art piece. I have not been working in digital so I'm very interested in your style. Thank you and keep doing your work.

Love this. I'm an illustrator & digital artist, so I dabble with various mediums for design and am always looking for other artists with different styles. The style you create is so beautiful. I can't quite place the style though, would you mind giving me a hint where the inspiration comes from?

This is such a gorgeous piece, and it seems so simple. I love your water technique. I'm thinking I might experiment with it. It would be fun to use some of my acrylics and oil paints, too, to have some different effects going on. Thanks for the inspiration!

Your painting just made me very happy. It's so simple, but it's so beautiful. I could feel the water running down the side and feel the sunlight. Such simple style with great result. I love how it creates a feeling of a place.

Thanks for the inspiration. I use Paint Tool Sai for my watercolour-style doodles, because it's easy and intuitive, but you make your work look more amazing than my usual doodles. I can't wait to try this!

Thank you for sharing your techniques. This is just awesome. Like the other comments, I have tried my hand at watercolour but it has been disastrous so far. Now with this, I'm sure I can finally master it. Thank you.

I don't normally leave comments, but you have an awesome blog and an amazing art style. I read it daily and just love the simple beautiful pieces of art you paint. It's one of my favourite things to do on my iPad. Your work is awesome and so inspiring. I love it, as do my friends, family and coworkers. I'm so happy to be able to have this opportunity to tell you how much you're doing with your art. It's so true; a lot of us only have a few simple things in our lives that can be made extraordinary. So grateful I've found you. I'm off to share the link to this amazing art to my social media pages. Enjoy your day! Thanks.

I absolutely adore this painting, and your blog! If I could give you this amazing feedback, I would! Please, please keep sharing your work. Every time I read your blog I feel inspired and eager to learn new techniques!

I have tried and tried and tried to learn digital painting. I found this site by sheer accident. I have watched all of your videos so far and am very impressed and inspired. My goal is to become a very good digital painter. Thanks so much for your amazing tutorials.

I see that you don't post your paintings often. I'm an illustrator and I love these simple images. I've tried many techniques to make digital painting look this way but never got close. I think I have found my next technique.

Beautiful, perfect watercolor painting! I'm planning to try painting like this some day too. But like other readers have said, I just really admire the way you paint water, so soft and smooth without any brush strokes at all. I don't have much experience with watercolor though, but this helped me a lot. Thanks a lot!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:43
