What is your best vacation/travel memory?

It’s my favorite day of the year – I get to take a long drive in the middle of winter! There’s no better way to spend a night than in the company of good friends and great music. I’m also very fond of traveling to the coast.

How would you describe your ideal itinerary to go around the world?

First I’d go to Los Angeles and then take a long road trip west to San Francisco. There’s so much I’d want to do and see in San Francisco. Once there, I’d go to Joshua Tree to see the sunrise, then Palm Springs, then La Jolla, then Santa Barbara, then Santa Monica, then back home.

What’s your favorite destination?

I love the beach but also appreciate the outdoors. I like hiking, backpacking, and skiing. But mostly I love watching the sunset and the view from the summit of a mountain.

What is the most memorable trip you’ve been on?

It’s hard to choose just one, but in my mind, it would be our annual trip to the beach when I was around 7. I recall us getting lost on a bike ride. We found a great seafood restaurant and ended up hanging out with the locals at an Irish pub, where I learned to play pool. There was an amazing band playing and when it came to an end we all found ourselves riding on the back of a motorcycle to the beach and ended up in downtown Miami – all in the course of one night! I’m not sure how we managed it but it was quite an adventure.

How does a perfect day with your partner begin?

A perfect day with my partner usually starts with a lot of great sex. We both enjoy a long sensual bath before going to bed. After a big shower, we get into bed together and talk about our dreams and what the other wants to do. By the time we both fall asleep, we have a plan for the day.

How do you unwind from the day?

Unwinding can be as simple as going to dinner and a movie. I also have a ton of fun hanging out with friends, playing games, and going out.

When you travel, how do you relax and find your center?

When you travel, how do you stay true to yourself while also adjusting to new situations?

First I try to make time to get to know the culture. Then I just have to learn to find the language of the culture. I know a lot of French but very little Spanish, so I had to immerse myself to learn Spanish. I also really love to travel to India, which is such a beautiful culture. When I go, I try to leave my iPhone and iPad in the hotel. I love how everything is so simple there. And even when I travel abroad, I like to cook meals at home, which is really not possible while traveling.

If you had to pack one item and one item only, what would they be?

I couldn’t imagine traveling without my phone. And I couldn’t imagine traveling without a scarf to keep me warm.

If you had a chance to do anything, what would it be?

I would live in the Outer Banks in North Carolina in the summer with my girlfriends – soaking up the sun, relaxing, eating great seafood, and making art.

When you travel, how do you stay true to yourself while also adjusting to new situations?

It’s hard when you have people you love around you. However, the first trip I ever did as a travel professional was to Morocco with friends I had made when I was working in DC. The group of us traveled together for four days and explored a new country. This showed me how much you can get out of travel when you have like-minded people around you.

Tell us your most significant travel memory.

I like to travel because I like to see the world and experience other people and cultures. There have been some special moments. One of them was the first time I traveled overseas with a group of friends. We flew from the UK to Sydney, Australia, and we had a blast. There were 15 of us, all from different parts of the UK. We each brought different people from our group that we met in our hometowns in the UK. There were about eight different nationalities. This is how I got to meet a lot of the British people that I still know today. I love that everyone made new friends and we all just took the time to be happy and appreciate the different cultures around us.

What’s your best travel story?
