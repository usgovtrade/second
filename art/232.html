Instead 
of being a positive, I ended up saying 
I'm feeling a little vulnerable because I'm so far away from home.
But what would have been better would 
have been to say I'm being inspired.
I believe she had been working really hard 
before, she had the stamina and all that 
but this has really inspired her.
Now let's look at the following example. I
am planning on having a little look on 
Instagram while I travel and I want to 
show my son my adventures and my travels.
So first of all, she's feeling inspired 
by her son. A good sign.
She just made a mistake.
She said I am planning to.
That's almost the same as, I am going to.
Second of all, she's looking forward to her plans.
Let's take a look at the next example.
I am planning on seeing the Grand Canyon 
from the top of a mountain.
I am so excited.
Well, I can't think of what she could 
possibly say after that.
I am so excited?
But as I said, maybe she was planning 
to show me the Grand Canyon from the top of a mountain.
Because something very exciting is 
happening on your side, maybe you're a 
basketball player. Maybe you have the chance to be chosen for a 
tournament or a final or something.
That's why we go on travels.
But it didn't work out. We had no 
chance to see it, but I am so 
excited about my new job.
It was a mistake.
Well, even better. I'm excited.
That's because she's working on something 
very exciting and it's good for her 
because she loves that.
Well, I don't understand what she's excited 
about, but if it's something good 
for her that should be something good.
I'm excited about my new position.
I'm already so excited.
It was a mistake.
It doesn't sound great to me.
I'm very excited.
OK, for her, we don't know.
It could be good for her, 
it could be bad for her.
We don't know. It doesn't 
matter, but I am so 
excited about my new position.
Now let's look at the third example.
The final thing I have left is the following.
I'm so tired, I am so tired of my 
life, I feel so horrible, 
I wish I could die.
It's not the question that you 
really want to hear, 
but at least you're being honest.
So let's take a look.
Maybe she's going to lose her job or 
maybe she wants to work less and she feels 
she is just way too busy.
It's not the right day for that one.
If you are tired of your life, it 
would be better to make a schedule.
It would be great to have a plan, 
it would be great to have the focus on what 
is important for you.
The last thing is it's all about thinking, 
we talked about that in the first video.
But to be honest about the things 
that really matter.
She is telling it like it is.
These are the things you want to be
able to say when something is 
going on with you.
But now, we are finally getting to the 
things that we want to learn from the 
beginning of the video.
In the last step, we talked about what 
it really matters. But when you really 
do matter, you will have the power, 
the courage and the strength to take action.
Even if you are tired of your life.
You will say I am strong.
You don't need to convince anyone.
This is one of those things that is 
already known, but we are going to 
learn a little bit more, we will 
discuss a little bit more, 
because when it comes to stress 
people have so many doubts, 
so many different things going on 
that they don't even know if they can 
make any difference in their situation.
We already know how to do that.
But what would you do if you don't 
need to convince yourself first.
How are you going to look at this one?
My husband always tells me, 
you're strong.
Good for you.
Is he proud of you?
So yes, we don't have to convince 
ourself that we are strong.
What do you want to be?
You need to think about the things 
that really matter.
There are a couple of things you need to do.
First of all, the most important is 
to know who you are.
What I mean is that there are 
certain things you need to know 
and certain other things you can easily 
learn about yourself.
We talked about that in the previous step.
We saw that, but you have to figure 
out who you are first, 
because when you know that you are a 
very different person in the morning than 
you are in the evening, you need to know 
what you would like to be in the evening.
If you were a woman that had 
children, you'd be different.
I have a daughter. If I had a son, 
I would be different.
If you were a man and you had a spouse 
and you had kids.
If I am going to tell you who you are, 
it's basically to know where you are going, 
it's to know who you are already.
You need to know your character and 
then you can make it better, 
because at the end of the day, it's all 
about your own attitude.
It's not about someone saying, how could 
you be like that? No.
If you were the one saying how could 
you be so strong? The most important thing is, 
who you are and you need to figure that 
out first, then you can make it better, 
because if you are not satisfied with 
who you are, you won't be able to 
make it better. That's the problem.
It's because you're not satisfied, that 
we have a lot of things to blame, a lot of 
mistakes. It's not because it is a lot of 
mistakes and things to blame and everything 
because we are not being satisfied.
We are saying it wrong, but when it 
comes to happiness, it's always about 
who we are.
We are not saying it is a mistake 
when it comes to happiness.
Because we all know that most 
of the things that we do, or we don't 
know that we can change, we can change 
them. If you don't like the 
soup, you can ask for a different soup, 
but you can't have your dream partner, 
your dream job, etc.
If you are a woman and you love 
men, you can't change that. 
That's something we don't 
talk about that much.
It's something we should talk about 
more often. We are so used to that 
when you are a woman and you are trying 
to please the man. If you don't please 
the man, if you do something wrong, it's 
considered to be a mistake.
You are trying to be someone you are not.
But if you do something wrong, it's a 
mistake. But if you are a woman who loves 
men, it's your problem.
What is that a mistake?
We can do a lot of things, but 
if we don't know who we are, 
we can do the things that 
we like or we don't 
like, but there is no reason to 
talk about that.
We are just talking about how to 
be a very strong person.
There's no need to mention about how 
to be a very strong person.
There's no reason to not 
know how to be a very strong person, 
if you only know what you don't like.
That's the problem.
You are so used to being unhappy 
and it's always about, well, 
I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe it's the wrong food, 
maybe it's the wrong person, 
maybe it's a mistake, 
maybe it's the wrong 
partner, I don't know.
Maybe I don't know how to ask for 
what I really need or want.
The first thing is to know who you are.
I talked about this in the previous video.
We talked about that.
This is one of the most important steps 
in our journey.
I don't know if you noticed, but 
I said the first two times that 
this is a very challenging path.
We have to be very honest</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:17
