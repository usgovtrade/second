In response, a security officer told her that if she did not calm down she would 
have to find herself a new attorney. 
          As they continued to argue, she continued to curse and threaten everyone in 
the room and called the deputy and assistant chief officers who had come to secure 
the room “assholes” and “fucking idiots.” One of the officers who had come to 
secure the room moved her from the table to a chair.
          After being seated in a chair, Gaston threw some file folders on the floor in an 
apparent attempt to injure Officer Lopez. Lopez tried to regain control of Gaston 
and her chair, but Gaston struck Lopez on the left hand. Officer Lopez told 
Gaston she had been cut. Lopez then requested that she be transferred to the 
booking area so that her hand could be treated.
          While another officer was helping her walk, Gaston told him, “Don’t touch me, 
you fucking pig” and hit him with her purse. After being put into a wheelchair, 
Gaston kicked her chair into a wall, spitting and cursing loudly. Gaston was 
then taken to a medical area so she could be treated.
          In the meantime, Lopez told Sergeant Moulton she could handle Gaston 
herself and she did not need to go to the emergency room. Gaston was then 
walked to the nurses’ station. It is at this point that the videotape ends.
          The next day, Gaston filed an inmate grievance about the incident. She 
alleged that she was hit by her chair but she did not complain of any injuries.
          After receiving medical treatment and treatment for a cut on the finger she 
had split open, Gaston was returned to the county jail. She was charged with 
assaulting a county jail officer, an offense for which she was convicted after a 
bench trial.1 She was also charged with battery to an inmate, a state jail felony.2

§§ 38.03 and 45.11(a).

The trial court convicted Gaston of the charged offenses and assessed a $3,000 fine.  The trial court then sentenced her to three years’ imprisonment, probated for four years, a $500 fine, and thirty days in jail. 

On appeal, Gaston challenges only the trial court’s imposition of community 
supervision.

III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW

A.
       Community Supervision

Trial courts have broad discretion to determine the conditions of community 
supervision.3 When the conditions imposed are challenged, the appellate court 
will review the record in its entirety, applying an abuse of discretion standard of 
review.4 A trial court abuses its discretion when the conditions are not reasonable 
and they have “such an effect on the probationer’s liberty and reputation that they 
may be quite significant and for that reason he or she is being put on ‘short 
leash.’”5

B.
       Requiring Drug Testing

The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides that after a finding of guilt, a trial 
court may suspend a defendant’s sentence and place the defendant on community 
supervision.6 The Code also requires, however, that the trial court require a 
defendant to submit to drug tests as a condition of community supervision.7 
This means that once a trial court determines a defendant should be placed on 
community supervision, it has no discretion but to impose whatever conditions it 
determines to be reasonably related to the defendant’s rehabilitation and his 
abiding by the law.8 An order requiring submission to drug testing is not an 
abuse of discretion as long as there is evidence in the record that connects the 
defendant to drug usage.9 This is particularly true in this case where Gaston was 
convicted of a crime related to narcotics use. 

C.
       Evidentiary Review

An appellate court reviews a trial court’s decision to revoke community 
supervision for an abuse of discretion.10 In conducting its review, the court 
reviews the evidence presented at the revocation proceeding in the light most 
favorable to the trial court’s order.11 

1.  
Improper Fact Finding 

A trial court abuses its discretion if it permits the fact finder to make an inference 
of guilt from an inference of illegal conduct.12 Thus, a finding that “the defendant 
was reasonably believed to have committed an offense, even if that offense was not 
proved beyond a reasonable doubt, is evidence from which the trial court may 
infer that the defendant violated a condition of his community supervision.”13  

When a defendant’s guilt for an offense which gives rise to a condition of community 
supervision is contested, however, the inference that the defendant committed the 
offense cannot be inferred from a finding that the defendant violated a condition of 
his community supervision.14 This is because a finding that a defendant violated the 
conditions of his community supervision cannot establish guilt for an offense for 
which there has been no trial.15 

Because of this limitation, courts of appeals have held that once the 
defendant raises the issue of the alleged conduct, it is the State’s burden to 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt the commission of that conduct if the defendant’s 
guilt for the crime that gave rise to the conditions is contested.16 In holding this, 
the court of appeals recognized that the State is not required to meet the burden of 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt when it seeks the revocation of a defendant’s 
probation.17 Similarly, this Court has held that it is within the trial court’s 
discretion to revoke a defendant’s community supervision for a violation of the 
conditions, even if the community supervision was not proven to be improper.18 

2.  
Findings Based on Improper Presumptions 

Having reviewed the record in its entirety, the court of appeals held that the 
trial court abused its discretion because its finding that Gaston committed the 
offense was not supported by the evidence.19 The court of appeals could not find 
that the trial court’s finding was reasonably supported by the record because the 
trial court admitted into evidence Gaston’s video statement without requiring 
the State to authenticate it, Gaston never denied using narcotics, and Gaston 
never presented witnesses or other evidence that would have cast doubt on the 
State’s allegation that she violated the terms of her community supervision by 
failing a drug test.20 

After stating that “Gaston offered no evidence that would cast doubt on whether 
she used the drug-test stick,” the court of appeals held that the trial court 
therefore concluded that “Gaston was dishonest when she denied drug use to her 
community supervision officer.”21 The court of appeals held this violated Gaston’s 
due process rights and violated rule 804 of the Texas Rules of Evidence.22 We agree.  


2.  
Proper Legal and Factual Findings 

The trial court heard testimony from Gaston that she tested positive for cocaine 
use and that her community supervision officer told her that she tested positive 
for cocaine. The trial court also heard testimony that Gaston refused to take a 
drug test. The trial court was, thus, in a position to determine whether Gaston 
violated the terms of her community supervision by failing a drug test. The trial 
court expressly stated that it found this allegation to be true. It also ordered her 
community supervision “suspended” based on this finding.

We agree with the State that Gaston is bound by her affirmative plea of “true” 
to the charged violation of the conditions of her community supervision. In 
Pitonyak v. State,23 we held that where there is a plea of true, the accused is 
estopped from complaining on appeal that the evidence presented failed to establish 
his guilt.24 Because Gaston freely, knowingly, and voluntarily pleaded “true” to the 
violated condition of her community supervision, we agree with the State that 
Gaston is estopped from challenging on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence 
supporting this determination.25 

Based on the foregoing, we agree with the court of appeals that the trial court 
abused its discretion by ordering community supervision revoked based on 
insufficient evidence.26 

3.  
Imposition of Illegal Sentence

We must now determine whether the court of appeals properly determined that 
Gaston’s sentence must be vacated.27 The State argues that Gaston has waived her 
complaint by failing to object at the punishment phase of her trial. We do not agree 
that Gaston has waived her complaint. The court of appeals reviewed Gaston’s 
sentence and found that it exceeded the statutory maximum.28 

It is true that a trial judge’s actions generally may not be challenged for the 
first time on appeal,29 but even though Gaston waived her right to a jury trial, the 
punishment phase of her trial occurred</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:14
