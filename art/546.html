simplify our work in this area, while at the same time 
provide significant new benefits to our global customers.

As a result of this change, both the description and 
the sample of the new attribute will change on August 
29th.

We'll continue to describe the same general attribute, 
but with different levels of detail in our documents. 
On December 31st 2001, we will begin using the new 
"tag" to replace our descriptions.

Customers will see the same attribute names on the web, 
in EDI, in documentation, and in data, all with the same 
meanings.  The "definition tag" and tag number will 
appear as part of our XML schema.

The attributes will now have a fixed, simplified sample, 
helping us resolve problems when that data isn't used. 
It will no longer be used to define more specific data 
or sub-attributes.

The simplified attribute values will eliminate complex 
dates and times, and "date formats" which were previously
used to define attributes that need to be uniquely defined
for each individual company. Instead, the same simplified
attribute will apply to all customers.

The following list contains the simplified attributes
(currently scheduled to be implemented on December 31st
2001) and the attributes they will replace.

All simplified attributes will follow this form:

<Mileage attribute="1" numberOfUnits="0.0" 
    unitOfMeasure="EACH_BUSHEL"/>

List of Simplified Attributes 

<Mileage attribute="1">Each bushel by weight.</Mileage>
<Tons attribute="1">Each ton by weight.</Tons>
<Tons attribute="1.0">Each short ton by weight.</Tons>
<Millions attribute="1">Each million pounds.</Millions>
<Cwt attribute="1.0">Each hundredweight by weight.</Cwt>
<MetricTon attribute="1">Each metric ton.</MetricTon>
<MetricTon attribute="1.0">Each short metric ton.</MetricTon>
<Barrels attribute="1.0">Each barrel by weight.</Barrels>
<Count attribute="1">Each count per piece.</Count>
<PoundsPerPiece attribute="1">Each pound per piece.</PoundsPerPiece>
<Yard piece="bushel">Each yard by weight.</Yard>
<PiecesPerYard attribute="1">Each piece per yard.</PiecesPerYard>
<DryCorrected attribute="1">Dry corrected each bushel by 
weight.</DryCorrected>

While this change may not seem dramatic to some, 
the resulting simplification and consistency will 
greatly ease our work. As always, thank you for your 
business and support.

Regards,
Pete May
