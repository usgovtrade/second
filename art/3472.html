Andy: He gave up his home in the desert and came to the valley for all the right reasons. And we got him home, that’s a beautiful story.

Lori: It’s a story of family values. This is an organization that was started by some great people in this area.

Andy: I think what resonated with me about this story and what I wanted to do was I want to support this family.

Lori: I want to help this family, this man has been a friend of mine for years and years. We helped him and his wife get off the street.

Andy: The program here in Arizona, we get these people off of the streets and help them make a change in their lives and get them to move in a new direction that they might not have gotten in if they were still on the street. So that’s what drives me to do this, you know, we’re just doing good. I mean really good.

Lori: I mean it’s a wonderful family, this is a guy that is dedicated to his children and, and he has six of them, I believe. I can’t remember how many. Six with another coming so I’m sure he’s going to be doing a lot of changes around here, I think.

Andy: I mean we started with one and we now have 25 people living out of his home, living in this building, so that’s a lot of energy coming in and helping us to rebuild this program that can help people be able to get their lives together.

Lori: That’s really fantastic. So I mean what we’re seeing here is all these people and if you were to walk outside here on a Saturday morning, you might even think that it was Sunday. It’s a great sight to see because people are coming in to get food. I mean people are coming out of the buildings, I mean this is where they came from, homeless, and here we have them living and thriving here and so I can’t say enough good things about this place.

Andy: My goal and my plan, as well as Lori’s, is to try to get a home that we can just renovate. That will take a lot of money but I would just like to help somebody and when you can, you know.

Lori: You have to do it.

Andy: It’s something that you can never do enough, give enough. This is a great cause that I think we can support and people can come together and be able to do something for this man, who lost his life and his wife to a drunk driver, at least get them out of their suffering and get them to the United States. They can be with their children and then we can help them, we can all support them, so I think this is really important, what we’re doing.

Lori: I’ve had the pleasure of knowing him over the years. I think everybody in our community has known him. I think he’s a guy that if you ask him to do something, he’ll do it, I think that’s part of his character and that’s why he works so hard. He’s got such a passion for this work and because of this great work, he’s building this center that can help so many people. I mean he has a great sense of compassion for people and his message is one that I just hope everybody can get behind it.

Andy: I want to make it known that we are building a home that is safe for people, that you’re safe when you come to this center and all these people, and because of that, a lot of people are going to see that and it’s going to change their lives, they’ll go out and they’ll start living, that’s the way it works.

Lori: That’s the kind of change we want to have.

Andy: What we’re trying to do is help this man to make this a safe home for these kids and then there will be more outreach to come and get involved in.

Lori: One of the first things that happened when I walked into this facility is I actually saw a man sitting down, I see this all the time, and I see people sleeping all the time. And so I walked up to this place. And I sat down and started talking to one of the participants there.

Andy: Yeah, these are people that have been homeless but are looking for a better way and now because of the efforts of Lori and myself, I hope that there’s no other person that is homeless, looking for a home. I think with all the work that we have here and our support that we have with people, we should be able to do this. So, thank you very much.

Lori: Thank you.

Andy: Thank you.

Lori: I’m here to help and I think that’s the greatest thing that anyone could ever do. Just to help in any way, just to come out and help in any way, so thank you very much.

Trevor: That is Lori Dohner from the Phoenix Shelter for the Homeless. She gave us the tour of the facility. She has the heart of a true leader and I love that she’s here to help us get back to doing what we do best, which is helping people every day. So thank you very much, Lori. Thank you very much.

Trevor: Okay, let’s take a break for a few minutes and then we’ll be right back with more episodes.

Trevor: You’re listening to Building A Better Business with a Better Team on the radio. We’re talking to J.R. Smith, former star of the New York Knicks. You might have heard his name on television. We actually got to interview him on TV once when he was in town to play the Los Angeles Clippers and he was not getting many minutes or much help from his teammates, so he just kinda bailed out on the Knicks, if you will. So he came up to the Clippers and he put on a show in L.A., I guess, and that was probably one of the greatest, I’m gonna say it, performances I have ever seen. Anyway, today I got to interview him on how he got back into the NBA. He was drafted in the seventh round by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2002 and then he was traded to the Orlando Magic, and then I don’t know how you say, bounced around for a little bit. Then finally the Knicks picked him up in 2010, with Amar’e Stoudemire, he was a star forward. This was a team that I thought they were about to move the rock. But they got off to a hot start in the season and all of a sudden, I think they were 7-1 or something, I can’t remember. Anyway, they were 7-1. So this is what we know, J.R. Smith was in Orlando for those seven games. He got fired up and decided to play the best ball he’s ever played in his career. He ended up having this great year in New York where he actually made some really big shots for them and then that summer they traded Amar’e for nothing, basically, so that was kind of the demise of that team but now we have the J.R. Show in New York, and so I had a chance to interview him about it and learn from him, so today we’re gonna talk about his journey. His thoughts, we’re gonna have some success stories about the people that got fired up because of hearing him speak and what he shared in his speech and how he got back in the NBA. And I don’t know if you’ve seen his interview with Bill Cosby that we had on this program, but he’s got a really different style than a lot of the athletes out there. He talks just about himself and it’s all about him and how he thinks and we’re gonna have that interview with J.R., so stay tuned.

Trevor: Today’s episode, we’re gonna talk to J.R. Smith.

J.R.: So what we goin’ do?

Trevor: Let’s get into it.

J.R.: Okay.

Trevor: Alright, we had this podcast today with J.R., we’re talking to him about getting fired up and about his career and his thoughts and some things he can share with all of us. He’s having success on the New York Knicks and so he came up to the podcast. And let’s go straight to my phone calls. I have a great question from Chris who’s with the Milwaukee Bucks right now but he got fired up when he heard J.R. talk and he asked a question for all of us: You said that every time I set out to do something, I set out to find out who was really going to challenge me and set me off. So, for me, I don’t really care what people think about me or what they are talking about me. So if I’m gonna do something, I just go. I don’t</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:19
