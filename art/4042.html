The new cultivar was discovered by the Inventor in `s-Gravenzande, Belgium`, as a naturally occurring mutation in a batch of seeds sown by the Inventor in August, 1994. The value of this new cultivar lies in its overall appearance, clump forming habit and vigor, and cold tolerance.
The new cultivar has been propagated by basal cuttings taken at s-Gravenzande, Belgium and Apeldoorn, The Netherlands over a three-year period. The characteristics of this cultivar have been found to be stable and are true to type through successive propagations.
The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be basic characteristics of `Liberty`, which in combination distinguish this Poa from its parents and all other varieties of Poa known to the Inventor. These characteristics in combination distinguish `Liberty` as a new and distinct cultivar:
1. Its stems are stout and upright, clump forming, and resistant to winter wetness.
2. The inflorescences of the new cultivar produce red-purple spires.
3. The leaves of the new cultivar have a gray-green appearance with a gray margin.
4. The peduncles of the new cultivar are dark brown.
5. The leaf sheaths of the new cultivar are dark brown.
6. The plant habit is high and very clump forming.
7. The inflorescences of `Liberty` are red-purple in color.
8. The foliage is medium green with gray margins.
9. The stem color of the new cultivar is a medium gray with a red-purple tint.
10. The new cultivar is hardy to USDA Zone 6.
11. The lower leaves of the new cultivar turn golden brown in the fall.
12. The plant is highly tolerant to summer heat.
The new variety has been compared to its parents and to other varieties known to the Inventor. `Liberty` is similar to its parent `S.I.P.` in its plant height, vigor, and leaf color. However, `Liberty` differs from its parent `S.I.P.` in its lower leaf color. `Liberty` is similar to `S.U.C. `and `Sunrise` in both its plant height and habit but differs in having red spires whereas `S.U.C. `has red green spires. `Liberty` differs from `Sunrise` in leaf and stem color.
`Liberty` is similar to Poa pratensis var. aurea but differs in spire color.
`Liberty` is similar to Poa pratensis var. pulchra but differs in spire color.
`Liberty` is similar to Poa pratensis var. pulchra f. flavescens but differs in spire color.
The new variety has been named `Liberty`.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:08
