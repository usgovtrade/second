D. Heyward" & "Gettin' to Crunch Time" by "Elijah" are based on three separate recordings of the same song. The song "J. D. Heyward (Sings Just Between Friends)" contains elements of the song "Lovin' You Is Wonderful (Ladies and Gents)" from the musical, Pipe Dream. "Gettin' to Crunch Time" by "Elijah" is a parody of "Get On the Good Foot" by James Cleveland & Wynton Marsalis. The lyrics "It's like a tree with no root. All I do is keep on rolling 'round" are from the song "The Man I Love" written by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. The song "The Boll Weevil Standard (A Cappella)" borrows from the melody line of the gospel standard, "Trouble of the World". "Bless Your Heart" features some verses from the hymn "Rock of Ages" by Phineas D. Allen.
