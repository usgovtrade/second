measure demand for the products and services you offer. 
This method has been referred to in the literature as the Net Promoter ScoreSM 
(NPS), and measures your customer's willingness to recommend you highly. 
Based on recent research in customer loyalty, NPS is a quick and reliable metric. 
To implement NPS, all you need is a willingness to follow these three steps:

- Define your customer base and how to measure customer satisfaction.
- Ask customers for feedback.
- Follow-up with them if there is any opportunity to improve.

We've created a video and accompanying handout that explains NPS, and details 
our implementation.  If you would like to see the video, click on the 
following link.

The handout is also available to you by clicking on the following link:

Thank you for your time and interest in this matter. We look forward to your 
reply, and to your future participation in the Net Promoter System.

Regards,



Sincerely,


Kirk Kuykendall
Director
