As a professional surfer, he grew up in Southern California and California’s North Shore. In 1966 he won the US Surfing Championship. He was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated and Life Magazine. In college, he wrote a thesis on nuclear weapons and was a fellow of Harvard’s Center for International Affairs. He went on to work for two of the largest engineering firms in the world (AT&T and TRW), advising the US government on counterterrorism and weapons policy.

Amidst all this, Bob discovered a passion for nature and the outdoors. He went on a six month trek through Nepal, studying the Tibetan Buddhist culture. From there he embarked on an around the world bicycle trip (1980). In time, he was riding his motorcycle on the Mongolian border when his machine flipped. With his bike wrecked, he borrowed a horse and began walking back to the city he grew up in—Los Angeles. Along the way, he met a Japanese man on a motorcycle who took him to the small village where Bob was born. Bob lived in the village for five days while he connected with the people of Borneo, his father’s village, and his Chinese grandmother’s village. It was these three journeys that fueled his passion to create Alo’s.

In today’s world there is such a thing as “too much of a good thing,” and this applies to just about anything that you do or have. Just like everything else in life, though, moderation is good. Some of the best, most iconic watches in the world (Rolex Submariner, Omega Speedmaster, Breitling Superocean, and Patek Philippe Nautilus for instance) are the subject of this column. If you are looking for the perfect timepiece then these four have it in spades.

In reality a great watch is less about the brand and more about the combination of timepieces that the owner has selected. They will go together, not only look perfect together, but their respective functions and features will work perfectly together for the next hundred years. But as we said at the top of the column it is a sad fact that even a truly great watch can become too much of a good thing if not kept under control.

The first watch on the list is Rolex Submariner. This is the most popular Rolex watch because it contains an abundance of functions that combine to make the perfect timepiece. It is an understated, classy watch with a lot of charm but that is also full of great features. The 41mm case has three crowns that you can turn for quick adjustment. The date is in back and the date-display feature is easy to read. The bracelet is available in a number of different metals and is all the more comfortable with the addition of stainless steel straps. All-metal construction makes this watch more reliable than some others. It is also a very handsome timepiece, particularly as shown by our photo to the left. It is more casual than some and can actually be worn with a suit or with jeans and a t-shirt.

Next on the list is the Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch. They have a number of interesting and unique features, like a retrograde hand and the perpetual calendar. For a lot of people this will be a lot more than enough. In fact, if you are a Rolex fanatic and really want a watch for any purpose other than show, this is it. This is more a tool watch than one of pure style and elegance. The date can be set with ease, and the time displayed in 24 time zones around the world. It also has a GMT function, great for travelers. It has a caseback with three crowns for adjustment and a simple but attractive dial that has a silver ring around the edge to keep it all in place. This is an extremely durable watch with a great look that looks great in any setting.

We did mention Breitling and now we are getting to the next watch on the list. This time the watch is the Breitling Superocean. This is actually more than a watch, it is an experience. This isn’t your run of the mill mechanical timepiece that gives you a look at the date. No, this is about a two-hour flight in the cabin of a Boeing 747 and features a variety of features, including a digital display with a built-in compass that displays your position with respect to the compass. If you’re worried about your date changing and not paying attention, you need not be, since the date is read digitally and stays exactly where you tell it to. Even better, if the date changes in between the hour markers and the markers themselves, a bright red marker line will appear. It is a fantastic watch with great style and a lot of features for a very reasonable price.

And finally we come to our final watch on the list and this one really takes the cake as far as unique watches go. It is the Patek Philippe Nautilus. In the past this has been called the World’s most complicated watch and while it is a stunning timepiece, it certainly isn’t meant for just anyone. The first thing to note is that the case is made of carbon fiber and it is all the more impressive when you consider that all of the dial and hands are genuine gold, which is a rarity in today’s time. The dial on this Patek piece really makes it stand out as unique from any other watch out there and it is a true pleasure to watch this thing move around while you study its intricacies. Finally it should be noted that this particular watch features a unique self-winding mechanism for the escapement that makes the watch appear to move quite smoothly. It certainly looks expensive and is one of the most well-constructed pieces of gear you will ever see, but you should also be aware that it is certainly not the most practical watch out there. For instance, the price tag makes it suitable for people who want to wear luxury watches but not necessarily in the case of work-related functions.
