I wanted to make it a home for all of my friends, to celebrate with them, laugh with them, and share many a great meal.

The project was exciting for me; everything from the original fixtures, to the sink (a true work of art), the bar stools, to the furniture – it was a labor of love.

Each of these fixtures and accessories are from different makers in Bali. Most of the furniture and fixtures I selected from my friend Surya Yudha-Uy. It was my intention to also incorporate some pieces by myself that were made by me. They include: 1. Small, simple cocktail table that I used as a bar for food; 2. 2 large-scale cocktail tables, that we bought from Yakut in Ubud, 3. A big round table (on which Surya also played with me), to be used as a dinner table; 4. Stool, a high stool that is made by Surya; and lastly, a long bar-stool, also made by Surya. The glass countertop is from a local craftsman. All together, the bar and dining area seats 18-20 people.

Over the years I had many wonderful guests in my home, and I cherish the memories of making dinner for them in the same place, but in a different space. Every so often I was invited to events at Surya Yudha-Uy’s home, and it was a wonderful experience, for me, to meet the local communities and learn about the traditional values that exist there. I have always wanted to bring together community members of the world. Our world is getting smaller, which is amazing and a step in the right direction, but we still live in far away pockets of the globe, separated by borders and the walls we put up that stand against us. That was another part of my project – to bring people from different corners of the globe together.

Creating our first home – is such a complex, dynamic process; one that I will always remember for the rest of my life. What was important to me is that it was a reflection of who I am. I wanted it to be special, and different from all of the other homes I had been in, so that it would be a place where memories would be made, and in every possible way, make people feel at home. I believe I accomplished this.

Our home in Kuta is located in a beautiful villa complex, which was built on this spot by a famous Bali architect, I Nyoman Mujiono, whom we met on our very first visit to Bali.

Our home is surrounded by Bali’s most famous volcano – Batur. In the distance you can see the iconic rice fields and the green rice paddies. Just beyond, on the side of the road you can see the beach, with the rolling waves, a few beach chairs, and vendors selling everything from food, to fresh fruit.

We have many regular visitors who have all created wonderful memories for us here. One of our favorite spots is the beach. When it’s the right time of day, with a light breeze, there is just nothing better than to watch the waves roll in. This is probably why the sea has always been one of my favorite destinations. It allows me to be one with my surroundings, and feel truly present in the moment.

I love that as you drive into Kuta, you are immediately immersed in nature. The sea surrounds us, and the mountains are only a few hundred meters away, and you are just immersed in the environment.

As you drive further into town, it is not uncommon to see people from all over the world, from all walks of life, enjoying the waves, feeling the breeze, walking on the beach. It is a magical combination that brings us all together.

In this home I have found what is special to me.

This project really came together because I met a lot of wonderful people along the way.

I had known Ally about 6 months when I had the opportunity to collaborate with her on this home. She and her husband, Nick, a real estate developer, are from California, but they are now living in Kuta, Bali, building a home for them to enjoy with their sons. They had just moved to Bali, and were looking for a home for their family.

When I met her for the first time, I felt so lucky and was struck with how lucky I was to be able to do a project like this. We sat together at a table at a friend’s house, and we clicked immediately. I know, that’s how all connections are made, they click, but this really felt like more than just a client-contractor relationship, and I was right, it became a lot more than that. The relationship lasted many years; we became close friends, and my life is richer because of her. We are both from Texas, and we live on the same coast, but in our own world, and we had many commonalities.

Once again, we really were able to connect and share our perspective of life, and I am sure we continue to do so. I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to work with someone that you feel so close to, and who you actually like hanging out with.

There was a time, about 4 years ago, that my family asked me why I was in Bali so often, and for so long – and why I had not built a home of my own. My answer to them was that I was too busy to build my home, so my answer for them was that I had built them a home. My family, and close friends and family, really understand the importance of being present in the moment, living a meaningful life, and really giving back to those who need it most.

My family also wanted to know if we would be able to live here full time. We were working full-time, but I was able to create enough space for me to work in my home as well. I built a great room in a corner of the villa, and I made sure it had the following: a desk, a couch, my drafting table, and in the corner of this room, my drafting chair. I designed an area in which I could work on my laptop, or sketch out my vision for what my next home would be like.

This is really the most special place I have lived in on Bali. You know you have really created your home, when you are able to walk into it with your hands on your heart, with great love and appreciation. When you walk into this home it is so hard to believe you are in Kuta – because everything about it feels so special and magical. I am so blessed.

In a way, this home was like creating my own fantasy and coming back to share it with everyone who has helped to make it a reality. We have the best neighbors here. It is as if we all have our own family now, and we care about one another in a special way, because we are neighbors. It is wonderful to be part of a community. I feel blessed.

I look forward to sharing many more of my dreams for my future home with you.

The main color is a beautiful, sunny yellow – the color is called ‘banana rice’. I found these doors in Ubud, and I think they are absolutely perfect. We are using a dark wood throughout, for consistency, as the light-colored doors are in my dining area, which extends the feel of the main living space throughout the home. The doors are made with bamboo that you have to use a special bamboo glue to install, so the glue had to be purchased at an art store in Los Angeles. The cost for these doors was about $25 US.

The doors are very heavy, so we had to reinforce the frame with these heavy duty brackets, and add some extra cross pieces to keep them standing up straight. This was a real feat, and we used concrete cement and a rubber mallet to stabilize the doors. Now they are permanently hanging on the wall, and they look great.

The door at the bottom of the stairs leads to the guest room, which is where our office will be, and I found this little stool in Bali. I love it! It is a beautiful little stool, with a very simple design, but it has quite a statement in this white space. I am just so grateful to have found it. I love it!

The dining area is next to the kitchen, and this is one of my favorite areas in the home. In the center of the room I created this ‘island’. I love this area. I designed the space and bought the furniture in the United States. We are keeping this room very simple, and white, with bright accessories, so that the view out the windows really gets noticed. I have a glass door in the corner that connects to the kitchen, and it has a great view of the backyard, which is a lovely green space with a huge shade tree, with many hanging plants. The view opens up, and we can sit and enjoy nature, even though we are so close to the beach.

Over the years, I have collected an assortment of books. I have read them so many times I don’t remember what they are about, but I keep them because I think they are beautiful. This is a collection</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:45
