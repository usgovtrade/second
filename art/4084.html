Flip chip interconnect technology generally is the preferred technology to connect the chips to a substrate. In flip chip interconnect technology, a substrate has solder bumps that are connected to contacts on the active side of a chip. The solder bumps on the substrate are aligned with contacts on the active side of the chip, and then all components are subject to a thermal cycle wherein the solder is reflowed. The reflowed solder provides a mechanical bond between the contacts and the solder bumps on the substrate. A non-conductive epoxy underfill is deposited in the gap between the chip and the substrate. The substrate is then separated from the chip and an elastomer is placed over the chip and substrate to provide protection from damage that may occur in subsequent assembly steps. The elastomer is referred to as an underfill due to its function of underfilling a gap between the chip and substrate.
Current flip chip interconnect technology relies on a solder bump to provide a connection between a flip chip and a substrate. The solder bump is used to create a connection between the flip chip and the substrate to increase power capacity and signal speed of the chip. However, as power requirements and signal speeds continue to increase, the current technology does not provide sufficient interconnection performance to handle the increased demands.
Further, underfill protection is required on the backside of a flip chip. Currently the underfill is applied to the flip chip where the solder bumps are located. The underfill acts as a protective layer between the chip and the substrate to prevent damage to either the underfill or solder bumps. Therefore, the underfill is applied to one side of a flip chip, for example, the active side of a flip chip where the solder bumps are located, and not to the backside of the flip chip. Thus, a second substrate must be used to attach the flip chip to the board in order for the underfill to contact the backside of the flip chip. If an underfill is not used, then other means of protecting the solder bumps and backside of the flip chip is required. However, the use of an underfill causes the system to be more complex and increases the cost of the assembly.
For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a flip chip interconnect technology that may be used to create a connection between a flip chip and a substrate that will increase performance of the flip chip. Further, there is a need for a flip chip interconnect technology that allows for a solder bump to be placed on the backside of the flip chip. Also, there is a need for a flip chip interconnect technology that allows for the creation of an underfill in the gap between the chip and substrate, wherein the underfill contacts both the solder bumps on the flip chip and the substrate. Further, there is a need for a flip chip interconnect technology that provides a method of using underfill on the backside of a flip chip. Also, there is a need for a flip chip interconnect technology that allows for an underfill to be applied to both sides of the flip chip. Further, there is a need for a flip chip interconnect technology that applies underfill material to the side of the flip chip opposite the solder bumps.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:32:54
