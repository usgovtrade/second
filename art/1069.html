When taking off or landing, the flight crew member provides the primary direction and guidance of the aircraft from the cockpit. Therefore, the flight crew member will remain in the cockpit during mid-fight refueling. A safety briefing will be given to the flight crew by the refueling team, which will familiarize the flight crew with the proper procedures and operation of the equipment.

The Air Transport Association of America has worked closely with the FAA to develop this policy on refueling at night. This policy is intended to provide guidance for night operations of jet-powered aircraft in civil aviation.

Aeromedical Standards - Flightcrew members who are qualified to fly during night operations, and that have flown while using night vision goggles, must adhere to all applicable Federal Aviation Regulations and must follow the procedures outlined in the Flightcrewmember's Guide to Use of Night Vision Goggle Systems.

Refueling Checklist - Refueling in-flight allows the aircraft to extend its mission and its flight range. However, it also introduces a risk of creating a potentially hazardous situation. The flight crew should be aware of the refueling equipment and the associated safety procedures prior to flying, but not with a checklist to check. The refueling checklist should be completed by the flight crew before moving into the refueling position, and once again prior to move-away from the refueling position.

Before Refueling - Before entering the refueling position, the flight crew member must first complete all flight instrument checklist and fuel safety checklist tasks to verify that the airplane is ready for an actual start of the refueling. This verification should be conducted in accordance with the pilot's operating handbook (POH). The checklist may not be completed in a rigid manner, and the decision to initiate refueling should not be based on a checklist point. The checklist procedure should always be initiated as a safety precaution, not for completing checklist points. While performing the safety checklist, the flight crew member will use both the fuel selector valve (FSV) and the fuel probe (FPS) to check for obstructions. The FSV should be moved from the off position to the fill position. If a fuel filter has to be removed during the refueling process, the filter removal should be conducted prior to moving the FSV into the fill position. After checking for obstructions and confirming the readiness of the fuel system, the flight crew member should then move the FSV into the off position.

All cockpit doors must remain open during night refueling, and the flight crew member should remain seated in the pilot's seat. All flight controls should be in the neutral position, and the safety belt should be buckled in the normal forward position. It is very important to keep the aircraft at a safe distance from any obstructions that may be on the ramp. The flight crew member will have to check for obstructions that may be present in the path of the aircraft as it backs into the refueling position.

During Refueling - Once the FSV is in the fill position and the pilot's canopy is in the closed position, the flight crew member must then ensure that the fuel has been removed from the aircraft by watching the Fuel Inlet Level and the Fuel Temperature display.

Once these displays show that the fuel level is down and the temperature is no more than 50 F, the fuel level at the inlet will be displayed on the Fuel Temperature display. After verifying that the fuel is completely removed from the tank, the fuel flow lever on the FSV should be moved to the off position to prepare for aircraft movement.

As the aircraft moves into the refueling position, the flight crew member must again confirm the readiness of the fuel system by using the fuel selector valve to make sure that it is in the off position. If the fuel selector valve is in the off position, the fuel switch should be checked to ensure it is in the off position. To ensure that the safety mechanism is not engaged, the fuel switch should be moved to the off position to test it. Once the fuel switch is confirmed to be in the off position, the fuel flow lever should be moved into the fill position to initiate refueling.

As soon as the FSV is moved into the fill position, the fuel flow lever should be moved to the off position again to ensure that no fuel is in the flow line. The flight crew member must then test the fuel level by checking the fuel flow meter, and if fuel is still in the aircraft, the fuel level should be evacuated. If fuel is present in the aircraft, it will show on the fuel level meter and it will remain on the screen for several minutes. The flight crew member should then check for any obstructions that may have moved into the flight path. The flight crew member will have to move the FSV to the off position in order to prevent fuel from running into the aircraft.

As the flight crew member moves the FSV from the fill position back to the off position, the fuel flow meter should be checked for obstructions. If the fuel level remains high, the flight crew member should continue to move the FSV to the off position until it reaches the full off position. The FSV should not be moved from the full off position until the refueling process is completed. If the fuel level remains high, the fuel should be evacuated. After the refueling operation, the flight crew member should move the FSV into the off position and move the fuel flow lever to the fill position again. Once the FSV is in the off position and the flight crew member confirms that the fuel flow meter indicates that there is no fuel remaining in the tank, refueling is complete.

Refueling Completion Inspection - The flight crew member should check the fuel level and inspect the FSV to ensure that the fuel is completely drained. If fuel remains in the aircraft, there may be a leak in the filler neck. The flight crew member should remove the fuel cap from the nozzle and turn the nozzle to release any fuel that may be present in the aircraft. If no fuel is present, the nose landing gear of the aircraft should be lifted to drain any fuel.

The flight crew member should verify that no fuel is present in the tank by filling the fuel probe. Once the fuel probe is drained, the safety check must be verified. If no fuel is present, the FSV should be moved into the off position. Once the FSV is in the off position, the flight crew member should perform the required inspection to ensure that all debris is removed from the nozzle, and the fuel cap is in good condition. If debris is present in the nozzle, it should be removed. The fuel filter should be removed if it is an integral part of the nozzle. The filter should be placed into a leakproof container and the cap replaced.

Refueling Flightcrew Member Inspection - The flight crew member must complete the refueling checklist to determine whether or not any repairs are required. After completing the checklist and ensuring that no repair is necessary, the flight crew member must review the equipment for any missing items. After reviewing the equipment and ensuring the equipment is in working order, the flight crew member should inspect the fuel tank to ensure it is clear of any obstructions. All the fuel in the tank should be drained and the tank should be wiped to prevent any fuel dripping.

No person may handle or store fuel unless he/she has been properly trained to do so. If fuel is removed, it must be transferred to a proper container. The safety check should be reviewed prior to fuel transfer, and if a fuel leak is present, the fuel should be spilled on an absorbent or graveled surface to prevent contamination of the environment.

Ground Crew Members - Those aircraft that have been released from the ground crew in between mission legs should be inspected for obstructions. If no obstructions are present, the next aircraft in the queue should be released. If there is an obstruction, the ground crew member should inform the flight crew that the aircraft cannot be released until it is removed. The obstruction should be eliminated as soon as possible and the ground crew member should monitor the condition of the aircraft until it is released.

Aircraft must be refueled only by the flight crew member that will be performing the mid-fight refueling operation.

If another refueling aircraft is present, and the flight crew member operating the other aircraft does not wish to refuel the aircraft, the aircraft may be refueled by the ground crew member that will be assisting the aircraft's takeoff/initial climb crew member.

Flight Crew Operations

Refueling Operations - Operational information, including the flight crew member's operating limitations, the flight plan, and the current air traffic control routing, will be provided to the flight crew by air traffic control.

During mid-flight refueling operations, the flight crew member must have sufficient time to perform the refueling, which includes the fueling time, the safety inspection, and the time necessary to remove the obstruction. If the flight crew member does not have sufficient time to complete the refueling, he/she must abort the operation. If the refueling cannot be completed, the aircraft must be repositioned away from the refueling position before being released, or the aircraft must be flown to an alternative landing site.
