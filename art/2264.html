But the main point of this mission is that this isn’t something that we’re going to come back with and give to you. And this is not a one-time thing. We’re not sending a spacecraft up there and then sending it back. We’re constantly going to be listening with a lot of different telescopes that we’ve built. And that is why we want to do this mission. And one of the ways that we’re going to do that is by sending a spacecraft called NEOCAM to a comet named Wild 2.

So it’s cometary matter in the form of these small grains of dust, and these spacecraft are able to fly in and sample those cometary particles and measure them in our lab in Houston. So we can then see what’s going on inside the comet with our new instruments. These instruments that we’re going to be talking about. But that is what the mission is going to be. It is flying to a comet. It’s going to be there. It’s going to fly in. It’s going to look at this dust, and it’s going to listen to how it gets excited by the light that it’s getting from the sun. So that’s how we’re going to be doing this, and that’s the way we’re going to learn all of this about comets.

So that’s the mission. And then on the technology side of things, some of the things that are new to comets are some new instruments for sampling, and we’ve built a couple of brand new telescopes. But what I would like to do is get into the technology that we’re building to do these two things. So the first thing we’re going to do is we’re going to build instruments that fly in, and we’re going to try and determine if these particles of dust are just randomly moving around the comet, or if they have some order to them. And that’s one of the first things we’re going to learn. So first of all, how random is it? How randomly do they move? Or if they have some order to them, what kind of order is it?

And so that’s one of the things that we’re going to look at with our instrument. The next thing is how do they break up when they get close to the sun? So we know, of course, that the sun’s going to break up these particles of dust and that they will become these particles called electrons, which are moving around, and the light that’s coming from these particles and electrons is very different from the light that’s coming from the star or the sun, which has all these particles in it. So we know that the particles, or the electrons, are going to leave dust that is left behind by the comet. That’s one of the reasons we’re going to fly our instrument to look at this stuff.

The reason we want to look at the electrons is that they will tell us what the chemical composition is of this comet. So I hope that this isn’t too technical for you guys, but the fact that electrons are charged and therefore they can leave these particles, and when these particles come into Earth’s atmosphere, they’re charged. And when you get very close to an electron, the electrons start to interact.

And when an electron comes in very close, there’s something called something called a Coulomb field that is created. So the electrons that are in these particles in the dust start to interact, and we call that when two or more electrons interact and then go back to their original state, and that can create this light that’s different. So when we see those different types of light, we know that something is happening in the comet. And the different color that they produce is different from how the sun’s light works. So those are the kinds of things that we want to look at.

And then we are going to measure that dust, the dust left over from when this electron got around, how did the dust move, and what direction did it move? And how does it interact with the comet? We don’t know a lot about this right now. And so, what we’re going to do is, we’re going to tell you what we want to learn. This is why we want to come here, it’s because we want to learn about our Sun, our comets, these tiny bits of dust that were created from all that, what is this stuff like? What do they have in common?

And so when we come here and we can fly in, and we can have one of our instruments land on a comet, that will tell us if we’re really going to learn about these tiny particles of dust. And we will learn about the Sun by finding out what the dust from our sun is like. What it’s made out of. Why is it made the way it is. What the Sun is made of, and what happens to it. So this is a real opportunity to learn about the Sun, and this will really help us learn how to protect the Sun and how to protect the Earth. So we think that this is a very good thing.

So the big question, I’ll come back to why we have all this stuff in our little box here, but this is what we’re going to learn. And the other thing that we’re doing with the instruments that we’re going to fly in is we’re also going to fly in one of these telescopes and we’re going to use it to see how they change when they get close to the sun. So the reason that this is important is because a comet that we’re going to come up with is in an orbit that comes close to the sun. It’s about 60 million miles away. And so when it’s that close, it’s pretty much getting close to the Sun, and it’s going to fly around. And it has to be moving, it has to be rotating. And so, we’re going to use one of the telescopes in this little box. It’s really an amazing piece of technology.

It’s called a stellar coronagraph. We’re going to use a stellar coronagraph to see how the star changes as it gets close to the Sun. So as the star gets closer and closer and closer to the sun, its shape changes. It gets smaller and smaller, its disk gets smaller, and what we do is we can look at how the disk changes in size and its shape. And the reason that’s important is because it shows us how gravity is actually working on this star, how gravity is being changed by all of this movement. So that’s what we’re going to measure.

And then finally, with all these things, we’re going to use what we’ve learned from all of this to see if we can use that information to help us understand what happens to the comet when it passes close to the Sun, and what might happen when it comes very close to Earth.

And so that’s what we’re doing. It’s important to understand the fact that this comet is quite a ways away. It’s not here right now. It’s not as big as the Earth. We’re talking about the very center of this particular comet. There are some that are up here, and there are others that are down there, and the Sun is coming out of this one, and we’re going to try and study it over time. So these are really tiny little pieces of dust and everything in this entire solar system is made out of tiny pieces of dust. And these are the kinds of things that we’re going to be learning how to study and how to learn how to protect the Earth.

So we have this mission that will be about 12 years long. We’ll have the instrument go to one comet, and we’re going to learn how to go to another comet in the future. And we’re going to learn how the comets are made. We’re going to learn the chemistry of the comets. We’re going to learn the interaction of the light that we’re going to see in space, which is going to be very different from what we see here. We’re going to learn how gravity works on the dust and the materials of the comet. And how much of that changes. And we’re going to take those measurements, and we’re going to use that data and we’re going to compare it with how much the Earth orbits the Sun. We’re going to compare it with how much it’s orbit changes when it goes around the Sun.

And so it’s an amazing thing that we’re going to do over the next 12 years. And then hopefully, we’ll keep using this kind of stuff for a lot longer than that. So that’s what we’re doing. That’s the big thing that we’re working on right now is the missions and then how we learn about comets and how we learn about the Sun, and the stuff that we’re going to use to do that, which is the technology side of things.

And then the other part of this is how do we keep these little bits of dust and the comets and the particles out of space? Because as I told you, when we have these little bits of dust in our atmosphere, our ozone gets destroyed and this is a big problem for us because we need a lot</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:13
