you don't have any dance experience
Daddy: I'm just trying to find a boyfriend!
*sigh* Oh, I never looked at it that way!
 
Girl: But... He didn't have to do the dance like that...
Daddy: "DANCE LIKE YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE!"
N-Now that I think of it...
 
You're right... 
He shouldn't do it
Yeah, that makes sense! I'm like that too!
*gasp* Is it me...?
Yeah, it's me!
You're right
It's kind of...
It's like, why is he looking at me like that?
Is it because he thinks I'm easy?
Or... is he just like... 
*looks on the floor* I guess this isn't the place.
*laughs nervously*
We should probably go somewhere more private
Maybe like a private place to talk in?
Wait, where is that?
*looks around* Oh, over there?
Yeah
Oh, come on
I'm just like taking things so... seriously, I guess?
Ah! There we go!
*excited* Is it...? I see what this is...
*sighs wistfully*
*mumbles* My dream came true!
I guess you don't know what I mean
Daddy: But then...
Girl: Did I do something wrong?
Daddy: No no no...
Girl: Are you just going to...
Daddy: I just wanted to try something new
Daddy: I think I'm tired.
I'm tired.
I think I'm tired too.
I think we should all take a rest
Maybe go upstairs?
*gasp*
*awkward pause*
What?
*awkward gasp*
*awkward laugh*
Daddy: Yeah...
Girl: I'm just going to go take a little nap.
*gasps*
Daddy: Uh... I'll be up here
Girl: Okay.
Daddy: Thank you.
*gasp*
*awkward laugh*
*awkward laugh*
*awkward laugh*
Girl: Okay...
*awkward laugh*
Okay
*awkward laugh*
I'm just going to go take a nap upstairs...
*sighs*
I'm starting to think that you're...
a little on the obsessed side
*awkward laugh*
You keep following me around...
Daddy: I just wanted to make you think that I was single...
Girl: I guess that's fine
*awkward chuckle*
Girl: ...to see what it felt like
*awkward laugh*
Daddy: ...to see what it feels like
*awkward laugh*
*awkward laugh*
*awkward laugh*
