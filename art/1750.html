There are a few things I want to look at here for the purposes of my story. I feel pretty good about the following thoughts, and can’t wait to run the same queries over for the first two weeks of October for this current quarter.

Here’s where I’m at with the numbers so far:

Benchmark: $1,895

$1,895 Month-Over-Month: $0 (no change)

$0 (no change) Months This Month: 2

2 Months Last Month: 3

3 Year-Over-Year: $2,050

$2,050 Month-Over-Month: $25 (-24%)

$25 (-24%) Months This Month: 0

0 Months Last Month: 0

0 Year-Over-Year: $6,800

$6,800 Month-Over-Month: $450 (-62%)

$450 (-62%) Months This Month: 4

4 Months Last Month: 6

6 Year-Over-Year: $2,050

I started with about six different ideas. Let’s take a quick look at those I ended up using:

I’ll explain these more in the next section, but I started off with six different queries and ended up using only three: the first, second, and third queries. My main idea for finding out who to target was to pull the first few rows for one particular column that I knew was interesting to me. For the main page I pulled the top three rows for “weight,” and these are the people I used in my calculations.

Now that’s interesting, because I didn’t really plan on a graph like this at all. Let’s see how the first two weeks of October looks:

Benchmark: $1,895

$1,895 Month-Over-Month: $0 (no change)

$0 (no change) Months This Month: 4

4 Months Last Month: 6

6 Year-Over-Year: $2,050

So in the last month I’ve seen another $30 in sales. However, the total number of pageviews is about half the average (which means I’m getting more people in each visit). So that’s probably worth it. The monthly visitors have stayed at almost the same amount. We’re still only at four months on the year. Let’s look at the new pageviews per visit.

Benchmark: $1,895

$1,895 Month-Over-Month: $0 (no change)

$0 (no change) Months This Month: 4

4 Months Last Month: 6

6 Year-Over-Year: $2,050

So we’re back up to over six thousand pageviews. We also have almost twice the daily visitors as the first two weeks of August. That should keep my income steady until I increase my price.

Moving Forward

Now I just have to keep it that way. So far in October, I’ve sold $500, and I need to keep it around that number. I need to find out why that’s happening, and then make sure that it continues, and even increase. My next step will be to keep the same daily visitors number I have right now in my best month, by adding in my own ad to drive that number up to more than six thousand, plus any extras that I get that month.

My next goal is to find my own traffic source. I could buy ads on Google and other sites to improve my number of pageviews, but that’s a bit sketchy. I’d rather have people coming directly to my site than go to ads on other sites. So let’s see what that’s like. I’ll run the monthly version of my new visitors formula using all ten months of data, and look for a pattern. Maybe I can hit six thousand pageviews at some point, or increase the number of visitors even more. Maybe the top three visitors are people I’ve never seen before. Or maybe some of them show up only once or twice a month. I’m not sure. I’ll update this post when I learn something new.

And I’ll be watching out for some of the big spikes in visitors for what they may mean for my bottom line.

Thanks again for reading!

(Note: I updated the post with data from October 19th, not January 1st, because that’s when I started tracking again.)
