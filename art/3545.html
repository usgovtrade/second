Buddhist Meditation

The essence of Buddhist meditation is to focus your attention on a single object, to clear away distracting thoughts and emotions, and to direct your thoughts toward the goal of enlightenment. This is called insight meditation or “mindfulness meditation.”

How can Buddhist meditation help you?

There are two types of Buddhist meditation — open-focus and close-focus. In open-focus meditation, which usually precedes concentration meditation, your attention is gently and systematically opened to experience whatever is present in the moment, whether a sensation, a quality of mind or an object. After some practice you can begin to notice which objects arise in your consciousness, and you can stay with them in a relaxed and balanced manner, without too much evaluation or expectation.

Many students have difficulty concentrating in meditation and feel that they are ‘failing’ or ‘stupid.’ This usually reflects their expectation that their mind must be focused in a specific way at all times. When you begin to understand that meditation is a process of development and that meditation objects arise in your consciousness, you can relax and let go of the need to hold your mind in a fixed state.

The best advice is to stop trying so hard and relax into whatever arises in the moment.

This meditation helps you develop objectivity and calmness by encouraging you to observe how your thoughts arise. Your thoughts are temporary phenomena and can be ‘blown out’ just like a candle. Developing this sense of mindfulness is essential to developing mental health and the quality of your life.

In the closing of meditation you are encouraged to direct your entire being into a state of loving kindness and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings.

The Power of Guided Meditation

Many people report that by using guided meditation you can do more with your meditation. This is particularly useful for students who have found it difficult to meditate alone or may feel overwhelmed by their thoughts.

With a guided meditation, you still get the relaxation and healing from your meditation practice, while you can learn to meditate in a way that works for you. This takes a load off your mind and allows you to relax into your meditation. You can sit comfortably and listen to a gentle sound that reminds you to relax and release any stress.

You can download meditation CDs in MP3 format and simply plug them into your computer to play or burn to CD and play at home. When you listen to them at a later time, you may find that the gentle voice of the meditation guides is still there and your relaxation will be still maintained. You will have found another way of meditating which is different from your previous experiences with meditation.

A Life of Wisdom and Healing

Meditation has been used in spiritual, religious and secular traditions for centuries for the purpose of self-exploration, spiritual development and growth.

You can benefit from learning meditation and from the practice of meditation, particularly if you do not have the time to meditate on a regular basis. This is an opportunity to find a more direct way to meet your needs and live in harmony with your highest potential.

The Power of Mantra Meditation

Mantra meditation uses a certain sound or sound vibration to evoke healing, wisdom and peace. Mantra meditation utilizes the sounds of the human voice, music and chants to transform your mind. A mantra is a sound that you repeat, over and over, in meditation. Some mantras are easy to say; others are more complex.

For example, a simple mantra may be repeated with or without meaning, as a way to relax the mind and body. However, more complex mantras often have meanings associated with them. The meaning behind your mantra may vary according to the culture and spiritual tradition from which it originates. Many traditions use mantra meditation to awaken the spiritual energy known as kundalini. Kundalini is a creative energy that is believed to live in your body, from the base of your spine to the top of your head. When you open your kundalini through mantra meditation, you can harness the power and flow of energy as it moves up the spine, through your crown chakra, between your head and heart.

In this way, kundalini meditation can help your mind concentrate on the higher aspects of yourself.

Buddhist mantra meditation is very much connected to the way you speak and express yourself. The mantras you repeat in your meditation, and the way you combine them with your own inner speech, can heal many emotional issues in you. When you are able to let go of your reactive patterns of speech, and connect with the wisdom of your heart, you will find that the results will make your life much easier.

Buddhist meditation is based on the understanding that everything is connected; it’s all one. Repeating mantras with the intention of healing a mental issue can ultimately bring about a healing in all of your relationships.

How can mantra meditation help you?

By using Buddhist mantras and by connecting with the wisdom that lies within you, you can allow yourself to become conscious of the inner wisdom that is always there. Even in the midst of emotional storms and difficult situations you will find that with the right attitude, the right mindset, you can transform yourself into the positive force of love and light that you were born to be.

Many people who are not born with naturally good mental health benefit greatly from using mantras for a more positive way to live. By finding a mantra that resonates with you, you will be able to transform your life.
