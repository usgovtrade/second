obtain large quantities of natural gas, but it is not 
convenient for residential or light commercial customers.  
The technique requires specialized heavy equipment, but 
we feel it will solve the natural gas shortage in our 
area.  The "technique" involves drilling new wells near 
existing ones.

Our natural gas provider, Columbia Energy Group, has very 
inexpensive rates for their initial supply of natural gas.  
That makes our new technique more affordable.  

We would like your permission to drill new wells on land we 
lease from the Houston Prairie Conservancy, Inc., a local 
nature conservancy that helped negotiate the leases.  The 
property is located in the northwest quadrant of Buffalo 
Bayou in the outer loop, north of Meyerland and south of 
Foster.  The new wells would be in a field that is close to 
an existing well field.  Columbia Energy proposes to drill 
one new well between each pair of existing wells in the 
existing field. 
If our request is approved, Columbia Energy would drill up 
to six new wells on our land.  Each well would provide 
between 5,000 and 15,000 cubic feet of natural gas per day 
to Houston Prairie Conservancy, Inc. and up to 100,000 
cubic feet of natural gas per day to us. 
We would sell the gas to the intrastate grid, so this gas 
would not be available for industrial uses.  

A map of the area is attached.  Columbia Energy will call you 
to discuss this project.  We plan to call you after we have 
received permission from the conservancy and have the lease 
agreements signed.

If we have your permission to drill the new wells, we would 
meet with the conservancy board of directors to get its 
permission to enter the existing field. The two lease 
agreements would call for a $5,000 annual payment to the 
conservancy. 
We propose to drill these wells at no cost to Houston 
Prairie Conservancy, Inc., and sell the gas to the intrastate
 grid. 

In addition, if you feel it is appropriate, we will provide 
our conservancy contacts with technical information about the 
potential production on your land.

If you approve, please sign one of the attached copies of 
this letter and return it to me. 
My contact information is below. 
You can also e-mail me your response at rwilliams@pandaenergy.com.
Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing 
from you soon.

Sincerely,

Richard
