terrorism and the conditions under which it flourishes.
If the authors believe that they are better positioned than
other scholars and practitioners to address the issue of terrorism,
they have failed to make their case. Instead, what they have done
is confuse the issue.
The problem with this argument is that while the US war on terror
has so far been counterproductive, there is no reason to assume that
it will not be effective in the future or to confuse this with the
efficacy of other counter-terrorism efforts. What we do know is
that more than 200 terrorist groups operate worldwide and kill some
10,000 people a year. In fact, if one were to compile statistics
on attacks against civilians by US military forces during the 1980s,
it is likely that such civilian deaths would top those caused by all
terrorist groups combined. The fact that current attempts at a US
counter-terror strategy has failed is simply a result of its lack of
focus, and not of the presence of counter-terrorism laws, which
obviously fail to address the root cause of the problem.
Similarly, while there may be a correlation between the use
of terror tactics and political repression in authoritarian regimes,
there is no necessary connection between the two. In fact, where
there is no terrorism there is also little evidence that political
repression is a major problem, as countries that may have high levels
of censorship (such as Burma and China) have little in the way of
civil strife. It is this lack of focus that has been the bane of US
foreign policy since at least the Cold War.
In fact, it is ironic that the authors of the study should criticize
the absence of legal measures to deal with terrorism. It was only
a few years ago that the US Congress attempted to deal with the issue
of terrorism by passing a number of laws mandating a number of new
security measures. Given the fact that US intelligence failures had
contributed to the 9/11 attacks, it would have been difficult to
ignore this kind of legislation.
In general, it would seem that while terrorism is a phenomenon that
will persist, efforts to deal with it need to have a broader focus.
As should be obvious, while one needs to pay attention to counter-
terrorism tactics, efforts to counter terrorism have tended to be
counter-productive, such as the US military efforts in Somalia,
Somalia, Haiti and Haiti as well as the Israeli policies towards the
Palestinians.
The recent war in Afghanistan, in which US and other western
military forces are seeking to overthrow a repressive and brutal
regime in the name of democracy, can only prove counter-productive.
As the events in Iraq have shown, as well as the more recent events
in Indonesia and Turkey, it seems that while there may be some
correlation between political repression and terrorism, there is not
a necessary connection. In fact, in many countries, as in the US,
there is a more direct correlation between political repression and
civil rights. This is true for Burma (the situation in that country
is as bad as if not worse than during the 1990s) and for many
countries in Latin America. In these countries political repression
and the conditions for terrorism do not exist in the same form as
they do in the Middle East, a region that tends to receive most of
the focus of the US foreign policy.
The authors of the study argue that democratic processes have led
to the emergence of radical groups in such as Indonesia, the Middle
East, and Central America. Here the authors are relying on the old
US right-wing approach that blames democratic processes for problems
in the countries under consideration. In fact, the most successful
movements for radical change have all occurred in countries with
democracies (the most notable of these examples are those of South
Africa and Northern Ireland).
The overall point being made here is clear enough. The US
leadership has not been successful in combating terrorism. The war
on terror has been counter-productive and in many cases counter-legal.
Since it has been so unsuccessful, the main concern should be to
try to find effective strategies for reducing terrorism that are more
in line with US values.
The way to move forward in this regard is not to attack terrorists
by any means available. If the aim of terrorism is to cause the US
leadership to lose heart and thus to retreat in an aggressive manner,
this is what will happen. The US and western anti-terror policies
have indeed made the US leadership lose heart. The recent terrorist
attack in Spain confirms this. As long as US leaders believe that the
US is winning, the US leadership is winning. The best strategy for
dealing with the issue of terrorism, which actually has some
precedence in US foreign policy, is to try to figure out how to
change the attitudes of radical groups that are committed to violence
and terror as tools of opposition to the US. Such attempts at a
strategy should be part of a concerted effort to bring down or at
least reduce violence. The success of a particular group should be
relegated to their ability to achieve that goal, not whether or not
they achieve that goal through terror.
If the US leadership does not understand the dynamics of terrorism,
and counter-terrorism efforts have been counter-productive, the only
logical conclusion is to rethink the strategies being used. If the
US wants to win against terrorism, it needs to make sure it
understands the reasons for that terrorism and has a realistic plan
of action to deal with them.
I am surprised that this piece appeared at all, as the authors'
views and conclusions clearly represent a minority position within
the US foreign policy community. What can be a more effective way of
countering terrorism than by changing the behavior of US policy-
makers?

On 1 June 2003, the South African Institute for International
Affairs (SAIIA) hosted a press briefing on its research initiative on
South Africa's external relationships.
The briefing followed the publication in December 2002 of the report
on South Africa's external relations with its neighbouring
countries (see below). The briefing, which was attended by journalists
from South Africa and elsewhere, provided an opportunity to discuss the
recommendations contained in the report, and examine their
implications for South Africa's international relations. A round-table
discussion with senior foreign policy analysts was also held.
The report was prepared under the direction of Professor Frits
Hermann, Senior Adviser in the Foreign Office. Its findings and
recommendations were drawn up by an inter-ministerial team that
included senior officials from the Foreign Office, National Defence,
the Mineral and Energy Affairs Department, the Department of Foreign
Affairs, and the Department of International Relations and Cooperation.
Annex
Report on South Africa's external relations
with its neighbouring countries
Introduction
The objective of this report is to analyse the state of South Africa's
relations with its neighbours and assess their impact on its economy
and stability. The South African government has emphasised the need
for a "development of sound relations with neighbouring states in
order to improve our regional and international influence, security
and stability, create confidence among our people and our partners,
and contribute to sustainable growth" (White Paper of the National
Party, 1991). Furthermore, the South African government maintains
that a harmonious and peaceful region benefits not only its neighbours
but the African continent as a whole (Republic of South Africa, 1998a).
In the light of such objectives, the analysis in this report is divided
into three main sections: an assessment of regional relations, an
examination of economic relations and the situation with regards to
international trade, and a focus on South Africa's own foreign policy.
Regional relations
1.1.1 The end of apartheid in South Africa has not resolved the tension
between the two sides, nor is it likely to. The 1994 elections have
not resulted in a rapprochement of relations between South Africa and
its neighbours. Indeed, despite all the progress which has been made
by South Africa towards international acceptance of its transition to
democracy, relations with its neighbours have remained tense. Since
the elections there has been</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:39
