The third release of the series comes with its sixth volume, which marks the first time the series will use one of the original "True Stories" stories as the basis for an album. The first, "The Return of Superjock", was recorded in 1981, and the second, "The Ghost of Superjock" was recorded in 2002. The recording that will become "Black Hole Sun" was performed live at Tokyo's Club Quattro by a band featuring Mr X's son Tommy Thayer as well as members of The Melvins, DRI, LÃ¤ijye Beenz and Tad Doyle. This performance was later digitally remastered and released as part of the three-CD "Taste Of Chaos (US)" release.

The song "Piggy" was remixed and became a single. The other songs were edited with slight changes from their original form, and were not released as singles. There were rumors of a special expanded edition of the album, but when word began to leak, it was announced that the release was instead going to be re-packaged and marketed as part of the "S.U.T. Pack" box set. This set contains, among others, "Black Hole Sun", in both the original and edited form.

In 2003, the album was given a second limited release with several songs replaced by different tracks of a similar sound and style, this edition coming in a slipcase containing a DVD of the complete show, while the original released simply had the live tracks listed in the back cover, along with a small photo of the original band.

**The second compilation of this series, "For Your Consideration", is a tribute to the career of the Who, and includes several songs from many different bands inspired by them.**

**The song "Behind Blue Eyes" was recorded live in New York, with Roger Daltrey joined on stage by the members of the Foo Fighters. The single was released to support a new DVD release, "Behind Blue Eyes" (2006).**

The first release to feature all-new material is, unsurprisingly, the last of the "Weird Years" series, "Raging Beauties", which mixes songs from the "Superjacket" and "True Stories" releases with a new track. It's a concept album and is, along with "Weird Years Two", one of the few "Weird Years" albums not to be based on any particular theme.

The album had a special release during the Japanese Summer Festival '05 event as a double CD, along with the song "I Can't Do It Alone".

The second single of the series is another all-new one called "Sabotage", and features a new version of "Sabotage" by The Melvins as well as a previously unreleased track by Foo Fighters. The song was chosen because it was the 20th anniversary of "Sabotage" by The Clash. The CD also includes a cover of "I Got You Babe" by the same group, recorded for the tribute album "The Songs Of The Ramones". The single release is special, in that it includes the same cover of the Ramones' song that was included in the "Weird Years Two" single release, as well as the previously unreleased track "Kill 'Em All". A video for the song was made, featuring an all-star cast of punk rock legends, including Billie Joe Armstrong, Iggy Pop and Jerry Only.

The third release of the series is "The Lost Songs" compilation album. It was originally due to be called "Rumours of Our Demise", as it features 10 songs that The Melvins had previously recorded but had never released. Some of these songs were later released in their original form on the album "Keep It A Secret" in 2004. Also included are five previously unreleased tracks, all of them songs that The Melvins had originally recorded with Nirvana, and were released in 1993 on a record called "Mini CD E.P. Weird Era Contiuum Vol. 4". "Keep It A Secret" also includes some of the songs that The Melvins had recorded with Nirvana, with their own takes on them included on the album. Two of these songs are "A.D.D." and "Downer", which feature the drummer filling in for Dave Grohl. The other song is "Spank Thru", which also features a different drummer taking his place.

In 2004, The Melvins released "Keep It A Secret", a compilation album containing 10 songs which were all written by Kurt Cobain, then recorded by The Melvins and eventually included in "Rumours of Our Demise" and then the album "Mini CD E.P. Weird Era Contiuum Vol. 4". These songs were never officially released by The Melvins, despite being known to the band for a long time. These are the 10 songs, all written by Cobain, and featuring the original recordings of the band on each song. The songs are:

The first song of the set is "Downer", which features a different drummer than the one that would later appear in the "Keep It A Secret" compilation. "Downer" and "A.D.D." are very similar in style to "Sliver", a song which was written by Kurt Cobain before his death and appeared on the "Mini CD E.P. Weird Era Contiuum Vol. 4". The last song is "Just Another Story About Skeeter Thompson", and is the only one from the "Keep It A Secret" compilation to have a real guitar solo on it, a guitar solo that lasts for around one minute, and shows Cobain taking a much more melodic approach to the song.

* * *

Following "Keep It A Secret" was "Mini CD E.P. Weird Era Contiuum Vol. 5" (2005), containing four of the songs previously released as part of "Mini CD E.P. Weird Era Contiuum Vol. 4". As well as "Downer" and "A.D.D.", the songs that were originally recorded for "Rumours of Our Demise" (without Cobain's voice) are "Opinion", "Sailor", and "Lucky". The only new song on the compilation is "Scoff", which shows The Melvins re-recording one of the Melvins' own songs, "Cadavre Exquis", and was only released on the set.

* * *

For the "Weird Years Two" release, The Melvins re-recorded and re-recorded the entire record, giving it the title "All The Time In The World". It features a completely new recording of "Skinhead Robot", an entirely new recording of "My Head Is In Fire" and a live version of "Sugar Kane". It also features a second, re-recorded version of "A.D.D.", which features Dave Grohl on vocals. The two new versions of the song are very different to the original, as the new version is more melodic, with an underlying bass riff, while the original version was more aggressive. This version features Dave Grohl on vocals, and has also been featured on the "Houdini" compilation album as well as appearing as a B-side of "Sugar Kane", the 7" single, and on a bonus CD on the single release.

The song "In A Blast" was recorded and released as part of the "In a Blaze" box set. It was originally a song by Tad Doyle and John Hurt.

The fifth release of the series is another previously unreleased song called "C.E.D." It was recorded in 2005 for a DVD release called "Astronomica". The DVD was released as a special edition release, in Japan only, and contained four songs that hadn't previously been released in any format. The song "C.E.D." was recorded in 1992, and was previously released as part of the soundtrack of the anime "Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040". It's also the first release in the series to not feature any songs written by Kurt Cobain. The cover photo is by Kishi-ken, the illustrator behind "Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040" and "Fire Tripper".

The sixth release in the series is "Effigy", which was actually recorded by the band at the same time as the version that was released on the "Effigy" single, but was omitted from the single because it wasn't considered part of the band's usual style. It was later re-recorded for the "Weird Years Two" and "All The Time In The World" albums, and features a completely different version of the song with Tad Doyle on vocals. The cover of this album is by Maki Minato, the illustrator for "Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040".

The seventh release of the series is also a re-release of the song "Cecilia", which first appeared as a B-side of "A.D.D.", then on</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:53
