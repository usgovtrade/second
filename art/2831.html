Now, I think you can count me out on the fad thing. VR is a multi-billion dollar industry today. There are over 50 developers making a living off of VR right now. The latest number that I’ve seen is 85 companies, with 85,000 employees working on VR or making VR headsets.

For me, I think it’s a fad when there are 75 or 75,000. And again, this isn’t an exhaustive list, but, you know, people that are working on VR today are doing it for a reason. And it’s not just to make cool goggles. It’s because they want to build the worlds that people are excited about and the tools and the content that people are going to love.

So, it’s not going away. It is a big market. We’re still in the early days. In fact, the market for VR has only been available for seven years.

But the thing about VR is that, you know, when we look at other major technologies, it is not like VR is going to be around forever. Look at video calling. Video calling has been around for decades. But every time you think about video calling, you think of it as this thing that has been around for so many years. And then it goes away. It gets replaced by the next technology. And it feels like it’s going away for good.

Well, I think VR will have a similar trajectory.

But the thing is, the thing that’s different about VR is that there are these amazing tools and experiences that are going to come out that, at the moment, most people haven’t even seen yet. That are going to really revolutionize how we interact with our friends and family.

We know VR is not going away. The good news is, in VR, we are making it more accessible. And it’s going to be a whole lot more powerful and fun and awesome than the thing that you can experience today. And that’s why I say VR is here to stay.

The same thing happened in our country. Look, we’re not going to see a VR goggles anytime soon. I mean, at this point, they’re still being developed. But the idea that this technology is going to be so fundamental to people’s lives is not a joke. This is going to happen.

And, in fact, it’s going to happen before we get to VR. Because, today, we can sit down in a room with a virtual reality device and we can all enjoy experiences together in that room together. But not long from now, that’s going to be augmented.

And what this means is, we can bring your VR characters to life. And people who don’t have VR, they won’t need it. We can still do this, but people who don’t have VR, they can experience them the same way that they experience a virtual world.

Well, there’s a huge number of things that people can do with augmented reality. The most obvious one is, well, it’s augmented right now. But eventually, people will be able to download AR apps and they can go out in the real world and they will see information about a city that they are visiting. They can open up maps of that city or they can actually put themselves inside of a video game and see what it’s like to be inside of a video game.

You know, I’m just trying to think back to the birth of motion pictures. For 100 years, people have been trying to figure out how do you go from a black box with film inside of it that rolls to a projector to a television. And even with just a TV, when you put a glass in front of a television, people complained that it ruined the picture.

And then, eventually, people started putting TVs in bathrooms, because they realized, this thing has to be bigger. This thing has to have this much better resolution. And then, finally, you get 4k resolution and it has great picture and resolution.

And so that’s where we’re at today. I mean, we’re at almost 20 years later. We are on our way to getting to a VR world. And there are a lot of things we don’t know yet.

So, what does it mean to work in VR? Now, you can ask the same thing about VR. I think we’ll do it together. I think most of the work that you’re talking about today with your virtual reality apps, is probably more like virtual reality than augmented reality. We’re building out worlds where people can go to visit and explore the world. And what that means is, you can build anything in these worlds. You don’t have to build stuff inside of a game or inside of some application. You can build literally anything. And you can go visit that world.

And, you know, because you’ve been inside of these worlds, you can take people out of the world, and they can experience other parts of the world and interact with other people.

So, here’s another way to think about it. How do you design for VR? Well, first you have to build out this world that people are going to be interacting with. Then, you can start thinking about how to present that world. And then, you need to think about things that people can do in that world.

Then, if you think about it this way, we need to start by making it really easy for people to build these worlds.

Right.

And that’s why this is such a big deal. We’re looking at people who have never built any sort of virtual world before. We’re looking at people who don’t have any experience building 3D models and things like that. All of these things you can do in VR. It’s just a huge challenge for people who are already thinking about ways to build worlds. It’s going to be even bigger challenge for people who are not thinking about these things. And it’s one of those challenges where I think that we have to do the same thing with VR that we did with AR.

Well, let me just say a word about the fact that there is an iPhone out there, the phone that you know so well, I mean, that’s such an incredible product and, I mean, all of our applications are built on top of that.

And we made the design decision to build our application SDKs so that anybody, no matter what kind of experience they had, they would feel like they could contribute. We were just hoping that they could build stuff that was as good as our experience.

Well, with VR, we’re building SDKs that are open, that you can have fun with. And we think we’re going to go in the same direction with VR.

We have a lot of things that people are doing already. If you’ve been in the space for a while, you know, we have tools that are for kids, you know, our products are already there. And they’re doing great. I think that there will be other products that will be built by new companies who are looking for a way to make it more fun.

Right.

But, I think we have to keep a sense of proportion, because we’re also dealing with powerful stuff. We’re dealing with stuff that’s going to get built on top of VR.

Right.

So, this is really the world that I see VR as the same way that people saw the invention of motion pictures 100 years ago. It was an amazing new technology that created so many new kinds of businesses, that created all of these opportunities.

Right.

So, at the same time, it’s not a one shot game. It’s not something that you get to the point and then you can relax. It’s a huge challenge. It’s a chance to do great things. It’s a chance to build something that can change the world for a hundred years.

And I think that if we just think about that, that’s going to drive our work, because we want to help people build these amazing worlds that they can visit when VR is ready. And it’s a great time to get in now before the devices that are required are more common.

But we have to do the same thing with VR, as we did with the iPhone, right? That we have to make sure that we work with a very broad audience. And we have to make sure that we empower people to build amazing apps that they can share with their friends and their families and their co-workers and their communities. And the tools that we use to do that will be the tools that will end up changing the world.

I actually think the thing that’s really exciting, is the fact that we have a lot of opportunity for people who are coming in for the first time. We see a lot of people doing, you know, virtual tours. But they’re doing it as a demonstration. They’re doing a nice presentation, but they’re not really doing it as a place where you can actually have fun.

Well, I think one of the biggest opportunities here is to build really nice social environments. And that’s one of the reasons that we</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:44
