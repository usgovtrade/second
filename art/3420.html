The first time you see it, it’s exciting and fun
The second time you see it, it becomes annoying
The third time you see it, you’re like ‘Get the Fuck Outta here!’

It’s the same cycle with everything.
You learn, you forget, and then you relearn.
And as you relearn, you remember more and more and you enjoy the experience more.

The trick is, the more you forget, the more you remember.
The more you forget, the more you enjoy.
The more you forget, the more you get.

The key is learning how to have a more flexible mindset!

Learning is much more fun when you enjoy the lesson!

It’s a good reminder to make sure you’re enjoying whatever you’re learning, rather than just trying to get everything right first time.

A more flexible mindset helps you enjoy learning and re-learning more.

It doesn’t guarantee success.

You have to put in the effort to study hard to learn something, but you’re already motivated to learn.

Making your study process as enjoyable as possible will hopefully make it easier to focus on, rather than get stressed.

Doing the work is necessary, but knowing how to do it without stressing out is what makes you a good student.

Knowing how to switch between two different styles of learning is a great skill!

I use a pen and notebook to organize my learnings so I don’t have to spend too much time looking for it in the future!

It’s one of my favorite way to study. I always keep a highlighter or pen by my side so I don’t lose any of my ideas that I want to learn from. When I read something, I always use my phone to write down an idea so that I can look it up later when I have more time.

In today’s tutorial, I’m going to show you two different ways that I use to take notes while I’m reading an article. The one that I learned in high school and the one that I learned when I was in college.

If you’ve always wondered what the difference is between a highlighter and a pen, watch the video below to find out!

The first thing you need to know about my style of note taking is that I use a light blue pen for things that I want to learn more about. When I learned high school, we used the color for our notes.

This one was easy to draw, because I only used the pen for those instances where I needed to add an extra note for something that I wanted to learn more about. In other words, it’s a simple way of remembering.

However, I use a light green pen whenever I want to make some new notes. This is because I was taught to use green to underline or highlight important things. I know this way sounds a little more formal, but it actually helps you study better because you remember the material better.

Just like the light blue pen is used for things you want to learn more about, I use the light green pen when I have some things that I don’t fully understand. This is because it’s easier to understand a paragraph than a single word.

If you’re trying to learn something, but you can’t figure out what’s happening, a light green pen will definitely help you remember what it is.

Just don’t think that you’ll never write a regular paragraph with a light blue pen. This color of pen is great for taking notes!

My favorite color for taking notes is purple.

It’s a good mix between the light green and light blue pens, but I like it more because it’s a lighter shade of green. If you’re a bit more relaxed about how your notes will help you remember things, you can definitely use purple when you’re studying.

For more of my color advice, please read my article ‘3 Reasons You Should Add Color To Your Studies!’ It will teach you why it helps you study better!

What’s your favorite color? I know that purple is my favorite. I don’t know how it’s gonna look, but I’m kinda excited to use it in my next video!

Remember, if you are a student of a blog called Learn To Code, then you should read a lot of articles.

There are many ways to learn that are not right or left brain ways.

Lots of them require you to be on both sides of the brain.

If you’re ready to learn more about learning, then I invite you to join the Learn To Code community by joining our Facebook Group. It’s a great community of students, teachers, and professionals all trying to do the same thing – learn!

You need to learn new things, even when you’re on your breaks.

If you’re like me, then you don’t study as much as you want to.

I’m a slow learner, and I can spend time studying all day long if I wanted to.

However, I don’t always have the motivation to do so, especially when it’s not in the morning.

Since you’re reading this post now, you’re motivated to learn something new.

Motivation helps you to achieve more than you think you can!

It’s easy to find out what you need to learn by looking at your past projects and experiences.

If you’re stuck trying to find what to study next, try remembering what made you excited to do a project in the first place.

It’s as simple as that!

It’s not just about learning, but it’s also about creating!

If you feel like doing something more creative, that’s going to be fun and easy to learn.

You’re probably aware that you need motivation for both learning and creating.

It’s not always as easy as we’re looking for it to be, though.

It’s all about working hard!

If you want to be able to do things at the moment that you want, then you need to practice everything all day long!

The more you practice, the more you can do.

If you like things on a smaller scale, then it might not be as challenging.

But if you like creating big things, that will be challenging for sure!

Knowing when to work hard will help you stay motivated.

However, you don’t have to worry about yourself and make things more difficult than they have to be!

When you’re learning, it’s always important to balance the fun with the hard work.

Just like you need to balance practice and learning, you need to balance creativity and hard work as well.

If you balance hard work with creativity, then you’re not always going to be working hard or creating new things.

A balance between hard work and creativity is what makes things interesting and fun!

If you want to study more, the first thing that you should do is make a to-do list!

For most students, making a to-do list is the most annoying part of learning, because there’s so much that you need to do!

However, there are many ways that you can make your learning more fun if you have a list of tasks. It helps you remember things that you’ve wanted to study.

There are also a few tricks that I teach my students to get started on their to-do lists.

If you’ve ever been stuck at home trying to study and be productive, then you should check out the strategies below!

One thing that you should do is look for inspiration.

If you’re not satisfied with the way that you have it planned, then you should check out what’s been done before.

Many people try to be different, but some of them are afraid to fail!

Sometimes, when you look at what other people have been able to accomplish, it makes you want to do the same thing!

The more inspiration you have, the easier it is to keep you motivated!

Even when you find inspiration, you still need to be motivated.

It’s one of the most important steps that you have to take when you’re learning anything new!

Another thing that will motivate you is giving yourself</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:12
