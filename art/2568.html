But now I'm back with the follow up album and this time it's called 'This Is Not Extortion'
And guess what? It's got 16

I've got 16, I feel like in life there's always room for another. So just in case you haven't noticed the countdown to that day is on you know what it's on I got 16

4)The Big Bad Wolf

You got a pretty face, but you can keep it cause baby I don't need it now I just got a new one in town I'm not the one I am the one I am not the one that I used to be But that doesn't mean I'm going back, I'll find a new one to replace the one you're taking

You say you want me, but you're giving me the blues
Don't turn your back on me, if you want to go, You're gonna be lonely you're gonna be blue, oh you know I can't afford a broken heart oh no that's something you'll never understand

You keep talking about all of the reasons you're my guy
I think you've found a fool that will stick with you forever
You say you love me, but you say you love a different girl
I think you're lying, that's just fine with me

You say you'll die if I leave, but if I stay I'd rather die
You call me bad names cause you think I'm out to win

6)Rags to Riches

I'm so rags to riches, and I see the future. You're never coming back You may try, but I will see that you fail I'm making it on my own, I'll be making history. Cause it's all going down in black and white. You think it's bad and I don't know what to do. But I'm so rags to riches.

And I thought I told you I was gonna be the one with the power, but you're already dead. I'm gonna take what I deserve, and you're just gonna sit and watch me grow

7)This Is For The Ladies

Well if you can't see that I'm a lady
Well I'm not the typical kind of girl to do
Well if you can't see that I'm a lady
I'm a rock and roll, rock and roll girl

Now if you don't believe that I'm a lady
You must be blind. Cause my hair is jet black.
Yeah it's jet black, and I've got purple in it. It's got enough purple in it, oh you know

I just wanna be your little sweet hearted girl, I want you to love me, treat me like a queen.
Well girl that's what I am, just a lady.

Well when I was a little girl, and I was out playing with my friends, I'd pretend that I was your queen, I'd put you on my throne, I'd treat you like the ruler, and you'd make me stay
But now my world is a whole lot different,
When I think about you, well I'm not happy
Yeah I'm not happy cause you're a joker. Yeah you're a joker,

8)This Is What Happens Now

You ask me do I love you? My heart just won't tell you no. It only beats for you. But I must deny you. Cause I don't want to be alone, and I don't want to spend all of my time.

I see myself lying on the floor. And every time it rains, I start to cry. And every time it rains, I start to cry.

9)The Queen of Memphis

And there ain't nothing you can do 'cause you've got no imagination at all
Oh yeah the Queen of Memphis is coming to make you a deal.
And it's gonna get you so far out of tune.
You can bet your life and your soul on that I'm talking true

Oh yeah my clothes are black and my band is red
There ain't nothing but red. Well just look at the red that you got on, baby I said don't fight it

You say the Queen of Memphis, is the king of confusion
Well that may be true, but I still don't understand why. Cause every time I look at you, I just smile.
I see the lady down the street standing on the corner. The guy she's with, he can be really mean. And I can still see it from my window, I can't get my mind to stop. Cause it's the Queen of Memphis, she's all right.
Oh yeah the Queen of Memphis is coming to make you a deal
Oh yeah that's what you think.

Hey there's no such thing as a gentleman, I never put no suit on my back. No ma'am, no way, I just stay on the ground. And that's the way that I'm gonna be, cause I live like a boy, well I never had no boy.

Well I never had no boy, and I know they've been around. And I talk like a boy and I look like a boy, but I can't help it, cause I'm just a guy.

Well don't tell me not to talk no more, cause I know what I'm doing. Oh well. I guess it don't matter what I say. And it don't matter what I do, cause I've never had no boy.
