                          of Students

     In early 2000, the parties entered into two agreements

relating to the “internship” of their son, Dimitri.   Each party

agreed that he would pay a portion of Dimitri’s college tuition

at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Alabama.     The

first agreement was for a three-year term and required the

father to pay $19,700 per year to the university to support
                               - 3 -

Dimitri.   The second agreement was for a four-year term and

required the father to pay $20,400 per year to the university

to support Dimitri.   Both agreements provided for the father to

pay $50 per credit hour toward Dimitri’s educational expenses in

the event that Dimitri incurred a summer session class with an

internship component (internship).   The agreements provided that

the total amount of payments for both agreements would not exceed

$35,000 for each year.

     The written agreements between the parties contained the

following term that is relevant to this opinion:

     The parties agree that Dimitri’s education will be
     provided at the University of South Alabama. However,
     due to Dimitri’s minor age and high school student
     status, the university is not obligated to provide him
     with any specific educational programs and Dimitri may
     not enroll in any specific program or courses at any
     time during his attendance. Dimitri is not to be
     enrolled as a full-time student at the University of
     Alabama. The parties agree that Dimitri will continue
     to live in the State of Alabama and attend the schools
     in Mobile, Alabama. [Emphasis added.]

     The record includes a letter dated March 24, 2001, in which

Dimitri described his enrollment in the University of South

Alabama and indicated that the program required him to reside on

the school’s campus for 5½ weeks during each summer vacation.

The record includes an internal Revenue Service Form 1099-MISC,

Miscellaneous Income, issued to Dimitri’s father and showing the

payment of $20,500 to Dimitri’s father for the 2002 school year.
                              - 4 -

The record also includes an official University of South Alabama

letter from the director of the internship program stating that

the program had been created in 2000 and that students were not

required to live on campus during the first summer session.

     Respondent issued to petitioners a notice of deficiency with

respect to their taxable year 2001, and petitioners filed a

petition with this Court in which they disputed the deficiency.

Petitioners resided in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time they filed

the petition.

     In the petition, petitioners assert that:

     Taxpayers [petitioners] have never claimed the $20,500
     payment by the University of South Alabama to [Dimitri]
     to be either income or non-taxable under IRC § 117.
     Taxpayers do not claim this payment to be child or
     alimony income.

In the petition, petitioners assert that respondent incorrectly

determined that the $20,500 paid to Dimitri’s father constituted

nontaxable child support.

     At trial, petitioners conceded that the amount of $20,500

that Dimitri’s father paid to the University of South Alabama is

taxable to petitioners for 2001.

                           Discussion

     Under section 71(a), a husband and wife may elect to file a

joint return, and their combined gross income for the taxable

year shall be computed on the basis of the taxpayer’s income

whether or not a joint return is filed.   See sec. 6013(a).
                               - 5 -

     Under section 71(c), a child support payment shall be

includible in the gross income of the recipient of the payment

in the year received to the extent that it reduces the

recipient’s Federal income tax liability for the year.   See sec.

1.71-1T(b), Q&A-2, Temporary Income Tax Regs., 49 Fed. Reg. 34455

(Aug. 31, 1984).   If the payment is properly allocable to the

taxpayer and the taxpayer establishes that no part of the

payment is properly allocable to the support of someone else,

then that part of the payment is considered received by the

taxpayer and not includible in gross income.   See id.

     The Internal Revenue Code provides that the term “alimony or

separate maintenance payment” means any payment in cash if--

           (A) such payment is received by (or on behalf of) a
           spouse under a divorce or separation instrument,

           (B) the divorce or separation instrument does not
           designate such payment as a payment which is not
           includible in gross income under this section and
           not allowable as a deduction under section 215,

           (C) in the case of an individual legally separated
           from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of
           separate maintenance, the payee spouse and the payor
           spouse are not members of the same household at the
           time such payment is made, and

           (D) there is no liability to make any such payment
           for any period after the death of the payee spouse
           and there is no liability to make any payment (in
           cash or property) as a substitute for such payments
           after the death of the payee spouse. [Sec.
           215(b).]

     In the case of a payment which is a qualified domestic

relations order, only the portion of such payment which is

properly allocable to support shall be considered as alimony or
                              - 6 -

separate maintenance payment.   See sec. 71(c)(1).   In making this

determination, the elements that must be met are set forth in

section 71(b) and include that the amount of the payment is not

likely to be modified (within the meaning of section 71(c)(2)),

the divorce or separation instrument does not designate such

payment as nonmodifiable, and the payor spouse is not the same

individual who is designated in the instrument as the payee.

     If section 71(b) is satisfied, then the first applicable

rule under section 71(c) shall apply.   See sec. 1.71-1(b),

Income Tax Regs.   The first applicable rule under section 71(c)

requires that an amount described in section 71(a) shall be

treated as received by the payee spouse in the year when it is

actually or constructively received, which ever is later.

Petitioners do not dispute that section 71(a) applies to the

payments made to Dimitri’s father.

     Payments made pursuant to a divorce decree constitute child

support.   See sec. 71(c).   Petitioners do not dispute that the

payments made pursuant to the 2001 divorce decree constituted

child support.   Under section 1.71-1T(b), Q&A-2, Temporary

Income Tax Regs., supra, if the payments are made to a person who

is not the individual who has custody of the child and the

payments are made pursuant to a divorce decree, the payments are

considered to be child support regardless of whether the

payments are treated as alimony, spousal maintenance, or child

support.   See id.   This is true even if the decree refers to the
                                 - 7 -

payments as alimony, as opposed to child support.     See Eppes v.

Eppes, 246 S.E.2d 841 (Ga. Ct. App. 1978).

     For purposes of the application of section 71, the term

“custody” means the legal right to maintain a parental

relationship to the child and shall include legal custody,

physical custody, and guardianship of the child.       See id.

However, for purposes of section 71, custody does not include

caretaking, supervision, or other temporary relief.       See id.

     In the present case, Dimitri was under the age of 18 at the

time of the parties’ divorce in 2001.       See sec. 1.71-1T(b),

Q&A-11, Temporary Income Tax Regs., 49 Fed. Reg. 34455 (Aug. 31,

1984).     Because of his age, he was not subject to any court

orders as to the physical custody or the legal custody of

himself, either in 2001 or at any time thereafter, and such

orders were not entered by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations

Court of Mobile County, Alabama.     Moreover, pursuant to the 2001

divorce decree, petitioners retained physical custody of</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:30
