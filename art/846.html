identify such groups and as we've completed our analysis in one example, 
I'd like to share it with you.
The problem:  The task is to identify a group of employees 
with similar interests from a list of 20,000 employees.  The goal is to build 
a program in which the user will enter a group name, and the program will 
return a ranked list of the employees.
First we created a list of tags that might define the 
interests of the employees (as shown below)

By comparing this list to the employee names we may infer that the interest 
tags "Baseball", "Boating", "Fishing", and "Football" may not be popular 
among the employees we are studying.  Perhaps they are an accurate list of 
the employees' interests, but for the sake of our example, let's assume 
that there are groups of employees who share interests.  
If there were groups of employees who share interests, we can use the 
pattern matching technique we reviewed in the previous article (Pattern 
Matching) to create an initial list of potential "Interest-based Groups". 
This involves using a "contains" and/or "not contains" condition (or 
"prefix" and/or "not prefix"  in a typical database system) in our query.
Query: 
select distinct a.name
from htable a
where a.name not like '%Baseball%' 
  and a.name not like '%Boating%'
  and a.name not like '%Fishing%'
  and a.name not like '%Football%'

This approach takes a lot of time. Because we were not aware of the more 
powerful string matching abilities of  DBMSs and we were not able to leverage 
this valuable feature. We also made the same mistake as the SQL programmers 
did. 
Because we had a list of interests and the list of employee names, we 
realized that there was a lot of similarities between the employee names. 
In our original (naive) approach, we assumed that the names would be 
unique; in this case they would be unique to the employees. We took advantage 
of the assumption and we concluded that we could have a common pattern 
(string) between the list of employee names and the list of interest tags, 
and use that to extract groups of similar interests. If we use this 
approach, we are going to save the processing time and will be able to get 
results much more quickly.

The problem:
I've already told you the purpose of this example and at this point I have to 
remind you that what we are going to do is based on a list of employee 
names and a list of interests. As mentioned above, you may ask, where do 
we get such lists?
The solution:
We have created an artificial list of employee names and of interests by 
using a random number generator. The sample of interest tags are based on 
the list of employee names. This means that these lists are artificially 
created. In the real world however, all of the information you need is 
already available, and we will show you how to construct the list of 
employee names (which we will call the "employee-of-interest-list") and the 
interest list (which we will call the "interest-list"). 

By now you should be familiar with SQL, so you know that when you create 
your database, the database will create a table called "SYNONYM" and 
that is the table we are going to use to extract groups of interests. In 
the interest-list the table will contain the name of the interest. 
In the employee-of-interest-list the table will contain the name of the 
employee. 

The query: 
select name 
from SYNONYM 
where exists 
   ( select c.name 
      from charTable c 
     where (c.name like '%Baseball%'
         or c.name like '%Boating%' 
         or c.name like '%Fishing%' 
         or c.name like '%Football%') 
      and c.name not like '%EmployeeName%') 
order by name 

This query creates the opportunity to find groups of interest based on 
an "Interest-based Group Pattern" of the name of the employees that 
indicates that they have an interest in Baseball, Boating, Fishing and 
Football.


The "Interest-based Group Pattern" in our example is EmployeeName not like 
'%EmployeeName%'. This means that if we match the employee name with the 
pattern that we defined, and then extract all of the objects we are going 
to receive a group of those employees whose names do not match that pattern 
in the employee-of-interest-list.
For each row in the employee-of-interest-list, we look at the pattern 
and try to match it with the names in the interest-list and we look at the 
resulting match as an interest-based group. The pattern is always 
determined by our interest. In our example it is (employee name) not like 
'%EmployeeName%', but this could also be something else. For example, if 
we were looking for a group of employees whose names start with "Trey" 
and end with "er". The pattern would be (employee name) like '%Treyer%' 
and the matching process will have a different result. If you are interested, 
I would like to show you how to do this as well, but we don't have time for 
that in this article.

The algorithm is the following:


* If there is a match (pattern match) between the 
employee-of-interest-list and the interest-list for a given 
pattern, we assume that there exists a group with the same pattern. 

* For each group in the interest-list, we create a group in the 
employee-of-interest-list.

* We sort the groups based on the name of the interest, and we write 
a query for each group that will bring us the information for 
all of the employees from the interest-list.

* We rank the results according to the number of records. We write a query 
for each group, and we place the employees with a higher number of records 
in the higher rank, and we place them in the higher rank.

Note that we can apply the same procedure for finding groups of interests 
on employees with names that start with "C", "F", "H" or whatever it is that 
you may have in your list. There is no limitation for the pattern we can use 
for extracting interest-based groups. The reason why we have to create a 
list of employee names (employee-of-interest-list) and an interest list 
(interest-list) is that otherwise we could use some more advanced pattern 
matching features. I will not cover these features, however, and I assume 
that they are probably already available in your database.

The procedure: 
This procedure we are going to outline below takes the interest-based list 
and the interest list, creates an employee-of-interest-list and applies 
the pattern matching technique described above to extract interest-based 
groups. The results are a ranked list of groups and we can then sort the 
groups by the name of the employee to get the employee-of-interest-list. 

The following example is the procedure we have developed for extracting 
interest-based groups.


The most important SQL procedures we will use are "select" to extract the 
results of the interest-based groups, "rank" to rank the results of the 
groups and "sort" to sort them.


Create the database and the SYNONYM table. This will give us the 
  
data set for the interest-based groups. 
We use "select" to extract interest-based groups. 
We use "count" to extract the number of rows for each group.

DECLARE empID int;

SET empID=1;

CREATE TABLE employee-of-interest-list 
( empID int NOT NULL, 
      name varchar(100) NOT NULL, 
      name_of_interest varchar(100) NOT NULL);

CREATE TABLE charTable
( charID int NOT NULL, 
     person varchar(100) NOT NULL, 
     name varchar(100) NOT NULL );

The following piece of code is part of the procedure to extract interest- 
based groups. 
 
Select the interest-based groups: 
In this section we will first find all of the employee-of-interest-list 
for each interest in the interest list.
