Frazier then took to the streets of NYC to help get out the vote for his hometown. He hosted a number of “Free Hot Cheetos and Free Snack Attack” pop-ups, where fans could come in and get a free snack and free Cheetos if they made an $1 contribution to the campaign. His campaign launched a social media campaign #TheMoreYouKnow about the positive impact he has on NYC, and that includes his relationship with local high school kids, who he talks to regularly.

“I’ve met a lot of great kids while running for president of NYC—boys and girls, young and old.”

The other candidates at the breakfast included: Assemblyman Keith Wright, state Sen. Luis Sepúlveda, Assemblyman Dan Quart, former Councilwoman Annabel Palma, activist and City Councilman Joe Lentol, and entrepreneur Spiros Zodhiates.

In his speech, Frazier noted that he has a diverse portfolio of experience that includes everything from being a police officer in the NYPD to a business owner in Manhattan.

“My vision for the job will focus on uniting our great nation to deal with our national challenges and improve America’s global standing,” he told the crowded room. “How will I do this? By investing in and encouraging job creation and small business growth in economically challenged areas, and by creating programs that allow our nation to grow together instead of apart.

“I will lead with a unique background. I am a police officer, but I am also the son of immigrants. I was born in America but also grew up in the middle-class suburbs of Northern Virginia. As mayor, I will create programs to help our youth, give adults a quality education for better jobs, make it easier for entrepreneurs to grow their businesses and keep our tax code fair to American businesses.”

Frazier told The Huffington Post he would be announcing his candidacy officially by the end of the month. Stay tuned for the latest on the campaign trail.

Hollywood Voters Get Behind Famed Chef Who's Running for Mayor of New York City

Reps from some of the most successful actors, TV hosts, chefs and directors of the entertainment industry gathered at the home of Robert De Niro to get their vote out for City Council Speaker Christine Quinn's favored candidate, Sal Albanese.

While they may have supported Quinn in her mayoral race in 2009, she's still the favored candidate of these celebrities. The event was also a fundraiser to help Democrats regain control of the city's Council and the state's Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo's budget cuts last year impacted New York City's non-profit agencies, according to the New York Times. The New York Post reported that she was also helped by a $1 million check from "Grey's Anatomy" star Ellen Pompeo. She has already amassed support from several high profile city politicians.

Quinn has a history with Albanese, who went from running her first campaign at age 27 to becoming Assembly Majority Leader.

"She was the person that I came to for advice and to help shape who I was, so it's incredibly important," said Albanese.

The list of names in attendance for the event: Robert De Niro, Al Sharpton, Jimmy Kimmel, Jane Rosenthal, Alan Alda, Christine Marinoni, Bobby Cannavale and others.

WWD broke the story that Albanese is planning a mayoral run next year.

Lisa Helferty, his primary opponent who has been endorsed by Quinn, was not present at the fundraiser.

According to The NY Times, in his speech, De Niro acknowledged that he's not what they call an "N.Y.C. politician." He then told the story of his first meeting with the now-mayor in the early 1990s and the "shock" it caused on the council.

"When you walk into my world it was like entering another world, a fantasy world that was surreal."

De Niro went on to praise Albanese for putting aside personal ambitions to do the right thing. "This community needs Sal, and when he's here the other side will never be happy."

"Who is Christine Quinn?"De Niro asked. "Who is she? I don't know who she is, and I can't imagine the kind of woman who can sit down to dinner with her. But what matters to me is that Sal loves this city. Sal works for the city. I'm not sure the other side does."

The event attracted a who's who of New York celebrities: Jimmy Kimmel, Jon Stewart, Alan Alda, Susan Sarandon, Matthew Broderick and Christine Marinoni, and several other stars, all with their name in lights, or a few in the case of Sarandon. They all mingled for the fundraiser, an invitation-only affair at De Niro's home.

When asked what he thought about his home being used as a fundraiser, Quinn, at the event, said, "It's our home. It's the first time it's been used for a fundraiser in all the years I've lived here. There was a nice sign that said it's private property, please do not film inside of it."

The fundraiser made it a good time for Albanese. He had just landed the endorsement of the powerful Police Benevolent Association, which announced his candidacy earlier this week.

In fact, he even mentioned it.

"I was at the Bronx House in the Bronx yesterday where we announced the endorsement," he said at the event. "It's a great organization, and I want to tell them how much I appreciate it. And I'm grateful to each and every one of you."

According to the Times, several times during his speech, Albanese referred to De Niro and asked for his vote, citing De Niro's support for Quinn in the 2009 race for mayor. De Niro didn't say which race he was in.

In the end, Albanese seemed more enthused at the prospect of Quinn not being able to get re-elected. He joked, "This is my first experience with a defeat, and that's a good sign," according to the NY Times.

De Niro told The New York Post that he'll be able to get back to more regular work in the next two or three months. He is a producer on the new film Hulu's "Marco Polo," with Benedict Cumberbatch.

The event was held at the Tribeca Penthouse in downtown Manhattan.

Anita Hill, one of the original stars of the movie "The Help" and others at Time's Up's event on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, says she's ready to support Christine Quinn if she decides to run for mayor of New York City next year.

Hill, who testified against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, said Tuesday that the former vice president had sexually harassed her in 1981 when she worked for him. She's now a professor at Brandeis University.

"It wasn't an easy decision for me, but I do not want to see any women victimized, which is why I do believe Christine Quinn is going to be a better mayor than Bill</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:10
