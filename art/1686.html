The film is said to depict the “true story” of American army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning. Manning was a soldier in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. He allegedly hacked into Pentagon systems and is accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of secret military and State Department files to WikiLeaks, putting the lives of American soldiers at risk, an accusation Manning denies.

The film, however, suggests that the real problem is American foreign policy.

The Hollywood Reporter said it received advance access to the film and calls it “a propaganda tool that depicts the U.S. military as a villain and the CIA as heroes.”

Manning's trial opened in military court on Tuesday at Ft. Meade, Md., two days before the film's release. On Saturday, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison, with the sentencing judge criticizing Manning's motive in leaking classified information.
