obtain the information you have requested.  It is the Mast Desk Telephone 
Exchange Report.

In most cases, the data is to be the same as that provided by the Gas Daily 
and in Barron's Composite Reports, thus our new procedure for obtaining the 
information.

Here is how it works:

The Gas Daily and Barron's Composite reports provide an historical snapshot of 
prices and volumetric information.

This is accomplished each day by asking gas traders to provide quotes for 
prices and volumes for the previous day.  As a result of these phone 
calls, we receive an electronic version of the CA for the previous day.  
Because our goal is to achieve maximum accuracy, our methodology 
involves verifying with traders the information contained in the report.

We are continuing to work on improving this process to minimize the time it 
takes to receive the required information.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
