You know a child’s book is special when the very page it’s printed on gets a Seussian makeover. The Dr. Seuss Collection is an epic collection of seven books featuring illustrations by Seuss and color palettes from other notable Seussians. What makes the collection so special is that the pages of all seven books get reimagined by artists and illustrators as you read them. The storytellers and illustrators that lend their touch to these books include some of the best children’s illustrators out there. These are truly works of art created to honor the one of a kind book series created by Dr. Seuss.

The Little Book of Colors for Beginners

Whether you know your colors or not, this book is full of vibrant illustrations of bright and bold colors you can’t help but admire. This book is by far one of the most visually appealing ways to learn the names and basics of colors. Created for babies and toddlers, this book teaches them about the importance of color in simple ways and teaches them what it takes to make a picture.

The World’s Best Book

Dr. Seuss was famous for creating simple stories with words that were uniquely fun and easy to read. This book about all the animals in the world is a classic with simple words that read as beautifully as a picture. This book is about all of the different creatures on earth, all living together and living happily. With Dr. Seuss’ easy to read vocabulary and simple text, this is a fun and interesting read for both children and adults.

The Grinch

Dr. Seuss created some classic books in his day that have maintained a strong presence in our memories. One of them, The Grinch, is all about Christmas and all the chaos it brings to people. The Grinch himself has many thoughts that can be expressed through the characters in this book. In this story, you can actually feel the frustration that The Grinch feels throughout the story and it makes this book one of the best Seuss stories around.

Bartholomew and the Oobleck

This is a story with the most unlikely creatures, Bartholomew and the Oobleck. The world was a quiet and serene place until Oobleck, a substance made out of goop, appeared on the planet. This has everyone fighting and making chaos in their own right, including Bartholomew and his best friend Patrick. This story will not only keep you busy, but you’ll find yourself asking the question “what is Oobleck?”

The Cat in the Hat

This is another one of Dr. Seuss’ best stories. His tales are known for being simple, colorful stories that anyone can understand. This book is a whimsical tale about a cat that has many different hats and uses them to solve various problems that come his way. This book is short, sweet, and easy to understand. This book is also an excellent addition to any home library.

Green Eggs and Ham

This classic story by Dr. Seuss has to be one of the most adorable children’s books ever. The story revolves around Sam-I-Am who introduces this classic book about eggs to Ham, an argumentative creature who is sure he doesn’t like eggs. Of course, in this case, Sam is right, as Ham never gets to try them. This book is incredibly easy to read, with simple, cute words and beautiful illustrations, that are as equally as fun to look at as the words they’re reading.
