The "Jumping Ship" is to a newspaper man what the ballyhoo is to the
stock gambler. His fortune rests on it. His bread and butter depends
on it. The "Jumping Ship" is not the mere cry of a new thing, or a new
man; it is the demand for fresh meat, the cry of a hungry mob. Newspaper
men, like sheep, are always following each other. They follow each
other through ballyhoo and excitement to a graveyard and a grave. They
go to a new thing like a hungry pack of wolves on the trail of a lion
or bear, and when they have killed and eaten up the lion or the bear,
they leave it in the wilderness and follow each other till they come
to the grave of the last lion or the last bear, and eat them there and
die. The "Jumping Ship," like everything else about the newspaper
business, is founded on human credulity. A newspaper man believes a
tale of new and wonderful stuff as soon as anybody does; and he finds a
crowd of newspaper men who believe it, and is encouraged and grows
bold, and cries it, and gets it before the town. A newspaper man has
got to go to that "Jumping Ship" to make his fortunes. The "Jumping
Ship" is the great graveyard, and the graveyard of all new and
wonderful things. The most wonderful thing of all kinds that can happen
to a newspaper man is the death of the paper. The whole business
depends on it. If a newspaper fails, it must be because of the failure
of the other newspapers to "Jump" it; if the "Jumping Ship" stands up
to its load, then is it a sure thing that the other newspapers will
fill their "Ships." It is like everything else in the newspaper
business. He who runs the best "Jumping Ship," whether it be the
"Morning" or the "Evening Sun," or the "World," or the "Sun," or
the "Banner," or the "Free Press," or the "Dispatch," or the "Daily
News,"--in fact, he who runs the most popular "Jumping Ship" keeps
up the most "Jumpers" and does most "Jumping." The "Morning Call" ran
nearly all the week before I joined it. When I left the "Call," and
joined the "Sun," it had grown to four mornings a week. At that time
it was a daily. It had gone from one paper to two papers and from two
papers back again to one. The "Call" and the "Morning Herald" had been
started by young men and with young men's capital. They had grown too
slow for their time, and fallen back. The "Daily News" was started
on the same plan. It had been growing very well for a few years, until
other papers of equal standing had been started, and it had grown only
a matter of time before it would fall off. The "Herald," the "Banner,"
the "Dispatch," and the "Sun," these were all started by men old in the
business, who were able to buy newspaper plants, but who, on account
of the death of the papers, were compelled to start again, with new
names, new faces, and new fortunes. With the growth of the "Morning
Sun," on that "Jumping Ship," we succeeded in taking away the "Daily
Herald" from its death bed. This brought about the death of the "Sun"
in three weeks after I had joined it. The "Daily News" got a new lease
of life. It went back, and the "Herald" went out. The "Daily News" got
a new lease of life from the death of the "Herald," and the "Sun"
began to "jump" again. The "Daily News" was a daily then, and the
"Sun" jumped the "Herald." The "Dispatch" jumped the "Sun," and was
dead in a week. The "Sun" went to the "Banner," and became a daily,
but jumped back to a weekly. The "Herald" got a new lease of life,
and jumped back to a weekly. The "Dispatch" jumped the "Herald," and
followed it down to the graveyard, where it died. The "Daily News"
began to "jump" everything in sight, and began to build for itself a
fortune, but before it got through jumping other papers and jumping
out of them, it jumped the "Herald," the "Dispatch," and the "Sun." It
"jumped" the "Courier" and the "Record." It "jumped" the "World," and
then the "Sun" jumped it again, and the "World" died. The "Daily News"
succeeded in getting a new lease of life, and jumped the "Sun." The
"Sun" died in a week, and then was given a new lease. The "Free Press"
got a new lease, and jumped the "Sun." The "Free Press" died and the
"Sun" got a new lease of life. The "Daily News" jumped the "Free Press,"
and "jumped" its death. The "Daily News" got another lease of life,
but jumped the "Sun" and the "Free Press," but died a little while
after. Then it got a lease of life again, and jumped the "Sun." The
"Free Press" "jumped" the "Sunday Record," and was lost. The "Sun"
then "jumped" the "Record," and went to the "Herald," and for awhile
kept it alive, but not for long. The "Herald" "jumped" the "Sun,"
and got itself a new lease. Then the "Sun" jumped the "Herald," and
the "Herald" "jumped" the "Dispatch," and jumped that paper out of
existence. The "Daily News" jumped the "Herald," and got a new lease.
The "Sun" jumped the "Herald," and got itself a new lease. The "Herald"
then "jumped" the "Dispatch," and jumped out of existence. The "Daily
News" then jumped the "Herald," and took a new lease, but it was not
long before it jumped out of existence. The "Dispatch" was then "jumped"
by the "Post," and was soon to die. The "Post" then jumped the "Dispatch"
and the "Sun." The "Dispatch" died, and the "Sun" jumped the "Post."
Then the "Post" jumped the "Sun." The "Sun" then jumped the "Post." The
"Post" finally jumped the "Sun," and died. It was a pretty lively time,
but it had to end in the end. The same kind of a lease of life was held
by the "Call," the "Dispatch," the "Sun," and the "Herald," with the
"World," the "Free Press," the "Herald," and the "Herald," in turn.
The "Dispatch" was the biggest, was the best kept up and was by far
the most successful of all the papers of that class, but finally it got
a weak heart, and took an untimely leave of the newspapers.

There were fourteen papers in those days--New York, New Orleans,
Louisville, Pittsburg, St. Louis, St. Paul, Buffalo, Albany,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Cedar Rapids, Iowa City and Des
Moines. Of these fourteen papers, three were dead--the "Free Press,"
the "Post" and the "Courier." The "Courier" died last; after that the
"Dispatch," the "World," and the "Sun" died, after nearly killing the
"Daily News." The "Dispatch," which had been killing everybody, got
the "death grip," and in the end was jumped by the "Sun," which had
been killing everybody but itself. The "Call," the "Banner," and the
"Herald" all had a "lease of life," and were jumping everything in
sight, but the "Herald" finally tripped up on itself and was buried
on the jumpers "Jumping Ship." That, in substance, was the work of
the Buncombe papers in the days I have been describing. These were the
men who were called Buncombe Democrats.

All these men took out patents for their papers. They all bought up
mines and other real estate. They all took out and patented their names.
They all took out and applied for all kinds of patents, or claims to
own a part of the earth, or of heaven or of what is between, in
all the States of this union. They all began to build for themselves
pensions, in the shape of claims, for Congress to give them, in case
Congress should go under--all except the "Daily News" and the "Sun,"
who had built up claims of their own, and had, long before, been
pensioned off. When I joined</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:58
