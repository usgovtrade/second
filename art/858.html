will return in the night and tear 
your soul from your body while you 
sleep. Do not question my authority. 
You and your companion must leave

But there was more she didn't tell 
him. The woman's eyes, once so full of 
confidence, had started to lose that 
certain something. Not fear, no, 
perhaps a hint of it. But it wasn't 
that. She said nothing about the 
feeling but there was a certain 
resignation that had started to 
settle in. She had given up. She 
would take her punishment for the 
few things she had broken with her 
quick mind. But whatever the 
woman's true fate was, the fact was 
she was no longer a threat. The man 
sitting in the kitchen was the 
biggest threat she had ever faced. 
She had come so close to reaching 
her destiny. To seeing it, feeling it, 
tasting it. So close...she looked 
around the deserted farm. She seemed 
to have been transported in time, 
back in time. Just her and the man. 
Two strangers. And now, so close to 
the end.

A voice came through the wood. An 
old woman. Who was it? Where was 
she? Why hadn't she said anything? 
But no, this was the last piece. The 
old woman was here. She had always 
been there. She was the past, the 
present, the future. She had been 
here since the beginning of time. She 
could see the girl and the man, she 
could see them from the future and 
the past. From one end of time to 
the other. And the girl's mind 
sputtered. "I cannot do it. I can't 
hurt him. I am sorry but I can't do 
it."

But the old woman said nothing, 
motioned to the man with a nod of her 
head and he grabbed the woman by the 
hair and slammed her head into the 
rocking cradle. Then he pressed a 
knife to her throat and said to the 
woman. "You were never supposed to 
be a problem. Your role was to get 
into his head and get him to do what 
you wanted. But I never suspected 
you. What happened? What is it that 
has changed you, made you so sorry 
for yourself and that scum? You are 
not the innocent girl I remembered. 
She loved us. But you are a 
hypocrite. You know what needs to be 
done and you know what happens to 
those who don't do it. You must obey 
me. If you don't I will let the man 
kill you. He is a good man. He wants 
you, he deserves you and I will tell 
him he is allowed to do what he wants 
with you. I cannot change what is 
going to happen. But you can be the 
one to tell him that you wanted 
nothing more than him and the child. 
There is a path to the future. If 
you take it you will be protected. 
The man will protect you. But you 
must do it of your own will."


And the girl's mind shook with 
confusion and fear. She wanted to 
cry but she was so confused. Who 
was the old woman talking about? Who 
was going to kill her? What had 
changed her from the girl who had 
walked away from this very house 
feeling so at home, to a woman who 
was unable to make her body move or 
control her heart. The woman had 
changed her. So they must be wrong. 
If it was what they said, if it was 
this man... It could not be. She was 
innocent. A girl. Not...not one of 
them.

"Oh, sweet daughter, I have long 
dreamed of you. I have seen you 
grow up so full of life and beauty. 
I have watched you leave your house 
to come here. I have told you many 
times not to walk in the wood. Do you 
remember me? I am your mother and I 
have watched you grow old and die 
while my grandchild grows up with the 
man you love. Do not let your desire 
for this man steal your happiness. 
You have everything you want. He 
holds no special place in your heart. 
No man will ever hold that place. Do 
you love him? Love him for your 
beauty and smile. For the girl that 
loves you and for what you can offer 
this child. And remember what you 
once felt for the man who had made 
you a victim. You are not the girl I 
left to suffer with him. You are not 
the poor, misguided girl who walked 
away from her mother. You are the 
strong, wise woman who was raped and 
then had to leave this place. It was 
unfair what happened to you. But you 
must choose to live in your future 
and not let that future be destroyed 
by someone else's wrong choice. You 
are not meant to be part of this 
sorrowful life. I do not know why. 
Just look around you, in the sky and 
the trees and the hills. Look around 
you and understand that what you 
see...it is not forever."

The girl turned around, stunned by 
what she had heard. Her face showing 
pain. For a moment she felt like she 
was being strangled by the voice and 
the man who held her. And then the 
man leaned down to her ear. "What do 
you want from me? You don't know 
what it is like to suffer. To have to 
choose between doing something 
horrible to yourself or to another 
and the thought that maybe the wrong 
choice would mean something worse 
than what you had. You just lived in 
your fear, your fear that if you did 
something wrong the man would never 
stop... And now you are the one with 
power. You have what I did not have. 
And it will destroy you."


She couldn't answer. She didn't know 
what to say. She was not the woman 
they thought she was. She felt the 
man take her by the arm and lead her 
outside, outside to a clearing. When 
she got to the clearing, she heard a 
whistle and saw a car approaching. 
A man wearing a blue shirt. And then 
she was inside the car with the man 
and his wife. They were talking. 
"Have you made up your mind, 
Nurse?" The old man seemed to know 
her name. She nodded. He continued, 
"This is what we wanted. We wanted 
the woman with the boy to become a 
mother. And yet, we thought the girl 
must die because if she knew the 
truth she would fight against us. 
This is the only solution. The boy 
will grow up to be a good man. The 
mother will become a mother. And the 
girl will become a happy mother. 
She will not remember this pain. It 
will be forgotten when you make her 
love the man in your way. And she 
will forget the man that made her 
this. The girl will be a happy mother 
and the child will have a beautiful 
life. That is what we wanted."

The boy felt an icy wind from 
behind him. But when he turned he 
saw the old woman. An old woman with 
long, white hair that danced in the 
wind. She was holding a large knife. 
A knife made of bone. A knife that 
could cut through anything. It had 
been used for thousands of years. 
To hunt animals. To kill people. 
That was all it had ever done. But 
in the boy's hands it was a weapon. 
A weapon the old woman's eyes could 
not see. A weapon that had become a 
part of him. He moved towards the 
old woman, his steps strong. His 
mind full of confidence. It had been 
full of confidence since he had 
walked away from the clearing to be 
with the woman in the house. He had 
taken the knife from the old woman's 
house and he had carried it with him 
all the way from Paris. His mind was 
confident because he had carried 
that knife with him ever since he had 
seen the man from the man's house </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:07
