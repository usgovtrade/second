1989, the first meeting of the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human 
Rights (AICHR) was held.  This was the occasion for the issuance of the 
AICHR's first progress report, containing recommendations designed to guide 
AICHR's agenda during its current session scheduled to begin November 7, 2000.

At today's AICHR session, a new Secretary-General for AICHR was selected by 
Thailand.  The new Secretary-General is a senior Thai Justice Department 
official who has played an active role in Thai efforts to promote and protect 
human rights.  Thailand's new 
Secretary-General was appointed during the Thai AICHR session held on July 
27-29 in Bangkok.

The July 28 session also considered the first report of AICHR's Working Group 
on Interpretation and Application of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. This is an issue which AICHR will continue to monitor. 
Working Group members consider the interpretation of the ICCPR and its 
application in light of evolving international standards as one of the most 
pressing contemporary challenges to human rights protection. 

The AICHR Working Group on Interpretation and Application is chaired by 
Professor William A. Schabas, Professor of International Law at Middlesex 
University, London. Professor Schabas has been an outspoken critic of 
international law's failure to prevent grave abuses such as crimes against 
humanity. 

AICHR will continue to monitor the situation and issue its second progress 
report in November.

As a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Special Consultative Status with 
the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations, AICHR has 
the task of promoting and protecting human rights in Southeast Asia, 
specifically focusing on Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, 
Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. In addition to the protection 
of civil and political rights, AICHR also plays an active role in promoting 
and protecting economic, social, cultural and environmental rights in the 
region. 

In further developments:

In the area of civil and political rights, AICHR is continuing to monitor 
the situation in Burma with a view to expressing a strong and clear opinion 
on human rights violations by Burma in its second report to the UN General 
Assembly, which is expected to be presented in November 2000. The working 
group on Burma is scheduled to meet in Geneva on September 26-27, 2000. 

In the area of economic, social, cultural and environmental rights, AICHR is 
continuing to address critical issues in the region. For example, AICHR has 
called on the governments of Malaysia and the Philippines to provide redress 
for the grave human rights violations in their countries, which were caused 
by the conflict between the military forces of the Government and the Moro 
Communities in the latter's struggle for independence.
