Sorry to dash your dreams, but that was just plain silly.

Laters,

Well, it makes sense that it takes a man to appreciate another man....you 
really should reconsider your life choices if you are that impressed with 
some kind of animal.

Hey, are you impressed that a man (me) wrote that?  I must be a man's man. 

Later,
Clint

That's right, but what's with the last line?  You should impress me once in 
a while with your 
great witticism...!

Well, you impress me any chance you get, so when you see a good thing you 
should say, "Hey, oh yeah!"

Hey, you do impress me once in a while with your random sayings.  And by the 
way, you were right, I was on the wrong email this morning.

Hey,

  How are you doing?  How was your weekend?  Did you go out on Friday?  Well, 
I guess I should ask if you did go out...if you did you probably went out on 
Friday night and then didn't go to bed until late Saturday morning.  Oh I 
don't know, maybe you were busy doing some home improvements (a.k.a. 
watching the Houston/San Francisco football game).

Anyway, I'm just hoping that you are rested and ready to go. Today is 
picture day, so you might want to get to the lab early today. It's in that 
darned little white building off of Bellport (the one that Ben is building) 
that looks like a gym but in a science building. You'll know which one I 
mean.

Well, I'll talk to you later, if you have time...if you don't have time...if 
you don't have time to talk to me, well, that would be your loss. I'll be 
seeing you when I see you.

Tiff
