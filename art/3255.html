It was recorded in 1972, originally released as LP only and released in 1973. The album includes a version of the well-known Shakillth Boom, recorded at the Fillmore in San Francisco on 20 January 1972. The title is taken from the Deep Purple album Machine Head (1970) - in that same album they also mention it several times:

"The music had to stand the test of time and now it has, as more and more kids discover Deep Purple and they buy them."
