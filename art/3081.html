I remember the first night I went to a professional sporting event as an adult. I sat in my seat at a New York Knicks game in the late ’90s. I don’t remember which game it was. Perhaps it was against the … Continue reading →

The 2012 PGA Championship, commonly referred to as the “Golden Bear,” is happening this weekend. This is the only golf tournament in America where fans can smoke in the stands. In general, golf tournaments aren’t that interesting because you just watch a bunch … Continue reading →
