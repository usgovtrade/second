Charles Blando, will face an internal investigation, a department spokesperson told The Huffington Post.

The footage of the encounter was shot by Ryan Saavedra, a student journalist for The New York Daily News, who said he was approached by Blando as he was recording with his cellphone while a group of activists were being searched by police at the Gowanus Festival. The activist group We Act Radio was being searched for weapons after they refused to turn off their bullhorn — which they'd been using to ask questions of Blando, who asked to see identification from a witness.

In the video, you can hear Blando telling the activists to "shut up."

Saavedra then asked Blando if he was going to be arrested for his actions, to which Blando replied, "Shut the f--- up!"

"I was trying to ask him some questions," Saavedra told The Huffington Post. "The next minute, he gets in my face and points his finger in my face. There was no question to begin with. There were no 'no questions asked.' It wasn't like I said, 'What's up?'"

Saavedra said Blando had been aggressive and loud at the start of the encounter and that he also called his friend, who'd been in the group of protesters he'd filmed earlier in the day, a "p---y."

After Saavedra started recording Blando's exchange with activists, he ran from the officers. When he turned to see why they were running, they were chasing him. When he confronted them again, they grabbed him by the hoodie. Blando asked Saavedra why they were "grabbing him," and told him to "stand still."

A crowd gathered, including reporters, who recorded the encounter.

"It's a pretty sad day for the NYPD," Saavedra said, adding that Blando could be seen on the video telling him, "I'm not in the mood for your s--- today."

According to the New York Post, Saavedra will not face any charges for recording his exchange with Blando because "it was recorded from a public space."

Saavedra told the Post that Blando told him, "We see you filming." The sergeant also said he had been working at the demonstration as a "demonstration sergeant" — a supervisor who attends to a crowd.

"Blando stated that he was working and when asked by Sgt. Moynihan if he wanted to be removed from the area he refused and stated, 'This is my job.'" The spokesman for the NYPD said.

Blando has been placed on modified duty while the investigation into the incident is being conducted, which Saavedra said is a common practice.

"It's completely understandable that they'd want to investigate," Saavedra told HuffPost. "They have the right to do that, and what happened was he went completely off the rails."

Saavedra's video has received more than 7 million views on the Internet.

"I would've thought it would've been a little more difficult to make the top," he said. "It was funny to me."
