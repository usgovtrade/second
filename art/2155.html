"Excuse me, Officer?" "Is there a problem?" "O'Malley, you're doin' a good job." "You really are." "No problem, Dr. Grey." "I'm on it." "So, Dr. Taylor, what did you think of our friend's little clubhouse?" "I'm sorry?" "He calls it his "clubhouse."" "Oh, well, it was..." "L..." "I guess I expected something a little more, um..." "I don't know." "Like... for a hospital in the middle of an emergency room, you know, it's really..." "Well, it's pretty quiet." "So I was just walkin' around and thinkin'." "I hear you." "It's not bad, considering." "So, what are you gonna do with that, uh, mural on the ceiling?" "Oh, God, that?" "Oh, that's..." "They painted that." "I mean, that's not..." "they did that." "You know, like, a few days ago." "Wow." "Yeah, they did that." "Did you know they were gonna do that?" "No." "W..." "You know, it just sorta evolved." "So, where do you go to school?" "So where do you go to school?" "You never told me that." "Sure I did." "Oh." "Where did you go to school?" "Um, I went to Harvard, Northwestern, Stanford, Yale..." "Oh, God, you're a brainiac." "Uh, Iowa..." "Uh, Iowa..." "No, Iowa." "Oh, um..." "Carnegie Mellon." "Carnegie Mellon." "What was your major?" "Psychology..." "Oh, Psychology." "Yeah." "No, my doctoral thesis was in psychology." "Yeah." "My focus was developing behavioral techniques to help people overcome their fears." "So, why didn't they throw you more curves, right?" "Well, because they..." "because they do throw curves, just not as many as..." "When you put the fear in the air." "What?" "Well, that's got to be really hard." "Yeah, it is." "I mean, you'd have to be just like..." "you know, to have..." "You would have to be scared to death." "So, what do you do now?" "Oh, you know, for now, I'm just workin' at the hospital." "You know, just tryin' to..." "just trying to figure out my next move." "Good, good." "Can I have your number?" "Oh, I don't know." "I don't have a phone." "I forgot." "But I'll call you." "No, you don't have to do that." "Really?" "I'm sorry." "It was really nice meeting you." "Yeah." "I'm sorry." "It was nice meeting you, too." "I'm gonna..." "I'm gonna get you some flowers." "I'm sorry." "But you don't have to do that, either." "No, it's..." "It's okay." "Really?" "Yeah." "Okay." "Do you want me to walk you inside?" "I don't..." "I don't know." "Okay." "Bye." "I'll see you soon." "Bye." "Oh, hi." "Hey." "What happened to your eye?" "Oh, it's nothing." "Well, it looks like something." "It's just a little redness." "Okay." "I thought you had a date tonight." "Oh, I did." "But it was like 8:00, and I realized I have to call you." "I just think the world's problems are solved by a nice meal and a movie." "Yeah, okay, great." "So now you got a date?" "No, not a date." "It's just..." "it's what I think should be done after a first kiss." "Oh." "Yeah." "It's, uh..." "What kind of first kiss are you talking about?" "Well, it's just that I've never actually been kissed by a guy, and I was thinking that you would be the perfect kisser to teach me how." "Oh." "I didn't get that last part." "You should practice kissing on someone else." "Okay." "How's Sunday night?" "Sunday night is good." "Sunday." "Sunday." "I think that Sunday might be a little bit crowded." "Well, how about Tuesday, uh, 2:30, then?" "I can do that." "Are you done with that sketchbook?" "Mm-hmm." "My turn now." "Okay." "And it can be on that wall." "We could..." "I got you." "I got you." "I got it." "I got it." "We don't even have to call this my clubhouse, right?" "I like that." "You just want it for yourself, don't you?" "I do." "That's all I wanted." "Oh, you're so bad!" "Good afternoon." "Well, good morning, Mrs. Sullivan." "Oh, and how are you today?" "This will be for you." "I can manage my own bag." "Well, you should probably get a sling for it." "It's gonna hurt your wrist." "Oh, really?" "So, Doctor... today?" "Um, it is Wednesday." "That's what I said, Wednesday." "No." "It's Thursday." "Thursday?" "I have an infection." "And who is this little fellow?" "This is Mark." "And what do we have here?" "A very nice young man." "Mark?" "Yeah." "Mark, say "cheese" for me, please." "All right, cheese." "She is ready to see you now." "Uh, do you have an appointment?" "No." "It's okay." "Come on." "Uh, and welcome to the Dr. Demento show." "This is Mr. David Soul." "And I'm here with Mrs. Lynn Davis, whose favorite song is currently..." ""I Feel a Song Coming On."" "Let's take a trip back in time." "It's 1959." "Miss Betty Ford is in a sanitarium, fighting alcoholism." "And who are we speaking with today?" "Wrong!" "It's 1963, and it's Janis Joplin." "And, Miss, uh... what was it?" "Just Janis." "We're on our way to Harlem." "The scene of a brutal cop slaying, which I'm sure you've all read about." "Now, Janis, you would be on the run for this, right?" "Uh-huh." "So, this is the question." "Do you turn yourself in to the police and risk being beaten to a pulp or do you go the other way, take on a little soul?" "A lot of soul, actually." "I didn't do anything wrong!" "Miss Joplin, do you mind telling the nice people where you were last Friday night?" "You know, this is fun for me, but this is the first time I've been interviewed." "This is just too much." "Uh, Miss Joplin, why don't you let me handle this?" "I'm more than just a little soul." "I'm soul!" "I'm gonna put my hand on your leg right here." "I've got some music right here, which is, um, the name of my, uh, first record." "It's called "Come on Get Up and Dance."" "And here's the B side." "It's called "You've Got to Be Beautiful."" "Uh, Miss Joplin... this cop said he was gonna bust you, and you defended yourself and killed him." "Are you proud of that?" "Uh, yeah." "Yeah." "I've got to be here." "You know, I really don't think this is what they mean by freedom of the press." "Do you?" "No." "But I don't care." "I just, um... want to hear some soul music." "Let's take a little trip back to Harlem." "Um, if I can just find my way back..." "Uh-oh, they're trying to take it away from me again." "It's all right, soul sister, we're not here to hassle you." "Um, just tell us the truth." "Why were you in Greenwich Village last Friday night?" "Why were you in Greenwich Village?" "Uh, to see the scene of the crime." "What crime?" "The cop I killed." "Ooh!" "I love cops." "All of you!" "And, um, we're not the police." "We're from, uh, a community group called... the New York..." "Woo..." "Doo..." "Woo..." "Doo..." "Community Group?" "The New York, Uh..." "Doo..." "Community Group?" "The New York Community Group, okay." "And you're all in this group?" "Yes." "Are you all white?" "Yes!" "I'm white!" "Amen." "Well, my goodness, you're so clean." "White people." "I wonder what</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:03
