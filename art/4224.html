"It's a message from the future." "If you ever want to see Future Bennett again, keep your mouth shut." "A lot has changed since you've been gone." "Really?" "Like what?" "Your brother put the mansion up for sale." "He fired staff, changed the security system." "No one's supposed to know where he is." "I know." "I can't right now." "Something came up at work." "Is this because my dad left?" "I'm sorry, kiddo." "Things are just..." "Well, you know how parents are." "Oh, so your mom's on her way over." "You can stay here as long as you want." "What's this, like, full-on dad mode?" "If you need anything, I'm on the next train." "I can help you out around the house." "I need to stay here." "I'm sorry." "Go home." "Now." "I should go." "And we shouldn't do any of this again." "You're right." "We shouldn't." "We don't have to." "Look, whatever it is, I got to figure this out by myself, okay?" "Whatever's going on, I just got to do it." "And I'll be fine." "You know, my family is not a safe place for you right now." "You don't get to just decide that." "It's not my place to decide, Lydia." "Who are you?" "I-I'm not sure what just happened." "But I'm glad I did." "Hello?" "You were right about my dad." "You know where he is?" "Yes, I believe I do." "I'm at the paper." "It's about time, so call me back." "The hell are you doing?" "Shaw?" "You're too late." "My dad's fine." "You can let him go." "Oh, so it's "Daddy's" fault now, is it?" "No, it's your fault." "The entire time, it was you." "Why do you think I kept coming back?" "Because I know you." "You were just like me." "You want everyone to like you." "You want everyone to love you, but you can't trust anyone." "And then you meet him, and you think," ""Maybe I can trust him."" "Maybe he's really the one, and so you turn yourself over to him, and then he kills you." "Your future self is the killer?" "Yes, he is." "He came back here to kill me, and he got interrupted." "Your dad had a stroke, and when he came around," "I was waiting for him with a gun." "He pulled the trigger, but it didn't kill me because I'm already dead." "You're right." "You're already dead." "It's hard to explain." "Try." "Maybe we can have coffee sometime, and you can tell me how you did it." "And that you made it all the way to 2016 and did everything I did." "And saved your dad's life." "But if you did do it, if you're some kind of a time traveler, then why did I fall out of the clock tower?" "If you really went back to warn yourself, then why did you end up in the same spot you started?" "Maybe it's fate." "Which means..." "I am a fake!" "Your dad's not a killer." "You are." "And now I have to die again." "There must be another explanation." "You must have thought of one by now." "If not, then the brain tumor that I just gave you is going to fry your brain." "You're going to lose everything, and then you're going to die." "And if I die..." "Then your dad's going to die, and I'm going to be stuck here." "And I'm never going to see him again." "I'm sorry, Peter." "So you've only got one hope now." "You got to get me that journal." "My sweetie, my baby." "We thought you were gone forever." "No, it's all good." "It's all good." "Let me see." "Yeah, I have to go back into surgery." "I just wanted to say thank you." "To both of you." "Thank you for coming to save me." "No problem." "Good luck." "You too." "What are you doing here?" "I came to see you before I went back on patrol, but they wouldn't let me in." "Oh, look, I'm so sorry about everything, but that doesn't change the way I feel." "You've been like a father to me." "You trusted me." "You were the only person that I could talk to." "You helped me find my place in the world." "I'm..." "I'm not gonna forget that." "Thank you." "And I'm proud of you." "We're a lot alike, you know?" "I think so." "Hey, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be in this mess." "So if it wasn't for you, maybe I'd be better off." "Your dad killed me!" "He pulled the trigger, but he couldn't pull it all the way." "He couldn't kill all the things he was supposed to." "You're not gonna do what he did." "You're better than him." "You don't deserve the things that he made you do." "I'm sorry about your dad." "Sorry doesn't bring back the dead." "It's not over yet, Sylar." "There's still a few minutes to download." "You can watch me change." "Change..." "And grow old." "With you." "You know?" "Until suddenly one day, I'm just a girl..." "You're gonna die, Sylar." "You're gonna die." "And you'll wither." "And you'll rot." "Like my dad?" "Yes." "Like my dad." "I made a deal with the devil with your blood." "I spent 500 years waiting to trade my soul for revenge!" "And I waited!" "What have you waited for?" "What have you waited for?" "Mommy's tummy!" "Daddy's lap!" "The comeback." "No comeback!" "I can't exist like this, trapped in amber!" "I'm fighting my way back!" "No!" "Not now, Sylar!" "Not now!" "This is the time I'm supposed to be..." "Mommy!" "Mommy, what are you doing here?" "I'm gonna take you home." "But how?" "I thought this was my home." "Mommy's tummy." "Home is any place where you're with the people you love." "Daddy's lap!" "Sylar!" "It's gonna be okay." "But I don't belong here." "You're my true self." "You're perfect." "No, I'm not." "I try so hard, but..." "I don't understand." "Why don't you love me anymore?" "I do love you, Sylar." "You're my son, Sylar." "No, he's not." "Nathan..." "I wish that could be true." "He just needs time to realize it." "He needs to know who you are and accept you." "And how do you expect him to do that?" "I was hoping you would." "And here I thought I'd lost my touch." "Get the syringe." "Get the syringe." "Got it." "Good work, Mohinder." "We're halfway there." "Come on, we're almost there." "That's gotta be us." "That's gotta be us." "That's gotta be us!" "That's gotta be us." "Cindy!" "It's really you." "Mom, you're alive!" "Yes, I am!" "I'm so happy to see you." "My love." "I have dreamed of this moment for so long." "Of holding you in my arms once again." "I'm just happy you're okay." "How did you guys get into the building?" "Did you get my postcards?" "Yeah, we're in the building." "Were you in on this all along?" "Yeah, it was my idea." "I'm sorry." "I was wrong." "All right, take 'em to the balcony." "I'll meet you there." "Okay, they're on their way." "Guys, can you keep it down?" "You're kind of scaring my daughter." "All right." "Sorry." "So happy to have you back in my life, Mom." "We've got a party going on downstairs if you guys wanna join." "Thanks, but I think I'm going to turn in early." "I'm... pretty tired." "Okay." "Night, guys." "Good night." "Mom?" "I'm glad you're okay." "Yeah, me, too." "Hey, I'm sorry that I said those mean things to you when you left." "It's okay." "I totally deserved it." "I love you, Mom." "I love you, too, sweetheart." "All right, enough mushy stuff."
