In a known image communication system for communicating images with another apparatus through a telephone line, it is not possible to perform transmission and reception of images simultaneously. The transmission and reception of images will be described in detail. In the system, a user makes a reservation for an image communication on the basis of a telephone number and a PIN (personal identification number). Thereafter, the user operates a personal computer at a time of image transmission to set image data to be transmitted to an object, e.g., a photo-stamp or an address book. In addition, the user makes a reservation for image reception by making a phone call to a destination of reception. When the image data transmission and the image reception are completed, the user performs a confirmation operation to end the image communication.
The image communication apparatus includes a display such as an LCD display or a CRT display for displaying data inputted or stored in the apparatus. In the system, an image data is transmitted to a photo-stamp. If the image data is a still image, the image data is converted into voice data for transmission to a destination of reception.
However, in a conventional image communication apparatus, in order to transfer voice data, there is a necessity of a memory for storing voice data, thereby resulting in a large size of the apparatus.
In addition, the conventional image communication apparatus has another problem that a user cannot find image data that is stored in the apparatus.
A first object of the present invention is to provide an image communication apparatus and method capable of easily communicating images with another apparatus.
