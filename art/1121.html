Best 16 weeks of my life.  I met my future wife there. That was my first experience of the army. We started dating and 6 months later we were married in 1973 and are still together after 42 years.  I was a truck driver.  Best time of my life.
My uncle used to work at Tank hill, and he tells me about it all the time, he was from Texas he said, and this is why we are moving to Texas!
My sister in law was a cook for about 6 weeks..she has never stopped talking about it..wish she had stayed..thanks for the website …bobby and amy d
I was stationed there in 1985
My fiance worked at the Tank Hill in 1992 as a chef, and then became a civilian contractor which is now defunct.I have been looking everywhere for info on him and how to get a hold of him if possible, please help.thank you shawn leahy jr. shawn@shawnjleahy.com
Thanks for the memories. A wonderful time in my life.
Good site! I was stationed at the Tank Hill C 3-1 from January 1971 to September 1972. I came from the 82nd Airborne Division, I was the “FNG” and received my Ranger tabs from my CO. I enjoyed your photos and history of the place, brought back some good memories for me.
We arrived as replacements in late Feb-early Mar of 1972, and we were on line before May 1st as part of “A” Company 1-37 Inf. We were assigned to the tank base, and were very busy with maintenance and maintenance training. I have photos from that time, including the unit’s 2-mile obstacle course and an A-10 “tank killer” demonstration for dignitaries coming up to look at the tanks. I can send those to anyone who would be interested, if you e-mail me (see page 2 of the “Contact” section of this website).
The 1-37 inf. was formed and trained in 1969-1970 from the former 12th Inf. Regt., then stationed at FOB Aachen, and they trained in Germany at that time.
I’ve sent those pictures to your website email address, btw. Thanks again!
Very good memories…Thank you for sharing!
Was stationed there in 1968 to 1969 with the 4/10th. Love reading these memories. Thanks!
my brother was there from 78 to 80 as a fireman what was it like there at that time thank you
My Dad was in Vietnam with the 14th infantry ,He was a forward Observer and I found out his Battery was attached to Tank Hill. He died in 1992 but his mind was intact and very proud of that time in his life.
Was there from 73 till 76 as a driver in the motor pool then was transferred to B co 13th Cav. 4th Bat.
Just found this site, brought back a few memories, also brought back one of the soldiers that I was in Vietnam with just before I arrived in country
My dad used to brag about this base all the time in the 1980’s. He was a truck driver there during 1980-1981, his name was Ronald Smith. He was stationed in C-3-1. I would really like to hear from someone who remembers him. I’m really interested to find out what he did there. Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks for your story and website; makes me feel like I was there but with none of the fear!
I am very proud of you and your courage to be an American Soldier. Thank you very much for your service! God bless you. – Mark Nastri
My dad, Carl Gannon, grew up in Napanee and joined the Army at 18 years old in May 1962 and trained at Tank Hill. He said all his best friends from Napanee came to Tank Hill for training, including John MacDermott (now John Mackenzie) who spent one tour in the Tank Hill motor pool, and whose family, the Mactaggarts, lived near us in Napanee for many years. If there is any way you can confirm this or provide any other information about Carl, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.
Thank you very much. My great grandfather was Walter Gannon and lived in Napanee. I am very interested in learning more about him and his time during the Korean War.
I am trying to find my friend Richard who was stationed in Europe during 1965-1966 with C-3-1 and I was hoping he would be contacted by this site to add his comments about his experiences there. Do you have contact information that can help me? I also tried to locate him through my friend’s son, Mark, as Richard went to his HS reunion some years ago and would love to get in contact with him again. Many thanks, Julie
I was a helicopter mechanic there in 70 and 71, can’t even remember my C.O.
I am trying to locate someone who may have been stationed at Tank Hill from 1964-65. I understand that he has since passed away. He was known to his family as Roy Martin. If you know of someone who fit this description, I would be interested in speaking with you or finding out more information about him. Thanks.
Thanks for the visit! All the best to you too! -John
Hello Jeff…Yes it was a great place…my favorite camp! In the year 2000, I was fortunate to have a chance to visit with a lot of the former service members of Tank Hill as we assembled a memorial wall in honor of our fallen American heroes and soldiers that fought in Vietnam. Hope all is well, take care and hope we can stay in touch….-John
Nice to hear from you! I still see a couple of guys from that old Tank Hill crew from time to time…-John
Thank you so much for posting this for me. I always wondered how my dad ended up at this base. He passed in 1989 and at the time I found out about it I was too young and too far away to go to the funeral. This site is very special to me, thanks again!
Just got a chance to look at your site again..Good memories..My time was with 1/41/75. I was with C/3-1 till my unit left Vietnam and the camp in 71..I was assigned to HHD for MATS. I remember one very cold snowy day that we all worked all day building our own ice shack at the camp as there were not enough for everyone…we used snow shovels as pitch forks and shoveled the snow into huge mounds..Great site John, thanks again…
As far as I know the memorials and pictures came from Tank Hill. I know I took some pictures of memorials for other projects and posted those on this site as well. If there is an error let me know.
Wow thanks for posting all those photos. My dad was in the 101st airborne in Germany at Nurenburg training in Dec of 66. He went to Vietnam in March of 67 and did the 15/5/4 tour.. he was there for a total of 21 months.
I was assigned to HHD from March of 71 to May of 72.
My husband had been assigned to the tank farm but after three weeks became a helicopter mechanic with C co , 1st Bn . 37th Cav . He never talked about his time at tank hill and now i find out about it thru a posting about him on this site..
I am very pleased to hear that your husband had such an outstanding career after coming back from Vietnam! -John
Tank Hill was a great place to serve as a young man. It did change over the years and you got a lot more new guys coming in.
Hey I thought I was the only one who remembered “The Big Red Ball.” It was on my list of all-time favorite USO dances….and there were PLENTY of them!
I don’t have many photos of your trip down memory lane, but I do have some pictures of the unit photo.
Thanks for your comments! Hope you enjoy the site! -John
Great Pictures,Thanks for posting them and sharing your memories,especially of such a terrible time in our history….
Thank you for putting Tank Hill on line. I will share this with my family . My father and one brother served at some point in time . My grandfather and one uncle also served in Europe during WW II
What great photos of Tank Hill! We had such an amazing time at that base in the early 80’s; when it was still up and running with 3 main supply roads. I had forgotten all about the tanks, the gunner towers, the barracks, and even the long walk to get to the mess hall!
Good to see some pictures of my old home. I was there a total of 4 years: 62-66. I was with 1-37 in C co. As 1st Sergeant,
I had 10 men in my platoon who died while I was there. I remember them all, especially 3 guys who were hit by sniper fire the night of Christmas Eve in 62. Good to see the place again…thanks for posting the pictures..Larry
Do you have any of the old HHD? My parents worked there when it was still in use in the late 60’s early 70’s.
No sorry. In those days we didn’t take pictures much… -John
I can’t thank you enough for this web site. Your pictures are</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:28
