The invention also relates to a television receiver comprising at least two display units as claimed in claim 13.
The invention also relates to a method of displaying an image on the display device. The invention also relates to a television receiver comprising a method as claimed in claim 19.
It is known to form two adjacent display units in one television receiver by placing the display devices of both display units side by side. For instance, an LCD display and an EL display are arranged one above the other.
The problem in known arrangements is that the displays cannot easily be operated simultaneously. This is the case for instance when displaying menus on the two displays.
The invention has for its object to solve this problem. To this end the first display device is designed to display image data comprising multiple display regions representing multiple images. When one image is displayed in one display region of the image data, the other display region of the image data can be used to display another image.
By placing the two display regions side by side, for instance above each other, it becomes possible to display images simultaneously on the two displays. For instance menus can be displayed simultaneously on both displays. This enables the display to be more easily controlled by the user.
According to a further aspect of the invention, a method for operating a display device is provided. In the method the display device comprises multiple display regions. The display device displays image data comprising multiple display regions. The image data comprises data for at least one displayed image and image data for at least one other displayed image. The method comprises displaying at least one of the displayed images. The other displayed image is displayed by using one of the image data.
In this way different images can be displayed on the display device simultaneously. For instance menus can be displayed simultaneously on both displays. This enables the display to be more easily controlled by the user.
A television receiver according to the invention has two display units as described above. Each display unit comprises at least one image source. In an embodiment the image source is a display device. In another embodiment the image source is a television camera. When the television receiver has two display units, at least one display device is a display device as described above. When the television receiver comprises two display units, a method as described above is used for displaying images on the display devices.
The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The description of the prior art in the aforementioned international patent application is herewith incorporated by reference.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:36
