In the case of missing persons, dental radiographic techniques may play a very important part in the identification of human remains. In the period of six months, a collection of 120 radiographs of the jawbone, taken on the occasion of pre-extraction orthopantomograms, was examined. The radiographs were divided into two groups, those with a radiographically recorded age indication, and those without this. The first group (n = 70) contained all cases, where there were at least two teeth; the second group (n = 50) included the patients where only one or no teeth were present. The results showed that even a complete dentition cannot be established with absolute certainty as an individual factor. Most often, age estimation was possible to the nearest year of life. By means of this method of radiographic dental age determination it is possible to determine age intervals in different stages of development in the individual case. In the age range under discussion, dentition is not yet fully developed, therefore in this age interval dentition can be used as individual factor. In young children, where no complete dental development is observed, it is impossible to estimate age in the individual case. This may have important forensic consequences, as it will be shown that this age range is a source of error in the group of young children. In individuals older than 7 years, i.e., where full dentition is observed, the method is well-suited for determination of age-related characteristics. This may, for instance, be the basis of certain indications of racial characteristics (e.g. European/non-European, male/female). An estimation of teeth development (permanent teeth, secondary dentition) in the area of the future incisors may also be of value in the forensic context.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:32:58
