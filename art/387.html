Instead 
of getting better we were getting
worse every day. We started doing 
more tests on her and they
turned up negative. We did 
another test that was more of 
a screening and that was 
positive. Then all this was 
picked up, so I’ve got a 
patient. My physician and I 
were very involved in her 
treatment, but I thought we 
were doing something that was 
very low risk and the 
outcome—by definition—is not 
guaranteed. I had an 80-year-old
woman in my office whose family
history was all positive. I 
said, this is something that is
very low risk for her. It 
turned out—I’ll never forget it.
There was a knock on my door 
and I said, excuse me, 
whoever’s there, and the 
person said, it’s the police. 
They gave me that kind of 
reception I didn’t expect. I 
got my license—I got into 
trouble at work because I was 
a nurse and everybody was 
asking me questions. I 
thought, this is bad. Now I 
have two patients with a 
potentially bad outcome. How 
can I do this as a healthcare 
provider and have a plan that’s 
going to be safe and 
acceptable to the patient and 
make sure this doesn’t happen 
again? So that’s what we’re 
going to talk about today. 
We’re going to cover all the 
aspects of this. We’ll start 
out with a little bit of a 
medical history. You’ll see a 
lot of similarities as to how 
I developed my plan and how we 
developed our plan. We’ll talk 
about how we came up with our 
plan to make sure that 
everything was understood. I’m 
going to describe my specific 
plan that we developed. 
Then we’re going to talk about 
the differences between the 
FDA guidelines and how that’s 
going to affect how people are 
going to see things. I’m going 
to talk a little bit about what 
we see in the guidelines. 
Finally I’m going to tell you 
about the three things that you 
need to think about when you’re 
making sure you do things safely
for patients. And I’m going to 
leave you with a very real 
example of how we’re going to 
work through the things that 
you need to think about to 
make sure you get this right. 
I’m going to start by talking 
about the medical history of 
the patient that you’re 
going to want to use for your 
plan. In the next two slides, I 
will talk about the three things
that we have to deal with when 
we are dealing with patients 
with the Covid-19 
infection. The first thing is we 
need to understand that many 
people who are infected will 
experience a mild illness, a 
mild illness. Some of them may 
experience more severe 
illnesses. And some of them may 
experience a death. The second 
thing is that we should be 
understanding that there are 
factors that may make this a 
worse outcome for a patient and 
make it more severe. And we 
have some treatment guidelines 
that are going to be a little 
bit useful when it comes to 
some of these things. We’re 
going to talk about how some of 
these risk factors will make 
things different. And then the 
third thing is that we also 
need to talk about things we can 
do to prevent this, prevent 
this from becoming 
much worse. And the most 
common of these are things that 
you can do in your home. I’m 
going to come back with a little
bit of an example of a patient 
that we treated who had a lot 
of these risk factors. If you 
go to this website you can see a
few things of what we need to 
think about when we are working 
with our patients. I’m going to 
read to you from what the 
FDA says about how to treat 
these patients. These are some 
of the things that we’re going 
to talk about. I will make sure 
that I’ll come back here in the 
middle of this presentation. 
These are some of the things 
that you can use to help when 
you’re talking to your patients
about any of these Covid-19 
outbreaks, because this is 
really all that we have. These 
guidelines are not that great 
at all. These guidelines are 
being updated on a regular basis.
There’s nothing here that says 
you’ve got to change anything. 
The point of these is that the 
guidelines are for healthcare 
providers. These guidelines are 
in many different languages and
they’re not quite clear, but 
this is the information that we 
have. Okay. I’m going to read 
to you what the FDA is saying 
about things that may make 
things a little bit worse and 
make it harder for patients to 
recover and get better. Okay, 
so the first one is that patients
who are elderly. 
The second one is that patients 
who have underlying health 
problems such as diabetes, 
obesity, cardiovascular 
disease, or lung disease. 
These are things that are 
associated with a more serious 
outcome. The third one is if the
patient has a chronic condition 
like asthma or diabetes that’s 
complicated. 
The fourth one is having 
certain kinds of conditions that
make it harder for the 
patients to breathe. That’s 
things like heart or lung 
failure. The fifth one is if 
the patient has received 
hospitalization or had to be 
treated in the ICU for any 
reason. 
The sixth one is if the 
patient is on immunosuppressive 
therapy. Immunosuppression is 
drugs that prevent the body from 
regulating its own immune 
system, and that includes drugs 
like chemotherapy and other 
treatments that have an impact 
on the immune system. It can be 
things like steroids. Any of 
these things will make patients 
feel worse when they are 
infected with this virus, and 
they will make it more difficult
for the patients to get better. 
And the last thing is that the 
patients who are infected with 
a certain kind of flu that 
causes a lot of pneumonia. 
These are the common flu. They 
are very closely related to 
what this virus is. Okay, so 
I’m going to talk about the 
patient that we had that 
presented with these risk 
factors. And that’s just going 
to help us understand what we 
need to do as healthcare 
providers. We can’t think that 
they’re the only patient we’re 
going to see. I think we need 
to be able to understand the 
population that we’re dealing 
with. We’re going to be talking
about the Covid-19 infection.
And what is our patient? I’m 
going to show you a very real 
situation and the patient we 
talked about. This is a picture 
of a 68-year-old white male.
He weighs about 160 pounds. He 
is about six feet tall. He is 
very cooperative, and I 
anticipate that you’re going to 
feel very comfortable talking 
about him because you can see 
some of the things that are 
associated with what we talked 
about earlier. He has a heart 
attack at age 50. He was treated 
for that, and he never really 
had any trouble with that. He 
never had any problems with that
for more than twenty years. He 
never has been hospitalized, 
and he never has had any 
medical treatment outside of 
cardiology. This was more than 
twenty years ago, when I 
graduated medical school and had
my first medical rotation. He’s 
never had a serious medical 
condition since he was 50 years 
old. The reason that’s important
is that we’re dealing with a lot
of the factors that can be 
associated with a serious outcome
to the infection. He has 
hypertension that we treat with 
medicine, blood pressure 
medication. We have him on
