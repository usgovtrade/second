I've Got Strength Now to Carry the Flag is the debut studio album by Northern Irish punk rock band Stiff Little Fingers, released on 18 October 1977 on Chiswick Records. The album is said to have been originally recorded in November 1975 but never released, as a 2 track demo featuring songs "Streets of London" and "Back with the Boys".

The album was originally released on the band's own Chiswick label and is now a re-release on Cherry Red Records. A single of the album's title song was released at the same time as the album. On 1 October 2008 the album was reissued in a new 2-disc Deluxe Edition on Cherry Red Records/EMI. In 2012 the album was again reissued on CD, this time on the band's own label - Sleevenotes - as part of a Box Set with a bonus DVD.
