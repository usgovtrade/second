## **In a nutshell**

Every day, people use your web site to do all sorts of things—find your address or phone number, send you an e-mail, visit your company's website, buy something from you, make a donation, or download a free pamphlet. It is a _web site_ , after all, and not a doorstop. Your web site needs to be more than an information delivery device. It needs to be something your readers or visitors _want to be_.

The site must meet an underlying goal: to serve your visitors in one way or another. If your web site is to succeed as a business tool and an information medium, it must support the goals of the organization whose activities it serves. In order for it to do that, it has to address your readers' and viewers' needs in a meaningful way.

There are no hard-and-fast rules for creating a web site. Each site is different, but if you can identify commonalities among them and take advantage of them in your site's design, you can position your web site to take advantage of the latest technology and gain a competitive edge.
