have no understanding of what is possible when it comes to software engineering
and security.

Security experts have known about the ability of this functionality for years.
And have in fact been discussing, as a vulnerability, the fact that attackers
can use the access token as part of a username to get system access that way.
This is exactly why access tokens are so weak and why we tell users that they
are. The fact that this functionality exists and that the OAuth documentation
states that it should be used as part of the password flow means that in a
fairly common auth situation, you've got a bad system.

Your example: "I'm logged in as Alice and now I want to sign up as Bob (no,
really)." The correct response from the system is that Bob is no longer logged
in. I'm guessing the reason you want to do this is because Alice hasn't been
online for a long time. That's okay, but when Alice next logs in, you'll have
to log in as Alice and then add Bob to the system. A better system is one that
not only doesn't give you a false sense of security, but one that actually
makes security easier for users.

Oh, it's not secure if you leave off the _& , which you always do. That is not
allowed! What you have done is make a token that is an email address. That is
like giving the web site your password, every time you visit the web site.

What else can it be?

    
    
      1. A single use token? You should know, because you always remove the &, so you can't use it multiple times.
      2. An access token? You can't do anything with this access token!
      3. A token? This is a token.
      4. I give up.
    

You can't do anything with any of those. This is a "single use" token.

I have seen two different login tokens represented as email addresses. The
first was an MD5 hash of a username plus a salt. The second was a base64
encoded sha256 hash of the email address.

The latter was the first one I saw, and I asked what happened when someone's
email address changed. This confused a lot of people, I recall, because they
had the impression that a password was being transformed into an email
address. I asked them to check their web mail a few times, and all of them had
the same hash for that email address for years.

The first one I saw is just as bad. People do not change their email address.
They might change their name or a number of other bits of data, but this is
almost never true for an email address.

The email address is a public information, which can be changed anytime.

So a MD5 hash is only a small change of the email address. I doubt any good
developer will use MD5 hash, which should not be used any more.

The email address is a unique identifier, which is a combination of the name,
gender, gender and so forth. If it has changed once, it can be changed again,
which cannot guarantee that the user did not change its username.

I use the same email to receive newsletters from many sites so I am thinking
of sharing the same email. I know that I'll get flagged by spam filters because
I have many spam-related issues. But I need this feature for _some_ sites that
aren't email-related (in particular Github does this for many things so I need
to subscribe for more services).

I know I can setup more email for each site, but still it doesn't work well if
I have a dozen of services that I want to use regularly (like Github,
CloudFoundry, PivotalTracker, Twitter, Foursquare, etc)

I recently setup my own email account to replace the Gmail account I use with
GMail. It was quite easy to do and the gmail app on my iPhone automatically
setup access to the same address.

this is exactly what I do, except 'firstname-lastname' is a local domain and I
don't let anyone leave if it's not a google account

A few points:

* You state that you use email addresses to identify your users, but they are not unique:
    
    
        "Users are able to change their usernames and e-mail addresses, so usernames cannot be used to uniquely identify users of a site. Usernames can only provide some approximation of user identity." <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.1>
    

* "Since usernames can change, when generating a random number, they are also included in the ID token. This allows developers to perform a “back channel authentication” by checking if the number they are sending matches the number they got back from the end user." (my emphasis) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-2.2>
    
    

From the above, it seems like the only reasonable user id scheme is a username
+ email address.

* The email address in your scheme is exposed to the end user for anyone who can intercept the email (like on an open wifi network, on a public computer). [http://www.phildev.net/email-attacks-2/](http://www.phildev.net/email-attacks-2/)
    

There's much more to it than meets the eye; this is a great summary of the
fundamental problems.

You do realize that there is no email header on an HTTP GET request, right?

pokoleo
I was referring to the email address in the "public key" (which is available on
some systems).

> There's much more to it than meets the eye

This is under the assumption that you're making a good faith effort to write a
proper application. There are better options than the current method, so your
assertion can't be true in practice.

joelthelion
You have to add some kind of challenge to distinguish a login request from a
registration request. You can't just rely on the fact that there's a valid
email.

Also, don't use email address as unique identifiers. It's almost guaranteed
that you'll have at least one duplicate.

I've seen this same kind of stuff all over the internet, and I always point
out...

(1) the "username" value is an e-mail address that's known to the server; the
password that the user enters is never sent over the wire. (2) the URL's hash
function uses only the username, not the email address, as part of the hash
code.

Are you seeing something I'm not?

How about _not_ recommending users to make a password that's not in a
dictionary ?

~~~
saraid216
The recommendation to use one that's not in a dictionary is to reduce your
risk of your password being guessed by brute force, and let's face it: that's
usually the thing that comes up in the headlines about cracked passwords.

At this point in time, there are no good alternatives to using email
addresses.

email addresses are a poor mechanism for generating random strings that are
not in the public domain.

a much better solution is to use hashes generated by a secure CS</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:56
