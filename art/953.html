I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things. We already do not have enough problems.

Chris, what would you like for breakfast?

Chris, you do not need to do your homework.  I have already done it for you

Chris, do you know the answer to that question?

Chris, do you realize that you need at least 21 handson hours to complete 
your project, and I will not give you any until it is due? 

Chris, we have talked about this many times.  No, you may not use the school 
computer
to play your Nintendo.

Chris, you do not need to bring your video game world to school. 

Chris, you need to stop thinking of strange new ways to make you look like 
a 
dumbass

Chris, you are a dork.  Stop acting like one.

Chris, your day is coming, brother.

Chris, are you going to be on the math team?

Chris, you are an idiot.

Chris, I can not believe you did that.

Chris, you are an embarrassment.

Chris, you are giving me a cancer!


Chris, this is funny.

Chris, you are one ugly motherfucker!

Chris, what is your mother doing smoking crack at 4:30 in the morning?

Chris, your mother's new boyfriend is a total dog.

Chris, we need to talk.

Chris, what are you wearing?

Chris, do you have a gun?

Chris, you need to get your fucking ass kicked.

Chris, you think it's okay to cut my hamstrings when I am not looking?

Chris, what is wrong with you?

Chris, if you pull that shit again I am going to beat the shit out of you.

Chris, it is so cold in here.

Chris, what is wrong with you?

Chris, you smell like shit.

Chris, what are you smoking?

Chris, get your shit together.

Chris, what is your freaking problem, man?

Chris, you're so dumb.

Chris, quit being such a fag.

Chris, you are so gay!

Chris, your dog is such a little bitch.

Chris, grow up!

Chris, stop being such a little kid!

Chris, do you want to make a million dollars?

Chris, are you going to be able to get out of going to this year's slumber 
party?

Chris, you are such a little boy!

Chris, I can see your willpower is weakening.

Chris, you can be such a dipshit!

Chris, what are you eating?


Chris, did you bring the Nintendo game?


Chris, my mom is so fat.


Chris, we need to order more beer and pizza.


Chris, I told you to knock it off!

Chris, you know what time it is?

Chris, you are so easy to amuse.

Chris, is your head going to cave in?

Chris, relax!

Chris, stop playing around.

Chris, shut the fuck up!

Chris, would you like some cheese with that whine?

Chris, do not be stupid.

Chris, that was so gay.


Chris, you should not be hitting the bottle.

Chris, you are a fucking idiot!

Chris, he can walk!

Chris, I hate you!

Chris, I fucking hate you!

Chris, you are so weird.

Chris, what were you thinking?

Chris, you have a fucking death wish.

Chris, do you want to die?

Chris, what are you eating?

Chris, you are such a dumb ass.

Chris, you need to get laid.


Chris, what are you taking about?


Chris, I love you.


Chris, what are you crazy?


Chris, I love you!


Chris, do you have a fucking brain tumor?

Chris, is your family retarded?

Chris, would you fuck a man?

Chris, would you fuck a dog?

Chris, he sucks!

Chris, you are not helping things out at all!

Chris, you are such a fucking idiot.

Chris, you are a fucking retard!


Chris, are you coming over?

Chris, you are a pussy!

Chris, he must not have seen you.

Chris, what are you going to do about school tomorrow?

Chris, do not be stupid.

Chris, would you fuck me?

Chris, I want to touch your tits.


Chris, are you okay?

Chris, you should be ashamed of yourself.

Chris, are you on drugs?

Chris, why do you put up with him?

Chris, you are going to have to clean my room!

Chris, you are gay!

Chris, do you have any friends?

Chris, why do you waste your time with those fucking idiots?

Chris, I just want to eat your fucking face.

Chris, that will hurt you more than it hurts me.

Chris, you are such a little bitch.

Chris, you just love being controlled, don't you?

Chris, if I had a knife I would kill you.

Chris, I hope you die.

Chris, you are fucked up.

Chris, what happened?

Chris, you are so fucking stupid.

Chris, he is so cute!

Chris, I do not want to go out tonight.

Chris, I am the best pitcher in the league.

Chris, do you want to play some ball tonight?

Chris, I would do your mom for a dollar.

Chris, I can tell when you are lying.

Chris, stop being such a fag.

Chris, stop talking shit about my brother!

Chris, what is wrong with you?

Chris, have you taken any hard drugs today?

Chris, you have had one beer, you fucking pussy!

Chris, did you fart in your pants?

Chris, I can tell when you are lying.

Chris, I am the king of the world.

Chris, if you think you are such a great catch, why don't you go jump off a 
bridge?

Chris, did you come here to kick the shit out of me?

Chris, you are just a dumb fuck.

Chris, I just want to shoot you.

Chris, you are my little fuck.
