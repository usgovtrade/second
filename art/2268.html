Can you tell me how you feel about that? Do you feel comfortable to reveal what is happening behind the scenes of making decisions and why those decisions are being made?

I’m not prepared to give any detail about that right now. But it’s not something that I feel like is sensitive, or something that should be shielded. It’s a fact of working on a live service, and there is just always going to be internal discussions, and there are always going to be different ideas and opinions, and so on. And so far, our community has really liked what we’ve been working on. We still have some more to do, but I feel like the vast majority of our users appreciate our actions.

The other thing is that as a community member, when I join a community, I can decide to join a community and I can choose whether I would like to know about what’s happening behind the scenes. So that’s not an issue for us. I have, I guess, a little bit of a better perspective on that question, because I know there’s been a lot of discussions recently, even among the larger companies, about what’s fair and what’s not.

As we talk to customers and members of our community and try to hear their feedback, do you feel like there are particular ways in which you would like to make this different from how other companies make decisions? How is your approach different from other companies?

We have been really open about why we are doing certain things. When we announced that the app was going to be moving to subscription-based, we really let everybody know why that was the direction we wanted to go in. It’s really just us wanting to invest more heavily in the product and making it better. We don’t do this because we feel like we’re above everybody else in terms of what the value of the game is. It was really important to us that we were being honest, and that our community understood that we were doing this because it was in their best interests to have a really, really strong community. It wasn’t because we felt like we were being greedy, or because we wanted to nickel-and-dime people, which I think has been another one of the major concerns that people have had.

We are talking about other companies; there’s some more general trends and movements that we see. Do you see those same trends or is it all just unique to you?

We’ve seen those discussions about how companies are taking away certain features, or charging for certain things that used to be free. But we feel that this is different from a lot of the things that we’re seeing. This is really the evolution of our business model, and it’s really just us taking what we see as the next step forward. And I feel like we’ve done a really good job of explaining why we’re making these changes. Our revenue is still growing strongly, so we’re seeing a real business model for keeping this game going forward. We’ve always really tried to be transparent about what’s going on, and what the reasons are for those changes, and our community has been receptive to it.

That leads us to your new DLC store, and that seems to be something you are pushing a little bit, in terms of a difference from your competition. How do you see this working out, do you think?

It’s really just been an evolution of the way we do things. Over time, we’ve started to sell more types of content, things like skins, and those types of things. We’re trying to get more people engaged with the game. And the DLC store is just another way that we can get people more engaged with the game. And I think it’s going to end up with us becoming more entrenched as the way that people get their Overwatch and Blizzard gaming fix.

A lot of the decisions you’re making now are focused on making this a better business, or enabling the company to continue. But are there things that you wish you could change? If you have regrets about any of the decisions that you’ve made, would you say that they were too early, or you wish you did it differently, or regret something that happened in the past?

Not regretting anything specific. We try to think about how we could have made things better, because that’s how we learn, and it also keeps us from getting stagnant. And there have been times where we’ve seen players have very strong reactions to a decision that we made and felt like it wasn’t handled perfectly, so we’ve changed the way we’ve done things so that we could react better. It’s the same thing for the company itself; we always try to look forward and try to anticipate what the future will be like. There’s a lot of stuff that will evolve and change over time, but I think we’re on the right path for a company that has the strength and the longevity that we want.

Is there anything else you want to tell me about going forward? Maybe what your strategy is in terms of growth?

We want to continue to add new players, and we think that’s going to be the way that we continue to grow. We’re already seeing a big jump in our players number, and we are going to be continuing to add new features and content. And if you want to get some early access to some of the new stuff, there is the Halloween Terror, which is coming up really soon, and that will have some pretty cool content. And we also have a new event called the Junkertown Terror, which is coming up at the end of October, and I think there’s going to be more stuff in that.

What’s also cool is we’ve got some really cool new game types that are coming up that will be really good to get people engaged with the game. For example, the new battle mode, the team elimination mode, which is a capture the flag type thing. And the Overwatch party experience is going to be cool too. It’s a new thing that we’re doing, we call it the “Overwatch Game Night”, and it’s a way to have people come in and play with the rest of our players. It’s a bit of a casual game type experience.

We’ve always been willing to try new things and experiment with new things. It’s not really a choice, because we really want to make our games better. We see our player base growing, we see them coming back to our game for more Overwatch, because it’s a place that they want to play with their friends.

Obviously the thing is more complicated than just trying to build new people and sell them Overwatch and make sure that they keep buying it. But from our end, we want to grow our community, and that is our focus. I want to thank everyone who participated.
