I love bunnies and these are adorable, made with felt and soft natural yarn. The bunny is about 6 inches high but the ears are about an inch tall so the total height is about 9 inches. The tail is thick and sturdy.

This is my second felted bunny bag. The first one that I made had a bit of difficulty so I learned a few things to improve the next one. I will make another bunny bag soon.

I like that the ears do not point outward, they point straight up and are a little curved up. This is hard to achieve if you use plastic ear wire. The ears are attached on the back of the ears, not on the side as seen here on the web.

These bunnies have more of an adorable soft and smooth look, not coarse as some felted bunny bags. It is important to use a pattern that is small enough to make it easier for your hands to fit through the opening.

I recommend to make one or two bunnies first before you proceed to more.

Making a Bunny Bag Out of Handknits

Supplies:

1 skein hand dyed yarn, 1.75 ounce, in yellow (or in other colors)

6 inches of brown felt

2 ounces of medium weight acrylic yarn for the ears and tail

I used Bernat® Style 8, Flick, #3 (6/1), 100% Acrylic, Machine Wash, in brown for the bunny ears.

2 ounces of medium weight acrylic yarn for the ear wire

1 ball of brown felt for the nose

Small beads for the nose (I used silver plastic ones)

1 skein of hand dyed yarn, 1.75 ounce, in gray (or other colors)

A size G (4.25 mm) crochet hook and a tapestry needle

Tools:

Scissors

Stuffing

Felt markers, a permanent one, a pencil with two ends or a toothpick. These can be found at Michael’s craft stores.

Directions:

1. Cut the acrylic yarn into 8 equal lengths for the ears. These need to be long enough to sew the ears to the head and the tail together.

2. Lay the right side of the wrong side of the body on a flat surface, place the tail on it, about 12 to 13 inches long. You need to stitch from both ends to the top of the body. (If your bunny is headless and tail only, you will need to take a piece of yarn about 8 inches long and wrap it around the body from the middle of the tail to the neck to make the neck and head.)

3. Now, place the ears on the body. I used my fingers to help shape the ear into a sphere, then pulled it snuggly to get the shape right. Use your scissors to cut them with a point.

4. Stuff the body with the brown medium weight yarn.

5. Attach the ears on the back of the body with the brown yarn. Pin the ears onto the back of the bunny and sew around both sides of the ears through the top of the ears, stuffing it firmly as you sew so that the ears stand up a little.

6. Sew the tail to the center of the body, stuffing it firmly too.

7. Now you need to make the nose. I placed a large felt marker on the body between the eyes, between 2 and 3 inches back from the top. Then, take a toothpick and put it down where the nose needs to be. Pin the toothpick onto the body with it, right in between the eyes. Take the gray yarn, cut in a 7 inches length and wrap the yarn over and under the toothpick on the body until you have a triangle shape in the middle of the body. Cut the yarn and pull it tightly. Thread a tapestry needle with yarn and knot both ends of the yarn to make a tight knot.

8. Stuff the nose with brown wool yarn a little bit. Then, stitch around the head to close up. I used black sewing thread because black is invisible on the dark gray background of the felt.

9. Using the dark gray yarn, make 4 eyes with each two strands. Place a white bead on the center of each of them. You can also use a pencil or toothpick with two ends. You can make one eyeball with a toothpick. Tie the yarn over and under the back of the head to make the back of the head rounded.

10. Make two small beads on both ends of a toothpick and stick on the nose.

11. With the same medium weight yarn, and a size G hook, chain 7 (7 sts). Continue with a row of sc to create a wide oval of two strands of yarn running around to the right. Then make two small beading with two strands of gray yarn over the last stitch. Use the first and last bead that you made. It creates a little bit of a smile and the bunny looks kind of cute.

12. The pattern is very simple. I just used the basic crochet technique and I think you can use any of your favorite stitches. You can make one or a few depending on how many you want. If you want to make several and they are of different sizes, use different sizes of crochet hooks. For example, for the large bunny bag that I made, I used a J hook because the body is big. For the small bunnies, I used a size 3.

Thank you for stopping by and reading my blog, and be sure to leave a comment and leave me a link to your blog. I would love to hear from you. All your comments really help me as I am working on the patterns, so your suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Also, you can shop at Artisana Beads on Etsy. I know it is an old post but I am updating my blog now for almost two years and the items are still here. There are lots of new items too. I even have two more new items that are very cool to make funky earrings. Thanks so much for reading.

I used to work for the State Bank of India in a foreign exchange department. Today, I'm retired and doing some other things. My blog is a place where I want to share some of my ideas about crochet, the reason I love this. I think that the first crocheted item I made was a scarf and that was in 2006. What really put me on the crochet path was when my mom was very sick and I started making blankets for her to help her through. I have been crocheting ever since and I love it so much. I don't crochet everyday but I can usually find a few minutes each day to do a little crochet. Thanks for stopping by.

You're very welcome, Anita. And I agree with you on everything you said! Thank you so much for your lovely comments and following my blog. I am really happy that you have read this post!

I saw this at Stitch Craft Create in Toronto. I fell in love with this!

Hi Anita, I was hoping to get more information on the earrings and the bracelets and/or other accessories made from the earrings. Do you have a picture of them? Please? Thanks a lot! Thanks for the pattern!

I saw your post on “a friend”s blog – and decided to take a look. Your bunnies are quite sweet! And I really like your comments regarding the ears, too. We don’t have much “fur” here on the central coast, but I enjoy working with the wool that I have, and now I’ll be thinking of your bunnies.

I am a beginner crocheter and have been crocheting for 6 years. I am not very creative, just a very boring, straightforward artist. When I saw your project and had the opportunity to learn how to make something really unique and pretty with my craft, I jumped at the chance! Thanks for posting the pattern and making it as simple as possible for a beginner like me!

Please let me know if I should post a picture. I can’t figure out how to post an image in my post and I know you can do that but when I try to put my personal file, it does not work</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:55
