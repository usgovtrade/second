It might not be the best touch screen device for gaming as you may have to pinch, zoom, and swipe all day long to play those quick-hit games. For the most part, you can do everything without too much of a problem with the Acer Liquid X2 5.

You won’t be able to multitask, and that’s a drawback of this tablet. Overall, however, the Acer Liquid X2 5 is a great investment because it’s not an expensive device. It’s definitely a cheap purchase since it costs about $100.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 is another good 8-inch tablet you can purchase. I’d only recommend this tablet if you are a current iPad owner. There are many great apps out there for iPad, but it’s not the same for Android devices. For the sake of clarity, I’m not saying this tablet is a bad choice, but I would like it if you can first try the iPad first.

However, if you’re buying it for the same purpose as the iPad – games and apps – you might as well go with the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 because it’s got twice the memory. Most apps in Apple store are smaller than those in Google Play store.

It’s also smaller and lighter than other tablets, making it easy to carry around. It also comes with great specs. For a cheap tablet, it’s a great buy.

iPad vs Android: 8-inch Tablet Competitors

Below is a list of the best 8-inch tablet of 2013:

iPad Mini

iPad Mini 2

Acer Liquid X2 5

Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1

iPad Mini vs Android: Which Device Should You Get?

The most important consideration when choosing an 8-inch tablet is what it’s made of.

Both the iPad Mini and Acer Liquid X2 5 have a very similar design, which isn’t surprising considering they are both from Taiwanese manufacturers. However, you’ll notice that the iPad Mini has a plastic back and a metal frame whereas the Liquid X2 5 has a polycarbonate back and metal frame. You’re probably wondering why a plastic back is bad when it seems to fit better with the iPad Mini. You’re also probably wondering why metal would be better, but you’re right to ask these questions.

Most cheap 8-inch tablets are made of plastic which tends to bend, and this is exactly what happened to me. My iPad Mini actually bent. One time, when I picked it up with one hand, the frame bent and I had to get a paperweight out. It was terrible.

The iPad Mini, on the other hand, has a much stronger build.

When it comes to the Acer Liquid X2 5, you won’t have this problem since it’s so made of plastic and you’ll definitely need a plastic back to avoid such a problem. As for the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1, you’ll need a plastic back too. It’s cheap, after all, so you should go for the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1.

Acer Liquid X2 5 vs Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1

The biggest difference is in the processor. Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 has an A6 quad-core processor whereas the Acer Liquid X2 5 only has a dual-core processor. This could be a major factor in choosing which tablet to get.

Both tablets have the same resolution, but the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 has 1280 x 800 pixels, while the Acer Liquid X2 5 only has 1024 x 768 pixels.

The Acer Liquid X2 5 is available for $170 and it’s also more expensive than the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 at $230.

Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 vs iPad Mini

As previously mentioned, the Acer Liquid X2 5 is similar to the iPad Mini in terms of design.

However, the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 is the cheaper of the two. It’s around a third cheaper than the iPad Mini. Although it costs almost as much as the X2 5, it does come with twice the RAM. It also costs $100 more than the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1.

Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 vs iPad Mini 2

Although the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 and iPad Mini 2 are very similar in design and specs, there are a few differences you should be aware of before buying one or the other. The iPad Mini 2 is a little bit cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 and it also runs iOS which will not work for all apps out there. The Acer Liquid X2 5 is also more expensive than the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1.

In the battle of the iPad Mini 2 vs the Acer Liquid X2 5, I would say the iPad Mini 2 is the best 8-inch tablet you can purchase. The Acer Liquid X2 5, on the other hand, is better for tablets priced around $230. If the price is less than $200, you’ll be better off buying the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 which costs $230.

When it comes to cameras, you can get better pictures from the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1. It’s even got a 8MP camera on the rear which can record 1080p videos. The iPad Mini 2, on the other hand, only has a 2MP camera.

iPad Mini vs Acer Liquid X2 5

Here’s a list of pros and cons for each of the aforementioned tablet devices:

Pros

Better screens for apps, games, videos, movies, and photos

Better resolution

Better processor

Better cameras

Better build and material design

Plastic build and plastic back for the Acer Liquid X2 5

Cons

Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 vs iPad Mini 2

Both tablets have the same screen resolution, 1280 x 800 pixels. However, the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 comes with a dual-core A6 processor whereas the iPad Mini 2 comes with a single-core A5 processor. For gaming purposes, the iPad Mini 2 has double the memory which could be better for some than the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1.

The Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 comes with dual-band Wi-Fi whereas the iPad Mini 2 comes with only Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The iPad Mini 2 has a built-in MPEG-4 encoder and the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 comes with an on-board microSD card slot.

The Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 runs on Android 4.1 while the iPad Mini 2 runs on iOS 6. The Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 also comes with Bluetooth connectivity whereas the iPad Mini 2 only comes with Wi-Fi connectivity.

Which is Better?

The answer depends on what you need. Is it for a student or is it for professional purposes?

The iPad Mini 2 is better for students and casual gamers. The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 has two times the memory which could be a good thing for games. In terms of apps, however, the iPad Mini 2 still runs the most apps out there.

To sum it up, the 8-inch iPad Mini is the best 8-inch tablet out there because it has a larger screen, better resolution, better build and material design, and better apps than any other 8-inch tablet out there.
