For instance, the federal government recently released some of its guidance on when individuals could start receiving payments under its COVID-19 relief programs. Those plans, however, are still under review by the Labor Department. So, if states had to revise the rules as they begin to dole out relief funds, they may have an easier time doing so than if they had to consult with the feds before doing so.

Still, it is much too early to claim success in the states' efforts to implement broad relief efforts. The first wave of unemployment claims may tell a better story of how well the programs are doing.

As for the stimulus checks, the $1,200 payments are being doled out through direct deposit only. That means the Treasury Department would have to get money to every American's bank account by May 15. And that may be a stretch.

More Money:Trump and his family are reportedly planning to donate his $400 million presidential salary. Is this a good use of taxpayer money?

More Money:Trump's Treasury is being overseen by a Goldman Sachs executive. Critics say it’s too cozy.

The stimulus package, meanwhile, gave Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin the authority to take up to $454 billion from the $700 billion financial bailout fund known as TARP. That authority expires on June 17.

Mnuchin has said he would consider tapping into the fund again if the coronavirus situation is bad enough. But it will be tough for him to do so, unless Mnuchin finds some reason to renew the program that doesn't require it, such as ramping up a massive coronavirus aid program.

For now, though, the government will likely rely on that $3.5 trillion in federal aid that Congress approved last month to fund a historic relief effort to individuals and businesses affected by the virus. That's far less than the $8 trillion that Trump has been saying he needs. And it's not what many experts and lawmakers were hoping for when the pandemic started.

“We wanted, in part, to ensure that all Americans have immediate resources at their disposal,” Mnuchin said in a call with reporters on Wednesday. “That will help to get the economy going back up. And once the economy is back up, we can also look to help corporations.”

The relief programs won’t fully get Americans back on their feet or cover the costs of their lost incomes. Many Americans are still losing wages — often in double-digit percentages — as businesses around the country close up shop, shut down temporarily or tell their employees to stay home.

But the federal government, along with states, has begun to offer billions of dollars in loans and other assistance for small businesses and individuals. It has also rolled out a variety of tax credits and other assistance for consumers.

The federal government has also moved to expand direct payments to Americans. The $1,200 will be delivered on April 6 — the same day as a massive monthly Social Security check — through direct deposit or paper checks in a matter of days.

The Treasury Department has said it will spend $250 billion to expand the relief programs through May.

Many Democratic presidential candidates have pushed to expand the relief measures beyond the coronavirus pandemic, including providing assistance to individuals struggling to pay for health care and college costs.

“We need to make it abundantly clear that a lot more help is coming,” said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who spoke at the University of Wisconsin. “What we’ve done so far to help, it’s a drop in the bucket. We need the feds to go further.”

Meanwhile, there’s a growing sense of uncertainty.

Some small businesses are likely to be forced to lay off their employees. Companies are struggling to stay afloat, especially in the wake of layoffs, as they wait to see how quickly the economy and consumer spending will rebound. Small businesses are reporting that their cash reserves are still at a low level compared with several months ago.

The American Trucking Association estimates that the economy is already losing about 1.7 million drivers, truckers and warehouse workers, who are being told to stay home.

And, as if on cue, more signs are appearing of a looming recession. Auto sales plummeted 23% in March. Manufacturing activity declined last month at its fastest pace since December 2008, as manufacturers have been forced to slow production to comply with federal government-imposed restrictions on normal operations. The retail and hospitality sectors have also been hit hard in recent weeks as people are asked to stay home.

In March, businesses have continued to warn investors of the toll of the coronavirus on their businesses. Many retailers have said they are seeing a decline in demand, while auto sales are tumbling across the country.

The president has said he will use executive authority to take aggressive action to boost the economy. The administration has hinted that they will push to enact a trillion-dollar stimulus plan. Trump has said he wants to get more money to small businesses so they can provide jobs to the workers that remain, though it’s unclear how he would pay for such a measure.

Democratic presidential candidates, meanwhile, are calling for more robust federal aid to individuals and businesses that have taken major hits as a result of the virus. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., proposed a $2 trillion bill that would fund major relief programs for individuals and business owners and workers.

Warren says she wants businesses that can still operate to get assistance so they don’t have to lay off workers or close their doors entirely.

“You need to help them find ways to stay in business that don’t depend on the people they’ve laid off or who are sick,” she said at a Washington Post event.

Even though Trump continues to put a positive spin on the economy, there are many</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:01
