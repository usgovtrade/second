In early 1273, the Dominicans under the leadership of John de Sancta Maria, 
returned to the Dominican Priory in Santiago. Among those taken prisoner 
during their journey was Pedro de Santarona, the alcalde of 
Vieja--Santiago's oldest city--whom they brought to Santiago to face the 
judge.  He was later pardoned and appointed the rector of the College of 
Puerto de Santa María in Santiago.

On March 25, 1273, the Order of Preachers returned with the friars who had 
been in Spain, and had in their possession, the great treasure which the 
Gutiérrez family had managed to get together before taking flight.  This 
treasure included several paintings, some coins, two reliquaries and a 
manuscript codex in the French language.  The Order placed them in the 
Library of San Millán in a vault over which were the words, "Ego Dominus 
est" ("I am the Lord").

In 1274, King Ferdinand IV. of Castile was able to pay the debts of the 
pilgrims and thus remove the Order of Preachers from a precarious financial 
position.
