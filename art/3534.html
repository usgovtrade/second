When it came to developing a story, "one of the ways that we were able to create something new was to have multiple brains thinking about the story, coming up with stuff," said Lucas. "We definitely have a team of four or five artists who were working on the ideas and coming up with concepts and ideas, so there's definitely a lot of collaboration."

Fans of the series can rest assured that with the new creative team, "The Clone Wars" won't lose what fans loved about the original series. "We knew the DNA of what made the original great; we didn't want to lose that. What we tried to do was find the visual language of the original in the way that the audience perceived the original," Lucas said.

"What's interesting about working on something for five years is that we did get better, so what I see in season three is the thing that I'm most excited about, so it's not everything I did from the first three seasons."

Season three is set to premiere on the Disney Channel in 2014.
