The approval was given to the Hercare society, on Friday, through which a total of 75,000 units will be constructed for the poor and weavers communities over the next four years.

"This is a gift for the poor in Bengaluru. This is going to give a new life to the weavers and the poor of this country," P.M. Chandrashekhar, BBMP commissioner said in a statement.

"There is a need for a special development for this area," Chandrashekhar added.

The decision was taken following Bengaluru Development Minister C.H. Anand's visit to the area in December 2016, where he had witnessed the plight of the poor who make do with dilapidated houses built on the outskirts of the city.

The BBMP, with the help of a Rs 1,000-crore fund approved by the central government, will work on infrastructure development with a focus on the areas under Kaval Byepath Phase 2-5.

The project will cater to about 3,000 families who lost their houses due to the Byappanahalli sub-station collapse in August this year.

Touted as one of the world's greenest housing projects, the project will be constructed with the aid of special facilities, such as solar pumps that will replace borewells. (ANI)
