“We wanted to better understand the relationships among these variables,” study leader Dr. Jennifer Rider from the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, told FoxNews.com.
The researchers began their work by studying male blood plasma obtained from donors of European ancestry — more specifically the UK Biobank — a large-scale, longitudinal study involving about 500,000 men and women aged 40 to 69 years old.
Each participant in the study was asked to undergo four simple medical tests — waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, body mass index and a blood test for C-reactive protein (CRP), which serves as an indicator of inflammation.
The results showed that middle-age CRP levels correlated with average C-reactive protein concentrations in old age, but men who were overweight or obese in midlife and had high C-reactive protein levels were more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis decades later than men with normal CRP levels.
They noted that the findings of their study could only indicate a relationship, as opposed to proving a cause-and-effect relationship. However, Rider hopes the findings can be put into use to aid physicians in developing more effective treatment strategies for older men.
“Our research has been aimed at showing how some common chronic diseases are related over time and how that can be used to treat a person as they age,” she said. “If we can identify how these conditions relate early on, then maybe we can develop therapies in time to help people prevent some of the issues they face down the road.”
The study was published in the journal Aging and Mechanisms of Disease.

In most states in the U.S., you are required by law to have auto insurance before driving on public roads. Auto insurance policies can be complex, and even if you have your policy reviewed and renew it on a regular basis, you might still find it difficult to understand the various terms and conditions.
The best way to determine whether or not you’re getting good value is to comparison shop – by conducting a car insurance comparison. Comparing quotes with an agent or online can help you get better coverage for less money. Here are some tips on doing an auto insurance comparison to help you get more for your money:
You can also visit websites that provide auto insurance quotes and compare the results of their quote with quotes from other sites. Just be sure to check the qualifications of each site.
3. Make sure you’re getting value
Even if you’ve done everything correctly, it doesn’t mean that you’ll automatically get the best rate available. You can minimize the risk of having your car insurance policy cost more than necessary by being prepared and shopping around for the best rate. Use the above steps to help you compare the benefits of different coverage levels and get great auto insurance protection for less money.
A group in the UK claims that some medical devices aren’t as safe as we are led to believe and that we need more data on them, rather than less. That’s just what this group believes too, which is why they are asking others to join them and sign a petition to get more information on such devices.
What the group is campaigning for is better data on medical devices in order to make informed choices about their use before proceeding. You see, what these people think is that when manufacturers do not publish data proving the safety of a device, they are hiding important facts that need to be shared with the public.
Many feel that such companies are being too secretive about what they are doing and why. This has led many people to wonder whether these companies do so out of greed or due to some other reason. However, so far no real evidence has been found to prove why these companies are being secretive about providing information on their medical devices.
There are a lot of concerns that people have regarding medical devices and the groups hope that getting more information from manufacturers will go some way in addressing these. Amongst the concerns the groups is trying to address include the following:
The cost of medical devices. This includes any related charges as well as any possible risks or issues associated with such devices
This kind of petition isn’t unprecedented. There have been other petitions that also addressed concerns about the safety of certain products but they were not successful due to the fact that not enough people agreed with them or took action.
A similar petition was started last year and it took almost two years before it reached 10,000 signatures. The group behind that petition was actually quite successful in convincing members of Parliament to take action, however. It is not yet known how successful this one will be.
Whether it works or not, only time will tell. It is still too early to tell how many people have actually signed this petition.
In spite of the efforts by the group in the UK, this isn’t going to be the first time that they will be lobbying for legislation that can lead to medical devices being tested more. Their previous attempts have been successful to some extent but there have also been others that have not been so lucky.
However, this issue isn’t going away anytime soon, so medical device manufacturers will need to continue trying to address the concerns of such groups in order to prevent their products from becoming the target of any more petitions in the future.
These findings suggest that men might be able to change their eating habits or even increase their physical activity level in order to help them improve their cardiovascular health. These benefits might not just apply to male office workers but also might apply to the overall population as well.
