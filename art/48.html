considering suicide.  I know people with better brains than you.  And I
am talking brain, not just a brain.  Not only have I had the pleasure of
being associated with the very intelligent (that is how I found you
on the phone) but I've had the displeasure of interacting with you.  You
are extremely smart,  even when you are dumb.   

I could write a book on the dangers of the mentally retarded.  The
stupid, doped out, emotionally-ill people in this world are a huge
problem.  This world needs to step back and really  look at those
who "know" nothing and are out of touch.  I am no victim, but I do have
very good reasons to believe you could be a danger to yourself and
others.  You need help.  Call somebody.  Your life could be saved.
In fact, your life may be in danger.

There is too much pain in this world,  and I am beginning to think that
anyone with any intelligence should seriously look into suicide as a
solution.  It is always a great solution if you make it really look
like an accident.  

I am talking about this because it concerns me and it is a big problem.
You are only harming yourself if you do this.  I think you know this.
But you are still going to be dead.  I think that your life would be
saved if you were to move.   And move in with people who actually care.
I know you want to move on, but you must do it in a smart way.  You
may want to move, but your life is not worth a damn at this point.
And the person who will have the hardest time after you are gone will
be your best friend.  She will be left with memories of you, and your
body will be found with all sorts of things like razor blades and
bottles of pills in her mouth.

So I'm going to say this again:  Call somebody.  I can't tell you why
any more than I can tell you why I care so much.  But I do care about
you and your life.  And I'm really worried that you might be a danger to
yourself.  If you aren't a danger now, I would like to know who else is
in danger and why you are hanging out with them.  This is all a major
problem.  I need to know what you are up to.   You are so lucky to be
alive.  And that's the way you should be living.

I can't keep writing all day, so I'm going to stop.  I have to get
to bed.  I hope you get help.  You really don't want to live the way
you are.  It is a shame.
