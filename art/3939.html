"Brenda, is this your cousin?" "I didn't know she had a cousin." "You remember" "Bobby." "Oh, yes!" "I remember Bobby." "He's working down in Bakersfield now." "You know, down in the oil fields." "Oh, oil." "Of course." "I heard about that." "How are you?" "I'm OK." "Hello, Bobby." "Glad to see you again." "Rudy, I don't want you to think of me as a cousin or a freak or anything." "Well, I never wanna think of you as a freak." "Hey, Bobby, come over here." "You know, if the pickings are slim, why don't you go to Vegas with me?" "Forget it, guys." "You don't have enough money to get in." "We'd clean up." "Now, that's enough, you two." "No, I'd really like to see Vegas." "OK, Bobby, I'll buy the tickets." "Yes." "You're on." "But I can't afford it." "Sure you can." "You wanna go to Vegas?" "OK." "Let's go to Vegas." "Let me get on my skateboard." "Well, you can't go to Vegas like that." "You gotta wear clothes that are appropriate." "Here." "At least a shirt and shoes." "No, look." "What about this?" "We'll get clothes when we get there." "OK." "And listen, you guys... you don't have to go in with me if you don't want to." "Hey, I don't want to go, but he's already bought the tickets." "And it wouldn't be right to take his money... and not go with him." "Thank you very much." "Thanks." "OK, now." "I hope you both rot in hell!" "All right." "OK, we're ready." "Everybody, try to look like businessmen." "Right." "No acting now, Rudy." "All right, we're all ready." "We'll let Rudy do the dirty work." "Are you all right?" "I can't do this." "I'm sorry, Rudy." "I can't do this." "Just stay put." "We'll be out of here in a minute." "Why don't you just let me stay here?" "I'm no good to you, and I have to get out of here anyway." "I can't wait for you, 'cause I have to leave now." "You're gonna get into trouble, and I don't want you to get into trouble because of me." "Rudy, I gotta go anyway." "All right." "Look... there's something you could do for me that would make me very happy... and you could do it if you wanted to." "I don't understand." "I think you do." "No, I don't." "Is it sex?" "No." "No, it's nothing like that." "Would you do something you don't want to do... for the sake of somebody else?" "You want me to do a favour for you?" "Would you?" "You're just saying words, you know." "That's right." "Just to get me to do it." "No, really, I would do it." "But I would be glad... if you did." "You sure you wouldn't rather do it?" "Yeah, I'm sure." "I'd love to do it." "Well, all right." "So where do we go?" "Out that door to the right." "Here's the hotel." "Can I ask you something personal?" "What?" "It's a little personal." "Go right ahead." "Well, why do you do that with your nose?" "What?" "Put your hand up there." "Well, I got a tiny little hump in my nose." "When I was a kid, my nose was so cute, the doctor said..." "Let's go." "Let's go." "Come on." "We don't want to get caught." "Come on." "Hurry." "All right." "Wait a minute." "I'm doing it." "I'm doing it." "Put your hands up there." "I'm doing it." "Thank you." "You know, you're beautiful." "You're kidding." "No." "You're beautiful." "You're a very attractive man." "Do you think so?" "Oh, yeah." "It's not me, it's you." "The way you look and everything." "You think maybe we could go someplace and talk?" "About what?" "About us." "I really liked talking to you at the bar." "Let's go someplace where it's quiet." "Well, there's a place like that down here." "Come on." "Come on, I'm buying." "Look at the money I'm spending." "You want to eat, don't you?" "Can we afford it?" "Yeah, we can afford it." "What?" "It's on me, Rudy." "Anything you want." "OK." "You pick the place, I'll pick the thing... and then we'll meet here and eat." "OK." "OK." "Fine, Rudy." "Can you get your hands off me?" "Just relax, would you?" "It's not you." "It's him." "You're not enjoying it?" "No, it's not that." "I just think he's so crude." "Oh, come on." "It's nothing." "Just keep going." "Don't stop." "I'm sorry." "It's all right." "You're doing fine." "You're doing fine." "Don't worry about it." "No, no, no." "Please, come on." "Please, don't." "Please, don't do this!" "Oh, Jesus!" "What are you doing?" "I'm sorry, Rudy." "I'm sorry." "No." "I can't." "I just can't." "I can't." "I can't do this." "I can't." "It's not me." "It's him." "It's him!" "Don't you want to eat?" "Why don't you come over here?" "Take it easy, man." "You're killin' me!" "Wait a minute." "Stop it!" "She's crying." "He hits like a bitch, man." "Come on, for Christ's sake!" "Oh, Jesus!" "Are you all right?" "I'm sorry." "I didn't mean to hit you." "I gotta make you love me, baby!" "I'm sorry." "You love me." "Sure." "Sure." "Oh, Rudy!" "I was watching you from the window... and I saw you down on your knees... and I saw him do it... but then you get up again, you get up again!" "I wanna talk to you." "Oh, Jesus!" "Look at this guy!" "He wants me to do a favour for him... so he hits me in the nose, right?" "Ow!" "Hey, what's the matter with you?" "Don't break it!" "But he's a total maniac!" "Why'd he do it?" "I told him I was leaving." "Oh, sure!" "That's it!" "You know..." "I'm sick of getting dumped!" "I don't understand this." "I mean..." "Why does he keep picking on me?" "When I was born, I was such a beautiful baby." "But, you know, they kept ignoring me." "They kept ignoring..." "ignoring me!" "What's the matter?" "What's the matter?" "Nothing." "Rudy, are you OK?" "I'm really not." "I'm having trouble at home." "Would you mind if..." "I mean..." "I know it's a hell of a thing to ask." "It's not that." "It's just I'm really nervous and I need to relax." "Oh, sure." "I understand." "You know, my best friend just got killed." "That's why I'm here." "This girl just broke up with me." "You understand, don't you?" "Oh, sure." "Yeah." "Well, I'll see you again, maybe." "Yeah." "OK, maybe." "OK, bye." "You can lie down, if you like." "I mean, it makes no difference to me." "Hi, is, uh, Pauline, is she in?" "No, she isn't." "Oh." "Thanks." "That's no problem." "Well, goodbye." "I'll see you again." "OK, I'll see you again." "I guess he found Pauline." "Goddamn it!" "I don't believe it!" "Hey!" "Come on in." "You don't mind if I drink alone, do you?" "No, not at all." "I have to go out." "I've got some very important business to take care of." "It shouldn't take too long." "All right." "Have fun." "Thanks a lot." "Come on in." "Well, hi!" "Well, hi!" "How are you?" "Ooh!" "I've got it!" "</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:44
