I don't need a reason to kill. Or was it the other way around?" "Get up!" "You are unworthy of carrying his mantle." "You got it, big mouth!" "You're unworthy of wearing the silver mask." "So you know who I am?" "You all do." "I'm not sure what your group is up to, but I want you to know that nothing, nothing is gonna stop me from getting my hands on the person who framed my wife." "Nice try." "You haven't figured it out yet, have you?" "I'm the guy who framed your wife." "I framed her so that she would get caught and you would come to her rescue." "So why are you wasting all our time?" "You really think anyone's gonna believe a twisted, deranged lunatic?" "A lunatic, yes." "A deranged one, no." "That's why I have her in there." "To prove that I'm not insane, that I am, in fact, sane enough to know the difference." "What do you want?" "!" "Your help." "You have two days until your wife's released." "If you don't come up with a plan, she dies." "There is a bomb under your wife's bed." "The wires are clearly marked." "If you don't figure out a way to disarm the bomb in 24 hours, your wife dies." "Do you understand?" "Do you understand?" "I understand." "Damn." "What's the matter, Spider-Man?" "You seem down." " Peter." " Yeah?" "Everything's gonna be all right." "Hey, you got nothing to worry about, pal." "It's gonna be all right." "Argh!" "My father and I designed this building." "They're headquartered there." "Love you, Daddy." "Uncle Ben." "I have something to show you." "You'll never believe who's here." "There really is someone." "They've got someone inside of there." "I'm gonna pull back the security footage you asked for and try to get a shot of who it is." "Oh, Jesus." "It's him." "I see the shot." "He's inside." "What are we supposed to do?" "I don't know." "What are you doing here?" "I came to stop you." " To stop me?" " Yeah." " Did you know?" " That he was?" "Yes." "I've known all along." "Then, why are you here?" "Peter, I'm begging you." "Take your wife and your daughter and leave." "Right now." "It's not gonna happen." "You're gonna lose." "Uh, what if I said you could have everything you ever wanted?" "All you have to do is rewind the clock right back to 1966." "Oh, my God." "Peter." "I'm begging you." "Please take your family, your daughter, and go." "Now." "I'm sorry." "He blew it." " He blew it." " No." "He blew it." "He blew it." "Jerry, for God's sake, tell him what he's won." "He's won a trip to Disney World!" "One little girl's life is at stake here." "You're an idiot if you don't take that deal." "A one-in-a-million chance at winning a family trip to Disney World!" "And I say to you, for God's sake, take it!" "Yes!" "Yes!" "Of course I'll take it." "I can't go to jail!" "Oh, my God!" "It's gonna be okay, honey." "It's gonna be okay." "I promise you." "I promise." "It's gonna be okay." "This is the police." "We have the building surrounded." "Come out with your hands above your head." "We have every exit covered." "Give yourself up and come out with your hands above your head." "Help!" "Shoot him!" "Kill him!" "He's got my daughter!" "Please shoot him!" "Go!" "Go!" "Don't move, or she dies!" "Peter!" "Peter!" "Please!" "Help!" "Help!" "Help!" "Help!" "Oh, my God." "Help!" "Someone help me!" "Help!" "Look, I need a wheelchair at rubdown twelve." "Right now, please." "OK, sir." "We're gonna get you up." "Come on." "Help me get him up." "Get him up." "Get him up." "Let's go!" " Help me carry him." " Get him up." "Let's go." "Let's go!" "Help me get him up." "We're gonna get you up and get you out of here." "I can't see anything!" "Put him in the chair." "Take him down." "Stay down." "Hey, watch it." "Watch it!" " You're OK." " I can't see anything!" "I can't see!" "No, no, no." "Sir!" "You've got to stay down." "You can't be up." "Carrie!" "You can't..." "We've gotta go get my daughter!" "I'm sorry." "Get in the car, now." "Come on, move, move, move!" "We're gonna get you out of here." "Come on, Carrie." "Get in the car!" "Back, back, back, back, back!" "Back it up, will ya?" "Come on!" "I'll take care of her." "You stay with him." "OK." "Get his head!" "Get his head!" "Get his head!" "Go!" "Stay with him." "Grab his belt." "Wrap the belt around him." "You're OK." "My turn." "You're all right." "I'm cold." "I know." "Let's get in the car." "Hey, watch it, will ya?" "I got his legs." "Just a second." "OK." "Put him in the back seat, will ya?" "OK." "All right, all right." "Dad?" "Dad?" "Dad?" "You're gonna be OK." "Is he gonna die?" "No." "No, I don't think so." "Could you get me some water?" "I can't drink alcohol." "I'll find something you can drink." "Hey, hey, easy, easy." "Nice and slow, all right?" "Put him in there." "We got you, buddy." "You're gonna be OK." "I got you." "I'll get you home." "Take me home, OK?" "Take me home!" "Dad?" "Come on, dad." "Breathe." "Come on." "I'm sorry." "Dad." "He's OK." "Oh, that's good." "That's good." "OK?" "It's OK." "It's OK." "Oh, dear God, no." "Oh, my God, no." "No, I don't wanna die!" "No!" " Hey, I need a doctor here!" " What is this?" "I want you to stay and watch this." "Ohh!" "I'm OK." "I can't." "I can't." "My father had a heart attack at 43." "I would have died." "But my father never ever gave up hope and I'm not giving up on you." "So you have to fight because I believe in you and you're not a victim." "I see you." "I see you." "And I believe in you, Peter." "So what do we do?" "We fight." "How?" "We start with trust." "Oh, God, help!" "Oh, help!" "Oh!" "No!" "Oh!" "I don't wanna die!" "Please don't let me die!" "Please don't let me die!" "No!" "Please, please don't let me die!" "No!" "Don't do this to me!" "Please don't!" "No!" "Don't let me die!" "We have to let him go." "Let him go." "Help me!" "I will." "I will." "Help me." "Give me your hands." "Help me, please!" "You're gonna be OK." "You're gonna be OK." "Dad?" "Dad!" "Peter?" "You all right?" "They're keeping me in here." "I can't go home." "I can't go home." "They won't let me." "I'm just gonna rest here a minute." "Just a minute." "You're gonna be OK." "I got you now." "I got you." "Oh, there you go." "There you go." "I've had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!" "Fuck with me, I'll fuck with you!" "You're not getting on this flight!" "No!" "No!" "You can't come on board..." "You listen to me!" "If we miss this plane, we'll have to wait two weeks." "I'm not staying two weeks in this fucking country." "I've gotta get home." "I gotta get home." "I gotta get home." "You don't understand." "I got somebody..." "I got somebody..."
