My home network goes through a wireless router, and I can connect to my internet and the wifi on my phone through that, so I don't know if that's your problem or not, but hopefully that is enough to clear up the issue. Good luck.

I know it is not the router, it is fine. It is that when I am browsing in wm I am using WiFi connection to get on the internet (I am with a 3G sim). And in my room i have wifi and wifi works fine. But it is not working in my parents house (no signal here, just wlan) I tried to switch SIM cards to my sim without 3G and try to get on the internet with 3G and then it worked fine. It's got something to do with the fact that I'm using a 3G SIM on wifi and I would like to get rid of the 3G if possible.

Hey,
I don't know anything about android/iphone/blackberry, but it sounds to me as if the router isn't compatible with your SIM card, probably because it uses a different frequency or something. Do you have another router? I have a few network routers I like to mess around with, if you want, and it might be an easy solution. Also, what make/model of phone do you have? It might be better to start there. Good luck.

Sounds like you need a 3G repeater (3G repeater) or the phone to be able to talk to the router. You need to make sure you have "access points" on the list of allowed network connections (I believe it's something like this). If not, it's either: -The network your using is to limited, which is really weird and not likely -The network you're connecting to has limited access point selection which isn't allowing you to connect to their connection or -The other phone can't handle the connection. Not all network are created equal and it sounds like your phone isn't compatible with the network. They're usually able to tell you, since it's all done through bluetooth. I can't guarantee how it'll turn out, but i recommend you check that out.

No, not in your router. If you have a network problem, it's probably with your router's 3G/4G adapter. It has nothing to do with your phone. Check if it's compatible with your phone in your router's manual or settings. If it isn't, get a replacement. I hate it when my phone doesn't connect with my router because it's "just a phone".

This does sound like the wwan is somehow interfering with the internal wifi of the phone. I'm not familiar with phones that use the wwan for internet access, but I did notice when I was running an unsecured network on my phone, my wifi wouldn't work (with the exception of my gprs/cdma modem, but only after the network was created). I tried it on all types of wifi, no matter what I did it wouldn't work. On the other hand, I was able to turn my wifi off and set my phone to use "Cellular Data" over bluetooth, and then it was able to find a wifi network, (which was an unsecured network too, mind you). I don't know if this is what you're experiencing, but I would definitely keep trying to find a way to get the phone to connect to the wifi without the wwan. If your phone turns out to be not capable of connecting to 2 wifi networks, or if it can only connect to the wifi on 3G/4G, then you'll have to pick which one you want to use. Either the 2.4G, or the wwan, but not both.

Actually i have an android phone and I think that even if you are connected to wifi your phone can still use your phone signal if your internet is on and the reason your phone cannot find a wifi is because there are alot of wireless routers out there which will cause the phone signal to go up and down, just disconnect from wifi if that is the case and use a good old wired connection!

Actually i have an android</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:19
