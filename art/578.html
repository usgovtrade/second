the commercial imperative, the "bottom-line," to provide a cost-effective, 
value-added product at the lowest cost to our customers.  Consequently, a 
comprehensive solution for processing, gathering, measuring, and reporting 
will be delivered as a multi-module product.

This "bottom-line" focus drives the following objectives for the Gas 
Gathering Solution:

Provide flexibility to our customers

The Gas Gathering Solution, under development by Enron Global E&P, is an 
off-the-shelf product that can be tailored to the needs of each customer.  
This ability to customize will e enable Enron customers to lower their 
cost-base by procuring only the functionality needed. 

Provide scalability to our customers

The Gas Gathering Solution has a modular design and is being built using 
off-the-shelf components to ensure scalability.  
The Gas Gathering Solution will also enable our customers to add capacity to 
their current gas gathering systems or replace antiquated systems without 
breaking the bank.

 Provide for a standard, scalable, easily identifiable product 

The Gas Gathering Solution is designed for standardization and interoperability 
with each successive release adding incremental value to the system. 
The resulting product will be unique to our customers, yet able to meet the 
needs of multiple customers. 

We will deliver this solution through a multi-phase implementation with 
initial deliveries in January, February, and March of 2001.

We believe this to be a superior solution in which you do not have to invest 
large sums of money to realize significant value. 
We are currently in negotiations with several customers for the release 
dates of the first modules of the Gas Gathering Solution.

Summary of the Solution

Module   Capacity
1  Supply:  4 Billion Cubic Feet Per Day
2  Pipelines:  10,000 MMCFD
3  Measurement:  4,000 MMCFD
4  Aggregation:  8,000 MMCFD
5  Storage:  4 Billion Cubic Feet Capacity

Each module of the Gas Gathering Solution provides a critical, incremental 
function, but when combined the modules provide a standardized, "best in 
class" product that can provide significant value to Enron customers.

For instance, the Supply Module collects, aggregates, and measures all 
natural gas production, including "non-gathering" production, in order to 
allocate the production based on a customer-specific plan.  The Gas 
Measurement Module validates the gas volumes that were used to provide 
customers with cost-based pricing. The Pipeline Module manages the physical 
transport of "gathering" production and "non-gathering" production.  
Finally, the Aggregation Module provides the ability to process volumes from 
multiple pipelines, the storage and measurement functions.

As development of the Gas Gathering Solution progresses, it will be critical 
that we are able to identify opportunities to bring incremental value to our 
customers.
