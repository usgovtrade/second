customer demand to build customer specific, less complex solutions.  While our 
customers are at the front line of this change, perhaps the biggest winners 
are our suppliers.  Broad application development has always allowed the 
supplier to differentiate between a customer with thousands of units and 
others with less.  The internet and e-business are increasing the volume of 
transactions and expanding the need to make each transaction uniquely 
tailored to the customer.  This trend will ensure that those who are able to 
develop online, differentiating e-business solutions will have an advantage.
  The challenge however is not in developing the solution, but in doing so 
without unduly risking the core proprietary Enron values of rapid time to 
market, continuous trading, liquidity, transparency, low cost, and scalability. 
Each solution requires a careful balance of these attributes in order to 
achieve customer value and to maintain our core business values. 
The requirements for each type of solution vary greatly in relation to the 
customer's specific objectives, the size and characteristics of the 
transaction, and the commodity. A good example of this balancing act is 
highlighted by the pulp and paper industry. Our solution for this industry 
was not to replicate current trading systems on the internet because such an 
approach could not sufficiently differentiate Enron's pricing or execution 
from that of its competitors. Despite strong efforts by a few companies in 
the industry to do just that, internet based trading of pulp and paper 
products has not developed, because of an inability to sufficiently 
differentiate these products from their competitors. The uniqueness of these 
commodities, coupled with our need for rapid time to market in order to 
justify these commodities as highly differentiated from existing products, 
has caused us to focus on another solution. 
When evaluating new business opportunities we examine the customer's needs, 
how our products and services can meet those needs, and ensure that the 
solutions we propose are consistent with our core values. 
Balancing these attributes of time to market, continuous trading, 
liquidity, transparency, low cost, and scalability with the need to protect 
our proprietary business model and unique value propositions is not easy. 
Ultimately, the design of the optimal model is dependent upon an understanding 
of the commercial context of each commodity we serve. For example, the 
optimal solution for a given customer in the pulp and paper industry could 
differ from the optimal solution for another customer in the steel industry. 
We have not always been successful in our business model development efforts. 
Therefore, we will continue to modify our business model based upon customer 
feedback and grow the business in areas in which we are successful. 
As the Enron group grows, we will continue to focus on the core values that 
have made us successful. We have been able to take advantage of our unique 
position as a market maker to help shape the development of new markets and 
products. In the future, as we continue to move ahead on the vision of our 
organizational plan, we hope to increase our overall profitability by 
continually looking for ways to reduce cost and find new markets for 
existing commodities as well as identifying new, high growth commodity 
opportunities to serve. 

 Trading 
EnronOnline is the first web-based, company-to-company trading marketplace. 
It brings the power of Enron's trading business to buyers and sellers of 
commodities and commodities risk management products every where these 
products are traded, with the added bonus of easy, rapid, and low cost 
execution. 
The average transaction execution on EnronOnline is two days. In addition, 
EnronOnline offers the first application that enables every Enron employee to 
enter trades and settle commodity transactions online. This wide-scale 
adoption enables commodity risk managers to manage positions, obligations, 
and dependencies across Enron's broad customer base. 
EnronOnline has helped lower transaction costs, facilitate greater certainty 
of settlement, and enhance counterparty relationships across the industry by 
allowing participants to better manage their physical and financial 
exposures, and to accurately value and hedge credit risk. To date, over 350 
different counterparties have completed trades on EnronOnline, and over 
1,500 people have been registered to trade on the system. 

 Processing 
Another key element of EnronOnline is the Human Resources application, which 
enables each Enron employee to enter his or her own trades and settle them 
through EOL. As an on-line system, EnronOnline and the Enron Intranet ensure 
that employees can transact Enron business wherever they are, around the 
clock, every day of the year. In July 2000, Enron became the first Fortune 
1000 company to establish an internet trading site for major physical 
commodities. In less than one year, this initiative has become the standard 
in the industry.

 Broadband 
In March, Enron launched its new broadband initiative, Enron Broadband 
Services. In the past six months we have seen a tremendous response from 
customers around the world, who have ordered more than 1,500 web-connected 
devices. 
With broadband, the speed of innovation is happening at an unprecedented 
pace, the future is coming quickly, and customers have demanded the 
flexibility to choose the best software providers. The future of the Enron 
Broadband services lies in its ability to provide customers with a choice of 
delivery methods, content, and services. As the portfolio of Enron broadband 
solutions grows, Enron will continue to be flexible and dynamic in our 
response to the marketplace. 
Enron also announced a wholly-owned subsidiary, Enron Communications, Inc. 
This telecommunications company, launched in June, is wholly-owned and 
managed by Enron Communications, which is the group responsible for all of 
Enron's internet development, engineering, and infrastructure investments. 
Enron Communications has acquired iconews.com and will launch e-TV, a 
one-stop-shop for video news and business information for commodity market 
participants.

 Investor conference 
Enron established its investor relations initiative in November 1999. The 
objective of this program is to communicate to Enron's shareholders and the 
investing public information about the company and its directors, officers, 
and certain employees. Information is provided, both in written and 
audio/visual format, on the Company's intranet. 
The program is primarily supported by a team of almost 20 professionals, 
located in Houston, who provide information to the public investor 
relations, media, and broker community by telephone and the internet. 
Enron was named Best Company for Investors by Personal Finance in two of the 
last three years. Last year, Enron was also named as one of America's Most 
Improved Companies by Fortune Magazine for the seventh consecutive year.
