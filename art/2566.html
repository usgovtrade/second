The only thing that will be resolved is how "good" the person was
to begin with. People can say they were good, and some of them were
good, but none of them were saintly. People usually want to judge
people by their appearance and it is easy to do so since some people
are easy to judge. The judge would have to make a decision of whether
they are a bad judge. How people judge other people has an enormous
impact on whether people act kindly or kindly of them are not. All
people act kind, but people judge other people by appearances.
Everyone has to judge someone in order to survive and everyone does.

I am glad the judge was lenient and decided that the girl should get
justice from her school. I have been an advocate for people who
are not given justice. I am appalled by how the legal system
treats people, especially women. I really don't care how bad they
are, all people are basically good. One would have to be really
hard hearted to be a judge and I am glad they are all gone
including Richard Nixon. If everyone were like me it would
be better for everyone. The only people I don't want to be
kind to are the ones who are just to cruel to be kind to.

I don't think being a judge is hard.
You just need to be honest, impartial and fair. You have to be sure
you are going to be the judge that the victims would want. I don't
think a judge should ever do the wrong thing, but the justice
system is already set up to send people to jail for the slightest
thing and we should expect the judge to be tougher on the people
they are appointed to handle. A few people are so rotten that they
will do any wrong thing they can do to people. I know some people
when they are in a rage and they will do things to protect and help
themselves or their loved ones but I am not for being too harsh on
others, even though I am also an advocate of victims rights.

Justice is only done when you get the justice you deserve and
usually you don't know that until you are at the end of your life.
There is a big difference between a just person and a judge, and the
judges seem to look for justice that favors the guilty. The most
important thing is that we are all innocent until proven guilty in a
court of law. If someone is convicted of a crime then their fate is
already sealed. But in the eyes of many people who are still
innocent are put in jail, especially if they are young. Sometimes
the victims themselves are put in jail.

What would it mean to someone who was a victim?
A bad judge doesn't do the right thing, never does the right thing
ever. A good judge doesn't have to go out of their way to be kind.
We all act according to our nature. We don't like to do bad things
but some people are better than others at doing good things. A judge
who would act kindly would be a very good judge indeed. I suppose we
all have a basic nature and people who don't seem very nice on the
surface are not much different than everyone else but people who do
nice things every day are so much better. I can tell you right now
that people would be happy if it were a nice person like me that
judged. It's like with your parents that you have to be sure that
they aren't going to be evil. They aren't going to be evil at all,
and you have to believe that. If someone can't believe that someone
is good, then it is very hard to trust them. Sometimes they are not
just selfish like many parents. They may also be bad. It is just
hard to believe it. But if you can believe it, it is nice.

Everyone has the same nature. That is why people like it when
people are mean to them. It gives them an excuse to act mean to
others. It is like when a parent punishes a child by not giving the
child what he wants, the parent is happy because he was the one who
asked for the punishment. If people don't punish children then there
is nothing for them to learn. In a way, there is no punishment for
parents at all. The same can be said of a very good judge. Someone
can't be judged just because he deserves it, but because the judge
can only think about justice for the sake of justice not for anything
else, there is nothing to punish someone who is kind but it is not
very fair. It isn't fair that people cannot be punished, but since
they don't deserve to be punished anyway, there is nothing you can
do. If there was a God, he would be a judge but it doesn't seem like
there is a God anymore. No one in the system likes it when someone
goes against the law. So they don't care about people who do good
things. That doesn't make them a bad judge. It doesn't even make
them mean but it does mean that when they are given the job of being
a judge, they have no choice but to punish the criminals who they
would see as the guilty. I think you would think they are too
cruel, but that is really unfair. All a judge has to do is say
everyone is innocent until proven guilty and that is what they need
to say because everyone is innocent until proven guilty. They can't
say all of the people are guilty. There would be no justice if they
did. It isn't fair for them to punish someone when they are not
criminals.

"I suppose we all have a basic nature and people who don't seem very nice on the surface are not much different than everyone else but people who do nice things every day are so much better.

We all are all guilty of something. It doesn't really matter if you
want to believe you aren't guilty of something, it doesn't really
matter because you are, no one is innocent. The justice system is
designed to punish people and if they were innocent it wouldn't be so.
So, even the innocent are guilty of something if they never went
through the court system. The innocent have to believe they are
guilty because the law says they are guilty, so it is true, they are
guilty. That is why the law says they are innocent, it isn't true
they are innocent, but because they are innocent, the person who was
wronged does not have to pay for what they did.

I don't think there is any such thing as "basic nature". Not every
human being is guilty of the same things at the same time. There is
no such thing as a "basic nature". Everyone is different. Some people
are bad, some people are good, but no one is all that good and no one
is all that bad, and we should not talk about people like we are. It
isn't like the judge doesn't know, I mean he obviously knows what is
good for himself. So it isn't like he is stupid or ignorant or
naive. If he is acting kindly then I am sure he is being kind, so he
doesn't know how good he is at being kind. He knows that he is being
kind and he is being kind. He is being kind and he is good, that
is what everyone is being in a courtroom, it is what people are being
in the courtroom. I don't think it is so hard to be good in a court of
law. It is so easy that you can't really tell if it is good or not.
Sometimes they tell you how it is good. They don't always tell you
how it is good, but they all tell you how it is bad.

What would you say if there was a trial?
What would you do if it was your parents who was on trial? Or your
parents were on trial? What if they were not your parents? Or they
were good? What if they were bad? Or you knew them? You would
have to do the same if they were bad, just the same way as you did
in the case that someone was bad but you didn't know them. A</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:43
