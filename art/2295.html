Losing all her money because she thought she was using the power of wow when
she wasn't?

Okay.

I'd say this is the exception rather than the rule (to what was actually said,
not the story).

tl;dr "I thought I was using the power of wow, but I was mistaken"

Umm.

Told anyone in here they were using "the power of 'wow'"?

I thought it sounded familiar and saw in Google Reader and the news feed that
there were some posts about it.

Ah ok. So you just searched for "Power of wow" and found this particular blog
post?

That's nice.

If you didn't know what it was, you could have just done a quick Google search
for "Power of" "wow" to see all the relevant posts.

Yes. I searched with quotes because it's a play on words that makes me laugh.
It's hard for me to explain so let me say this.

I was trying to think of a play on words that when you read it the first time
you thought, "Huh, that's clever" without getting it and laughing.

That's my criteria for finding posts funny, if I can come up with at least 3
on a topic to chuckle. It's that simple.

If you'd ever been in a social/crowd event where your attention was on
something else you might get my meaning.

I guess I'm not going to find another opportunity to do this if no one sees
it. It's very hard for me to explain. I can't even understand it myself.

Like when I watch something on youtube and I look at something else on youtube
because I didn't notice what was on the screen, so I looked at another video.
This is like that except when you were staring at something and thought it was
stupid, so I was looking at another video.

Anyway, it was hard to explain so I'm over it. The joke was lost on you. Sorry
:)

Ah, I see what you mean now. Thanks for the explanation :) I read HN like a
_lot_ more than you probably do though ;)

So this is hackernews where randomness and off the cuff comments rule but this
link is interesting enough to make it through the filter. Let's consider this
a moment and see where it goes...

The author of this article made some money on the stock market but somehow
somehow got swindled out of it. Since then she says she's been thinking about
how the guy did this, and she has a theory, which i think is pretty unique.

What she theorizes is that the guy used her own understanding and
understanding of how the stock market worked against her. He essentially
pushed her into believing that something is good and so she jumps on board.
And of course the thing is a good idea.

What's interesting is that a lot of investors/traders do this. They're willing
to try things on for size but they're not willing to jump in at the deep end.
They are willing to dip their toes into the water, but won't dive in until
they see something obvious enough that they can take the plunge. Or they will
see an obvious opportunity or trade and jump in. They make this decision after
looking at the same thing with a cold, impassive and disinterested eye. But
this is only when they're looking from far away. In real life they never see
anyone's face, so they can't tell if the person jumping in is smiling. So they
feel more comfortable ignoring the obvious.

Of course as soon as they become aware that someone has jumped in they get
somewhat concerned and look more closely at this other person. Because they're
not exactly sure how good the other person looks. Their confidence was not so
great that they were sure they knew everything, but it also wasn't so low that
they felt the other person was obviously wrong, and that they should join them.
So they go through a brief period of uncertainty. Even if the other person was
obviously right they have to consider their own confidence. Is this the
confidence to accept risk? To jump in? To take on a risky business? Or maybe
is the confidence not that good and if the other person can make more money,
they should follow along. This may be the first time they're willing to admit
that someone may have seen something others missed.

This is when the other person gets cocky and loses their edge, because they
think everyone knows they are right. So they get cocky, and lose their edge.
They become so cocky that it doesn't matter what everyone else thinks.
Eventually they have so much confidence they throw their arms up in the air
and yell "Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!"

My opinion is that she's got a pretty good point. What she did is
overconfident. Maybe she didn't have that much information, but she felt it in
her gut that she was going to make a lot of money. So she took on more risk
than she should have. And she bet against her gut feeling, so she may have had
a good reason to do that, but she was certainly banking on her own confidence
getting her through this. Eventually she got it so wrong that she lost her
confidence. So she was losing money, and her confidence got worse. She may
have even started to believe what she was telling everyone was just wrong, and
so she started calling herself crazy, and started losing confidence. She got
left behind by everyone else, so she started watching others closely. She
started watching the stock market in a weird way. She thought that some kind
of inside information or genius would give her an advantage, but that's not
really how the market works. It's like trying to learn a complicated
telephone system by reading the instructions for one person using a certain
phone, but not the instructions for another person. You'll have a difficult
time doing it</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:17
