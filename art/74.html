Instead   
of looking at me, staring as if I was   
an extraterrestrial or an alien, his eyes   
flitted from her face to mine and he seemed   
to know exactly what I was thinking.

That doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all.   
You have been in that house too. They know.

She has seen me.

In a second I was standing in the middle of a   
wide open space. He was in the garden,   
facing away from me, my mother was lying   
on a chaise longue beneath the sun, looking   
somber and sad, and I saw a child standing next   
to her with his mother's golden hair.

He seemed to be talking to me, laughing with   
me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying.   
A man called to me from the house,   
"Bobby."

"Over here."

There was a man beside me who looked   
like my father. He had long hair, thin and   
unkempt and white.

"It's me," he said, and the sight of him sent me   
into a rage.

"I knew it," I said.

"What are you doing here?"

"I don't know."

"Where is she?"

"She's over there," and I pointed to the   
chaise longue.

"Well, Bobby, it doesn't matter. You've done   
enough."

"But what if I hadn't done anything? What if I   
hadn't . . ."

"Listen," he said.

And he took my hand and he said something   
and I looked at him and he nodded and then   
he dropped my hand and turned away and walked   
away from me.

"Bobby?"

"It doesn't matter," he said.

And then,   
"Bobby?"

The words had come out of my mouth like a   
ghost, the ghost of my father, not my father   
at all.

I stood in front of my mother, who looked   
at me but didn't know who I was. I stood   
for a long time.

Her silence seemed as hard and as   
blank as that last breath of air you   
expect to find in the bottom of a well,   
because you can't help feeling it's there.   
It's the place you have to look, the   
place you have to go to.   
You can't think about anything else.   
You can't think about going back,   
because there's nothing there to go back to,   
nothing but silence.

The sun moved in and out   
of my mother's eyes, her face was   
becoming a mask, and I thought about   
that, about what it meant, how we move   
from one room to the next, how we're   
moving from the living room into the   
hallway, how we will move into the   
bedroom, to lie with her, but we will not   
be moving into the bedroom   
but into her   
theater, into her stage, and I thought about   
that and thought about the place you   
go to when you die, to which you   
are taken, when it's your time to go.   
You get into that place, even though   
you're not dying, and that place   
is like a tunnel and it's dark and it's   
cold, and no one else is there, and   
no one can ever know how   
quiet it is, how lonely it is, no   
one can ever know that, because it   
is their place. They never have to   
leave it, and so they never know   
what it is, because they have never   
been in that place before.

The sun shone and shone, and my   
mother's body shuddered and shook   
on the chaise longue, and I thought,   
there will come a time in the night   
when she will leave that theater   
and go back to her room, and in the   
morning she will open the blinds and   
look outside, and there will be an empty   
stairway and a closed front door and   
outside the glass   
will be her garden, and her house and   
her yard and her neighbors, and her   
dogs and the sky, the sun, the wind, the   
lawn and the trees.

She will not see them, because   
she is a bad actress, and the   
actress does not see the audience.   
She never sees what she is watching.   
She is never there, for her.   
It's always someone else watching   
her, someone else in her place.

I stood and looked at her, and   
I said the word I'd never said   
before.

"Mom," I said, and I said it softly.   
I said the word because it   
worried me, because it   
had become a thing that belonged to   
her, the word her own, and she   
could say it whenever she wanted,   
because she could pretend I was one   
of the family she had gathered.   
And I said it because I   
was afraid   
that she would go back to her   
room, and I would never see her again,   
and she would never know what it was   
I'd called her.

"Mom."

I called her   
the way she called me.   
The way we are taught to call   
children in the world.   
The way we say it to the dogs.

Her name came up as I thought   
of the dogs, her dogs, her black   
spaniel and her boxer, her two dogs   
on the leash. And I called them the   
same way I said her name to myself,   
and   
that was a name I used to call   
my mother's dogs, the dogs   
that pulled my brothers and   
me around the yard.   
And I called her the way   
the dogs called her   
in the mornings   
and the afternoons, in the   
heat of the sun and the   
drizzle of rain, and I   
cared for her dogs the   
way she had cared for me.

I watched her, I looked at her, and   
she was looking at me, too.   
She was as white as I was, and her   
eyes were empty, just empty.

She was her name, the way she was me.

I know I saw it in her eyes, because   
I knew how she looked.   
I didn't need to look at myself   
to know how I would look.

I had no questions.   
I knew what I had seen, and   
I knew what I was,   
the way you know what you   
know when you hear a sound, the   
sound is familiar.

"Mom," I said, "we need to talk."

## What Is Home?

When I was a child, I imagined the world was   
a place that was flat and was full of clouds,   
and it was always dark, and it was never sunny.   
The sun never shone, not a ray, not a   
single ray ever, not even on the days I   
wanted to believe it was a sunny day.   
I imagined, too, that the world was dark   
and cold, and I could see why people wanted   
to be somewhere else.

My father is like that, too.

He went away to college. He went to Canada.   
He went to Russia. He went to Cuba.   
He went to London and New York. He went   
to many places. He was never home.

He went to the North Pole. He went to the   
South Pole. He went to all the places   
he was expected to go.

He went to places where he could live like   
a king, without anyone knowing.

I asked my mother why he had gone away   
when he was still my father. She never   
answered my question.

My father was never home when he lived at   
home. He was never home when he went   
away, and when he went to jail, he wasn't   
home when he came home, either.

He came home and didn't see us.

"He's not home."

He said that when he went away, it was like   
he was going home. But that's not the same   
as being home.

I know the time he came back from   
Cuba, he said,   
he was like a soldier.

"Like a soldier," I said, and I tried to   
picture a soldier, and I saw a man   
walking, a young man with a gun in his   
hand, marching, with a flag in the wind.

"No," my father said, "I wasn't a soldier."

He said he was a spy.

I said, "So why did you go to Cuba?"

He said he went to Cuba to see the war   
and the revolution.

"What did you see?"

"I saw a man."

"A man?"

"I saw the man who wanted to make a   
change, and I saw what I thought would   
change, and then I saw what was already   
changed."

"What was already changed?"

"I saw there was no revolution."

"What does that mean?"

"It means, my son, that I'm not a   
revolutionary. I never was. I was a   
spy, a man who was sent to spy on   
other people who were trying to be   
revolutions. The one in Cuba was not   
a revolution, but it was a   
revolutionary experiment.   
It's a revolution that has been,   
and it's never been   
remembered."

My father said, "You've changed,   
son, you've changed."

And I remember asking him why I had   
changed, and he said I was too small to   
change, and I was too young to think   
like I did.

I asked him what I thought like, and he   
said I was like the father who has been   
in jail and wants to change, but can't   
forget what he was before he went to   
jail. He was the father who was out   
in the world.

I asked him who I was.

He said I was like the father who has   
lived in the world. I was living   
in the world, and he was in   
the world.

I asked him why he never told me   
this, and he said because I was too young </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:05
