How to make sure the application is installed on the system

I've built an app using C# and WPF and I use the installutil.exe to install it. The problem is when I delete it, the files are still left over in the installation directory. Is there anyway I can stop that from happening?

A:

Take a look at the AppDeployment Toolkit for WPF: http://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=AppDeployment&referringTitle=Home
The AppDeployment Toolkit gives you more control over the process of how an application is installed, including the deletion of left over files.

A:

The WIX toolkit has some very advanced features for generating installers. Some of which are 

Delete all files generated by your application.
Have different install options (ie silent install vs normal install).
Install different versions on different computers (local vs network).

A:

Check out the WIX toolkit at http://wix.sourceforge.net/
It's a very powerful framework for automating windows installation.

MSI Installer Projects (Visual Studio Projects for WinForms and WPF)
Installers for Windows 2003, 2000, ME, XP, Vista, and XP64
Installers for Windows CE (Windows Mobile 3.x and 4.x)
Installers for Java WebStart, Linux, OS X and Solaris

In particular, have a look at the WixUIExtension, which can be applied to your MSI so that you can integrate a UI (a form).

See the wixUIExtension project, and here's an article on integrating WPF into wix.

The WIX WPF Integration project allows you to add a WPF User Interface to an MSI based on a WixUIExtension.

If you're just looking to use WPF, look at Installation Projects for WPF (and Installers for WPF)

Installing apps can be easier than doing it manually in Windows Installer. But
  it can also be much harder to debug when things don't work correctly. The Installation Projects for WPF project provides a complete
  developer's solution for application installation. In addition to supporting
  traditional features such as uninstall and upgrades, Installation Projects for WPF
  contains a unique set of powerful new features for more intelligent installation,
  deployment and upgrade of .NET applications that target the Windows Presentation
  Foundation (WPF).

Also see the following questions and answers for more info about managing leftover files.
What are leftover files and how can I remove them?

I've seen that several MSI installations leave the following files around after the installation has completed. It may be
   necessary to have some or all of these, but we need them to run the applications after they are uninstalled.
1) a program file called Setup.exe and Setup.exe.config
2) a registry key under Windows\Installer called "Install" and another one called "Rollback"
3) a "welcome" text file (sometimes not at all)
4) sometimes some log files.
  There may also be a .wixproj, .sln or .vcxproj file, but I haven't seen one so far.  If you have found other
  locations, please let us know here: http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/44016053/how-do-i-use-wix-to-uninstall-a-wi.aspx
  If you need to uninstall an MSI package, then you must go into the installation's 
   Add/Remove Programs entry in the Control Panel. It is your responsibility to delete these 
   files manually, because they can not be removed by any other mechanism (including add/remove 
   programs) within the context of an MSI.

How do I clean up after an MSI installation in an uninstall script?

MSI uses various ways to delete temporary data, files, and registry entries after an installation.
One option is the standard "DeleteFile" MSI action, which deletes a file in an atomic fashion. MSI 
   also supports the "DelTree" action, which deletes a directory and all of its files recursively. 
 
Both MsiDeleteFile and MsiDeleteTree can be used to clean up temporary files or registry 
   entries, respectively. However, neither will do any cleanup automatically after the installation has 
   been completed. This is because MSI files have a single "chain of execution". The installation of an
   MSI file is split into multiple phases (not unlike a multi-threaded process). The only 
   time-based events that can be raised in an MSI file are during these different phases.
