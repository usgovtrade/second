Last time out, we posted on the most recent wagers by the public, and it was about as much as we expected. The public was up around 16% on the Cardinals in Week 4, and the Underdog was up 5%.

On Monday night, the Cards take on the 49ers in an NFC West rivalry matchup that could determine the division winner this year. So far this season, the Cards are up 5% against the NFC West (2-3), while the 49ers are up 13% (4-2) in this same situation. A very tight wager here, but with more data we will be in a better position to wager on this wager. If you’re looking for something to watch on Monday night, check out The MMQB’s specials on the battle between the old 49ers and new 49ers in their first game.
