Heart is the organ which has vision to see the path ahead in our life. This paper is written from the perspective of spiritual practice in Buddhism. The aim is to see our path, not the goal. Path of heart is vision of self-realization and wisdom. There are three aspects of vision from the heart. (1) Heart as medium. Vision of the meditator is vision of self-realization and wisdom. The three aspects of vision are insight, meditation, and contemplation. (2) Heart as a spiritual protector. Without the vision of heart we cannot have wisdom, and wisdom without heart will lead us to the demonic path. Thus, protection from demonic view is also necessary for realization of vision from the heart. The meditator should not regard his path as separate from the rest of the world but see himself as a citizen in the world which is sacred, infinite, and whole. (3) Heart as light and heat. Heart is also the organ which leads us to higher spiritual realization, illumination, and liberation. If we do not practice and get a right understanding from spiritual teaching, our heart will not have a right understanding and thus will not be able to go ahead. When we take spiritual teaching into our life, our life will have a new quality. Then we can make use of all the blessings that have been accumulated in our life. Then our heart will get the light of Buddha and the heat of life-giving energy, both of which will allow us to go to the goal. When we come to this level, our knowledge will be completely different from before. Then we can see the right path and right activities and live it according to wisdom. Wisdom means to see the right path and the right activity. The three aspects of vision in our life is the wisdom, compassion, and activity which we should practice and cultivate. These are the characteristics of wisdom, compassion, and activities, respectively. To see our own practice, we should see the wise practice of Buddhism. We should keep right vision.
