Quiggly took his position directly behind the figure as though he were hiding behind a tree and waiting to ambush a trespasser. With a quiet voice, he called out to the young man, "You are trespassing on private property, Sir, you need to leave at once! This is private property!"

His low voice sent chills through the boy, who stopped and turned around, surprised to see a ghostly figure dressed in a long, flowing black robe with a white face floating in the darkness. With a sudden surge of terror, he turned and ran down the driveway. He ran across the lawn and toward the main road, leaving Quiggly bewildered.

As the boy approached the main road, he tripped on something and fell to the ground. Lying on the ground in the darkness, he suddenly froze with fear as a figure of a woman stepped from behind a large oak tree, also dressed in a long black robe with a white face.

With horror in his voice, the boy screamed, "Are you two ghosts too!?"

She stood looking at him without saying a word and seemed perplexed at his questions. She turned and slowly walked out of his field of vision and disappeared as well. The boy stared at his surroundings and stood up confused. He slowly moved forward, looking for any objects that would explain his vision of ghosts, but there was nothing there. He wondered if he had left his glasses or a cell phone back at the park and had simply had a daydream of ghosts. He reached up and rubbed his right eye, as if to erase the image of the ghosts and went back to his car.

A minute or two later, the car pulled back out onto the road, and the boy headed back to his job in Manhattan. Quiggly, however, had followed him back out onto the road and made sure he drove on to Manhattan safely.
