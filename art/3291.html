But I am really happy I found this site, and I can’t stop writing, I’m full of ideas.
Thank you, very much.

I'll bite, I have a solution to your problem.  
Let us solve the first part of your problem first.  The string $a is simply the string that exists between ' and " in your string.  And the last part is easy.  If you simply do $v = explode(",",$a); your solution to part one will be provided for you.  See code example below for what I mean.  
$str = "Hi, this is my first attempt at python, 
(my own coding skills are limited, no professional programming experience) and 
this is a test message to ensure that this website works, 
   it works.";
$v = explode(",",$str);
foreach ($v as $i => $value) {
    $final = $value;
    $test = substr($value, 0,4);
    if ($test != $final) {
        echo "You don't like that!";
    } else {
        echo "You like that!";
    }
}

The above code should do exactly what you want. 
You can find the PHP documentation on substr() here

A:

The problem is that " Hi, this is my first attempt at python," and "and " are not included in the word which you intend to delete, so 
preg_match('/^\w+(?=[\s"])$/', $str); 

Doesn't delete the rest of the sentence. 

A:

There are two solutions: 

delete everything between ( and ")
deleting the word " my first"
$str = preg_replace('/.*(\(.*?\)).*$/', '', $str);

delete only the first two sentence
$str = preg_replace('/(\s{2}\S*\s+[a-zA-Z\s]{2,}).*$/', '', $str);

\s - space
\s+ -  1 or more whitespace
\S* - not a whitespace

This one deletes only a certain number of spaces and then stops checking.
http://php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.repetition.php#example-24

Test case here: https://regex101.com/r/fH6kH1/1

However, I would solve the problem this way:
PHP example:
$str = 'Hi, this is my first attempt at python, (my own coding skills are limited, no professional programming experience) and this is a test message to ensure that this website works, it works.';
$str = preg_replace('~[^\S\n]+~', '', $str);
echo nl2br($str);

Console output: 
Hi, this is a test message to ensure that this website works, it works.

So you simply remove everything that's not a word or a whitespace.

However, if you want to remove everything between quotes: 
<?php
$str = 'Hi, this is my first attempt at python, (my own coding skills are limited, no professional programming experience) and this is a test message to ensure that this website works, it works.';
$str = preg_replace('/"[^"\s]+"[^"\s]+.*$/', '', $str);
echo nl2br($str);

Console output: 
Hi, this is a test message to ensure that this website works, it works.
