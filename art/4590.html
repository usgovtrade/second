When it was announced that the remake was coming out I was so excited! But with all the hate, rumors, talk of how white people should boycott the movie... I had a question for you guys: Will we ever see a sequel?

There’s a little girl whose dream is to dress up like a princess for her daycare’s costume party. Little does she know, but her fairy godmother knows her heart, and it will end up being anything but a day off.

A young girl dreams of becoming a princess for her daycare’s costume party. Her fantasy becomes reality when her fairy godmother hears her prayer. The fun doesn’t last long for the fairy godmother when her work assignment turns out to be the King and Queen of the Castle. If the King’s anger towards his daughter is any indication of the fate she faces, then she better run while she still has time, which isn’t much at all.

A little girl longs for princess powers. Her wish is answered by a fairy godmother who is really nothing but a powerful woman with a mysterious past and a love for all things magical. The only problem is that the fairy godmother soon discovers that if she's truly helping the girl become a princess, she's doing so for an extremely dangerous reason.

On her sixth birthday, Aria Johnson has become quite the young lady, having learned to play piano and taking ballet, but most importantly, she’s beginning to take an interest in the fairer sex. Her parents feel like she’s been in the process of growing up for far too long and are ready for a little “girl-time” to pamper Aria and take her out to dinner. She agrees to the dinner and asks only one thing from them, to attend a play in which she will participate as a dancer. When her parents agree to go, a handsome man from the theater comes up to them and offers to pay for their seats in the box office. Aria is convinced that he is an angel from heaven because he is giving away so many things that she could never expect a grown-up man to do. When they arrive at the theater Aria is introduced to her “prince”, and they watch the performance with a special connection.

Two star-crossed lovers from opposite worlds are brought together when Aria, a young girl who will one day be royalty, and Max Duffy, a human soldier trapped in another world, must save their universe. When a tragic accident occurs, they are forced to take the only path to each other’s rescue: make their way to the land of the fairies and beg the fairies to help them. Yet neither can make the journey alone...

The story of the princess is like a fairy tale in which two strangers meet and become each other’s rescuer. And although both Aria and Max have lived different lives, their pasts don’t compare to their future.

A beautiful young lady finds herself living a fantasy life after a terrible accident.

Aria Johnson has had it hard since she was a baby. Her parents had lost their ability to have children when they were unable to have a second one. As she gets older, she begins to fear that the same fate will happen to her. Her parents decided to give her a trip to the doctor to investigate if she will be able to carry a child. Although she was nervous, they were more than happy. The happy couple was overjoyed to discover that they were pregnant! The joy would be short-lived. A few months later, a man was trying to kill Aria’s father when he did something that he shouldn’t have done. He fell off a cliff and became trapped in another world.

When he finds out that he is an unwilling prisoner of a kingdom ruled by a powerful king, he soon realizes that he must get back home. Although the king allows him to leave, he informs him that he is now barred from ever returning to the human world. With the help of a stranger who saved him, Max Duffy, Aria sets out to find a way home. Her only hope lies with finding one of the mysterious portals that lead to the other world. The only problem is that there are other portals in the same town as Aria and Max. Without knowing who is friendly and who isn’t, Aria decides to stay with the one who saved her father. This will lead to a strange situation where she is forced to travel into a fairy world and find her way home. However, she quickly learns that this world is more dangerous than she could have imagined and that Max isn’t exactly the prince she thought he was.

In a world full of fairies, it’s hard to tell who is good and who is bad. A beautiful fairy queen rules over a kingdom full of magical beings with great power. But she has a little problem. When her son, Prince Max Duffy, was born, he took his royal heritage right away. His hair turned black at birth and it has been ever since. When his powers become greater and he decides to help Aria get home, his life is turned upside down. She’s not his princess, and he can’t let her go. Now it’s up to him to rescue her, but if he’s caught, he’ll be the one who will be in trouble.

For two young princesses living in the land of Oresia, every day can be an adventure. After all, no princess is ever alone. Princess Rihanna and Princess Violet were blessed with magical fairy guardians when they were born, but when Rihanna grows up, she longs for a real family. There is one person who can help with this problem. He’s got dark hair, beautiful black eyes, and is from the human world, but he knows every story ever told. As if this weren’t enough, his name is Max Duffy. Not only is he able to fly in the human world, but he can take on the powers of all the monsters in the fairy world as well. Together, Rihanna and Max must find a way to defeat the wicked Queen Bettina. But when Queen Bettina gets more of a hold over Rihanna’s mind, what’s a fairy godmother to do?

The day they were to leave, the Prince and Princess of their kingdom were killed in an accident, leaving Aria with no one to turn to in this foreign land. Aria gets stuck in the middle of a kidnapping scheme involving the king of the magical world and is forced to get help from Max Duffy, a man from the human world, to save her parents.
