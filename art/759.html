C-Man said he heard from Julie too.  I'll get back with her tonight.  
Maybe we can play Tues, Thurs-Sat next week.  But you better not have any 
more company events scheduled for me! 
Dave

PS  Now you see why I didn't want to give you the name of my new secretary!

Where were you playing?  Was it private or a company event?
