"After this we are filing the case under the child sex abuse laws, this is child abuse, it is a crime," said a representative of the child.

The police arrested the accused man on Sunday evening, who has denied all allegations.

The police have refused to register a case, saying the man did not have any contact with children.

The police however said they would take action against the people who passed on the letter to authorities.

The story has been viewed more than 800k times.

One of those who reported it to the police was journalist Rahul Kaushik.

On Sunday he said a colleague came up to him and handed him an envelope that had not been opened.

“This is a genuine cry for help, it's not about blackmailing anyone, but about sending a message. I'm hoping this message is heard,” said Kaushik.

The police however told NDTV that the man's behaviour did not amount to any crime.

On Wednesday, Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said he would order an inquiry into the matter.

"I feel sad. A lot of people have put their faith in government and I have told a committee that has been constituted to inquire into the matter that there should be action as early as possible," he said.

In a Facebook post, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the letter a "sickening incident" and said he would himself meet the four girls.
