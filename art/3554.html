[Hook]

We can make it better

It'll be better

We're going to do it better

We just need something to bring it back home

[Verse 1]

Babe my darling

You're my angel

I want you so bad

I can barely stand it

You're the thing I love the most

I can't leave you alone

We can do this better

That's what we need baby

[Verse 2]

We can make it better

It'll be better

We're going to do it better

We just need something to bring it back home

Don't worry baby, just breathe, you're not alone with me, baby I'm just having fun you see, it's okay if you fall down, I'm still here and I'll be your guide, but I'm all about you, you can trust me, just believe in yourself, and you'll know that you're everything. We can make it better

[Verse 3]

You're the one for me, baby, it's true

I've got so much more to give, baby, I don't care what it takes, if you're not mine it's just some kind of waste

'Cause I'm all about you, baby, you can trust me, girl just believe in yourself, and you'll know that you're everything. You're the one for me, baby, it's true

I've got so much more to give, baby, I don't care what it takes, if you're not mine it's just some kind of waste

'Cause I'm all about you, baby, you can trust me, girl just believe in yourself, and you'll know that you're everything. You're the one for me, baby, it's true
