"I promise to protect, with your secret safe,
"And never tell it to a living soul."
And then, in that sweet melody,
That's when the "love at first sight" set in.
Yes, she believed I had that "magic touch",
And I did everything I could,
To charm her with my charms.

"Dear," I said, "My sweetheart, where do you stay?
"I'd love to take you out this evening to dinner."
"I live over there," she said, "down the block."
"What a beautiful name you have, dear."
The evening was so sweet and full of romance,
The date, so unforgettable.
As I drove her home, at the front door,
I took her hand in mine.
She put her lips on my lips...that night,
'Twas the sweetest moment of my life.
From the instant I met this girl so fair,
I knew I'd fall in love with her.
It's funny how life will sometimes play us,
And just when we feel that someone's for us,
They just take us for a very long ride,
And leave us right where we started.
I gave her all my love, and gave her all my heart,
A couple years went by.
I went on back to college, came home at Christmas time,
Then we'd get together once again.
I thought it'd never end, no matter what I did,
But it seems it was for the best.
Because one day, I woke up in the park,
I found my sweetheart dead in the ground.
On looking through her things, as we did before,
We found these words written on a note.
"These gifts you gave to me were just the same,
As all the others I've been through.
So take them back for you're the one I love,
But I'm not the one for you.
In case you think I am, please don't get hurt,
And don't make the same mistake.
This is just a lesson I'm here to learn,
To never make a fool of you.
I'm sorry for the hurt I've caused, but so are you,
So go and live your life."

So I decided to go back again to the park,
And I looked at every tree.
But I couldn't find the tree I was looking for,
And there was no way that I could find.
I wandered through the park all day long,
Looking up in every tree.
And looking at every little blade of grass,
And just hoping and praying and hoping and praying.
"Yes, I'm looking for that girl.
I know she's out here somewhere.
I hope you're still alive,
And I hope you've made a good life.
I hope that she's still mine,
And she's sorry for having run from me.
And I hope that she'll come back to me,
At the same time if not a day sooner.
Then I will never look at another girl.
In all my life, I'll never look at another girl.
You see, I've been through a lot,
And I don't want any more.
And I don't have the time or the inclination to
Spend another dime on anyone but her.
So please just know that I'll never hurt you again,
And I never meant to cause you this pain.
I hope you've learned the lessons I'm about to teach.
And the lesson I'm trying to teach is;
You can do what you say.
I can't go through this again."
I know what you're thinking,
I know what you're thinking, too.
And you're probably thinking this is another one of my
My little tall tales, of love at first sight.
This girl I met in the park,
And you can say that you don't believe,
But I know in my heart and my soul that I did.

This girl I met in the park,
And you can say that you don't believe,
But I know in my heart and my soul that I did.

There was a time in my life,
Where everything was filled with laughter and mirth.
Everyone I met, seemed to be filled with joy,
And for a time I believed.
It was a time, where as long as you were happy,
You were rewarded, with happiness and good feelings.
It seemed as if happiness was never to be taken away,
And then I realized that I was wrong.
I met this girl, that's who I'll never forget,
Because she truly broke me down.
I met her in a parking lot of a restaurant.
I can't really explain how it all happened.
Because I got back in my car and tried to drive away,
But I was so ashamed of what I'd done.
She went on ahead and came out of the restaurant,
And she came up and started talking to me.
As I got out of my car, I said, "I don't think,
We have anything to talk about."
And she said, "Oh, yes we do.
Because if I don't talk to you right now,
I never will again."
And I said, "What do you mean?"
She said, "There's someone else I've been talking to,
And he's much better than you will ever be."
And she said, "He's so much better,
That I've decided to go with him."
And I started to cry, it made me feel so ashamed.
And I said, "I don't want to be your lover.
I just want to be your friend."
And she said, "That's not my choice."
And I said, "It's my choice."
And she said, "But it's been made for me.
But just one thing I want to know."
And I said, "What's that?"
And she said, "When you drive home tonight,
I don't want you to stop and turn around.
I want you to keep going.
Because I'm in love with someone else."
And I said, "I just can't believe that you're doing this to me."
And I said, "When I first met you,
I thought I would fall in love with you.
It seems so funny now how wrong I was,
Because I never really had you in my heart at all."
And she said, "I feel the same way, too.
I think I should call him right now."
And she called him up and talked to him for hours.
And we cried together from deep within our hearts.
And I said, "We'll meet again someday,
I know it in my heart and in my soul.
I hope you come back, I hope you come back, I hope you come back,
And I hope that you've had the best of times.
I hope that you were true to your heart,
But I know that love is true and right.
I know it's never too late for true love,
I hope you can see how we can come back.
I hope you can see how wrong it was of me,
To say that I couldn't live without you.
I hope you can see how much I love you,
And I hope you'll let me love you and be your friend."

There was a time in my life,
Where everything was filled with laughter and mirth.
Everyone I met, seemed to be filled with joy,
And for a time I believed.
It was a time, where as long as you were happy,
You were rewarded, with</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:32
