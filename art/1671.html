As a reminder, Brochachos are basically a cross between Jewish latkes and donuts.

They are deep fried and usually filled with cheese, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, sometimes onions and are usually rolled in shredded lettuce.

It’s the Jewish answer to comfort food. Like mac & cheese or mom’s potato pancakes, it’s comforting, but in a very healthful way. Since we aren’t Jewish, we can’t relate to the taste, but the idea is interesting.

They are traditionally served with gravy and applesauce. Not exactly something you see at a Passover seder.

This recipe is vegan and doesn’t require meat or dairy products. We went vegan by accident years ago. We were in a restaurant and a friend ordered fish. After we saw that the fish was deep fried, we assumed it was served in a creamy sauce and decided we didn’t need it. We ordered and our food came out a few minutes later.

We were surprised when we saw what it was: fish, plain and simple. It was so good, we never looked back.

This recipe is super easy and fairly healthy. And, it’s vegan. Try this recipe for this special holiday meal.

We’ll be blogging about Jewish food over the next few months – I’ve always wanted to do a series on this and now I get my chance! There are a lot of yummy Jewish foods out there that people don’t know about!

This looks like a fun recipe to try out. I’ve never made any kind of latke before.

Brochachos look amazing. I’ll have to make them this year – they always have at our Shabbos dinner. And we can make them for our vegetarian friends who join us for the meal.

Thanks for sharing these recipes, they look so good! I love a good veggie feast, especially at Shabbat!
