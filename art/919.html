I also think the music is too fast. I think it would be better if the 
tempo was a little slower. And so, the student was dancing to this 
electronic music where there are no beats to get into. He got out of 
synch and was thinking how to get in sync. And it got kind of wacky.

was something

Spanish: 
There was something very appealing about the wackiness of the dance.
You can dance wackily and still have something to do and to be. And
you can also think in a wacky fashion about something without
becoming wacky. So sometimes it is a question of discipline in the
students.
In a situation like that he is not supposed to dance to the beat.

So what we are doing is giving the kids a challenge where it is
the music itself. It is not like it is a situation where the person
who has the music comes and it does not matter what you do. The
person who has the music always has control over how you do what
you do.
I do not think that dance is something you have to feel. Or when
people feel that it is fun and the way you do it makes it fun, the
more fun. People do not have to be doing wacky stuff, either. I

We have very interesting experiments about this. At the
University of Illinois the psychologist, Thomas Avery, studied
children and he asked them how they felt about themselves. And he
asked them if they felt very good or not. And he asked them if
they felt good or not. And he asked them, "Well do you think you
are nice?" And they said, "Yes. " Do they think they were

Spanish: 
said to the kids, "Okay. Tell the class." And they had to say
what did they do to show off? And then they went to the class and
showed off what they had done in class.
The results were very interesting. The students that liked to show
off every time that they did something they felt good about
themselves. The students who said, "Oh yeah I show off sometimes, "
showed off only sometimes. And the kids who did not show off, said,
"I do not show off." So if the thing that you want to show off
you actually don't like that you are the one that is not showing off,
what is like that? How can you have fun and not show off? And

feel good about that? And have the respect of that?
In other words, how can you have a relationship with someone? And
where you both are enjoying each other's company. But there is
more of a sense of "Okay I want to be involved in this."
Another thing, the study has to do with this. It is not just what
makes people enjoy themselves. The question is, "How do you
actually enjoy yourself? Is it to make other people laugh?
There is a whole thing about enjoying yourself when you go to an
artist show and the artist is creating and it is a special time to
