While I was there I realized that there are a few areas in the States that are very hard to live in. I realized that I really should have moved there many years ago!

I am looking forward to writing about the rest of the country and seeing the world soon. There are still many things to see and many people I need to meet before I die.

One thought on “I have no place to go home to”

Love your maps. The ones you were posting on Facebook about, I had to check out these ones as well. The world really does look like a beautiful place. I feel sorry for those in Iraq who now have to deal with ISIS and can’t get home. What a sad time in history for everyone, regardless of nationality.

I’m raising money to help out a member of our community, Victoria, a sexy smartypants who has a sex shop; & as such she is our newestFeatured Friend! In order to raise the funds, I’ve put together two campaigns. The money goes directly to Victoria to use as she sees fit.

I’ve added a line to the bottom of the blog (Main menu) to donate via PayPal ‘members’ have added a line to the bottom of the blog (Members Menu) for donations via cheque. It’s not required, but obviously appreciated if you donate more than $5 as a one time thing!

Victoria’s Fund

Now Victoria has asked for donations in order to help bring a couple of her models over from the USA. They will be staying with her, getting trained and helping out with the store over the next few months while they wait for their Working Visa Applications to be accepted. With a little bit of support, they could make some really good headway towards achieving their dreams.

Naturally, as Victoria’s Fund grows, so will the selection of fellow Canadian friendly models.
