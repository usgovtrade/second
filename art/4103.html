In this column, we hope you will find interesting obituary and death information as well as features on various topics. For best results, though, you need an obituary for the deceased and a short biography. In some cases, The Times will help with the bios, but often the information has to come from the families themselves. We welcome and encourage you to send in obituaries and other death information. We’ll use it for our online database and archives, and when we have additional space, we’ll return the favor by posting online those obituaries we are able to obtain.

I’m a descendant of Mary Stetson Freeman, wife of George Freeman, a Civil War surgeon. I believe she is also related to the Stetsons of the East Hampton Stetson family. Would it be possible to receive some information on this family, namely her date and place of birth, if any?, siblings and parents, both known and unknown, marriage and children, maiden names, residences, occupations, etc. Thank you.

Mr. Freeman, I am so sorry to tell you that I cannot find an obituary for your beloved Mary Freeman. However, I would be most interested to hear more about her in your family. The New York Times obituary for your grandfather, George Freeman, is online in PDF form. The New York Times had an indexing project of Civil War veterans and their spouses in the 1870s, and I found George’s obituary here. It would be very helpful if you could get his obituary to me by email. Once you have provided me with this material, I will do my best to make your ancestor, Mary Stetson Freeman, famous as well.

Just one question (if you’re still around), but what is the obituary status for some of the Freemans from NY city? I’m thinking specifically of Edward. If you can find a way to include him in your obituary lists, I’d like to be added. He was married to Sarah, whose parents were from the area of NYC you mentioned and may have had further family there. Thank you.

Hi, thanks for the reply. I cannot find his obituary, however. I will just assume he has not been added to the list and submit him if he is not in that area. Do you have any idea how his obituary ended up in the Rochester NY paper and the NYT obituary is in NYC? Edward Freeman was buried in the Hamilton Burial Ground in NYC on 10/1/1890. He is buried alongside other family members who are listed in their New York Times obituaries from NY City. In the 1920 census he was still living in East Brighton, Staten Island. Thank you,

I am trying to find the obituary of Benjamin Rynar, who resided in Brooklyn, NY and was a veteran of the Civil War. He was born in Poland. The wife of his obituary is Julia Rynar who was born in Litchfield Co., NY. I cannot find an obituary for Benjamin Rynar in any newspaper.

I was hoping you could help me with your records on the Freeman family of Brooklyn NY. I am descended from Robert Freeman who was married to Sophia Bierwiler, from what I’ve been able to find. Sophia is also mentioned in the wills, but I can’t seem to find any obituaries for them. Robert’s obituary is found in the NYT but he is listed as a Civil War veteran, not married to Sophia. I’ve tried all avenues I could find online and have had no luck. I appreciate any help you can provide. Thank you,

Thank you for contacting The New York Times Obituaries Database. While I cannot find any obituary for Julia Ehrle Rynar, I did find that she was mentioned in the obituary of Mary Ann Rynar, her sister. Perhaps a cousin or relative sent us the obituary.

I am trying to find the obituary of Sophia (Bierwiler) Freeman who is a widow. She is listed in the 1902 Brooklyn City Directory as a widow. However, she is buried in the First Reformed Dutch Churchyard on Manhattan Avenue, Brooklyn, NY. There is also a memorial stone for her in Mt. Olive Cemetery in Greenwich, NJ. I cannot find any obituaries or death notice. The only sources I have for her are a tombstone in Mt. Olive Cemetery, NJ and a memorial stone in Greenwich Cemetery. How would you find the obituary of a person buried in a churchyard or cemetery? Thank you,

I am interested in learning more about the ancestors of my great-great grandfather, John Gillespie, from North Carolina. I found some information for a Gillespie family in Tennessee, but I could not find the connection between them. I’m not very familiar with Ancestry and online records.

It was really nice to be able to find this obituary for my great-great-grandfather who perished in the Titanic disaster. My mother, his daughter, is the only survivor. Please keep the obituary available. I would like to print it and frame it for my mom’s house. Thank you

I have been trying to locate info on my great grandmothers mother Clara Burchard. I have found her obituary. She is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Manhattan, New York. Thank you for posting it. I do have her obituary, along with a few others, posted on the Geni website.

It was nice to read this obituary of my great grandmother, Annie W. Rinehart. She is buried in West Cornwall Cemetery in Queens. I have another obituary for her as well as one for another of her sisters. I could not find much online. They lived at the time in Brooklyn, NY. Thank you for posting it.

The following obituary for John P. Bickell was published in the “New York City Directory” in 1916: “Obituary: John P. Bickell. Died: John P. Bickell, formerly of Brooklyn, but for more than 20 years a resident of California, died at his home in Los Angeles, on February 12, 1916. John P. Bickell was born in Ireland, February 28, 1847. Mr. Bickell’s family immigrated to Canada in the 1850</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:18
