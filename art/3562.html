My husband and I have been talking a lot about having a surprise b-day for the past few weeks. When he told me this morning, I couldn’t believe it! He was planning on taking us out to dinner to celebrate the day, then having the night off to go and see some friends!

I don’t think he’s surprised me as much as I was surprised by the surprise!

We were out last night with some friends, and they happened to mention their nephew’s birthday is the day after. When I asked them if it was their first, they said no. It was their second, but their first b-day. Since I only planned on having dinner with them, I was kind of thinking, how great if he had a b-day party! My husband and I have only celebrated our birthday once in the past, since we got married in 2005.

My husband told me about two weeks ago that he had some tickets to a musical in a few days. When I looked for tickets to go see (since I didn’t even know they were going to be showing this), I found out that the first show was sold out. There were still tickets available to a second show, but that was sold out too.

When I asked my husband about it, he said he went down to the ticket booth and someone told him about the extra performance and gave him two tickets.

I am so thankful for that little surprise, it really was the perfect b-day for him! I’m still trying to wrap my head around the idea that my husband is a grown up now!

Hi! I’m Cee

Hi! I’m Cee

Thanks for visiting my blog!
I'm a wife, mother, and recipe developer in Denver, Colorado, making my own version of the "American dream." My blog is mostly me being goofy and share a variety of recipes as I navigate going from a stay-at-home mom to now working and playing outside of the house again.
Most importantly, I love to cook and bake for my family and friends. You'll notice a lot of delicious recipes, as well as less healthy but still pretty tasty recipes. I'm here for the healthy options as well, so don't hesitate to ask me for a vegetarian meal!
Looking forward to sharing with you all! Read More...</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:31
