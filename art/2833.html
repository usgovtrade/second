3) Jose Altuve, AL (1)

The AL’s best second baseman in 2017 also ranks as the AL’s most consistent. Altuve hits for average, and that’s pretty much all he does. But he also gets on base at an above-average rate and gets on base a ton. In fact, he’s hit .362 over the last two seasons, averaging 44 doubles, 16 homers and an all-around .352 average per year. That is remarkable. He also adds valuable base-stealing skills, which we discuss below.

2) Nolan Arenado, NL (2)

The most complete player in baseball, if not all of sports. What a beast. We knew Arenado was going to be special and he has done nothing but prove it, and then some. He’s posted a .303/.371/.558 slash line over the past two years, averaging 40 doubles and 21 homers per year. Add in 70-ish RBI and 80-ish runs scored and you have yourself an incredibly valuable player. To reiterate: he’s the best player in baseball, or at least he’s one of the top two or three players in baseball. He’s been absurd.

1) Mike Trout, AL (1)

In case you’ve somehow forgotten (you really shouldn’t), Trout was the centerpiece of the blockbuster trade that sent him from the Angels to the Dodgers in November of 2014. What he’s done in two years since could serve as a textbook example for how to get paid during an arbitration year. Last year he posted a ridiculous .362/.560/.760 slash line, scored 112 runs and recorded 40 extra-base hits, all while hitting .294, drawing 88 walks and swiping 40 bags, according to Baseball Reference.
