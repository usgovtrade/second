Use the preview button to hear each loop. You can download the audio demo song as an MP3 file from the Free Sound Bites Pack page or via the player above to listen to how the loops sound in a full mix. I recommend you play around with adding the sounds to the audio track in a DAW until you are happy with them, then save them as audio loops in your loop library for later use.

When you add an audio loop to a track, it will start playing automatically in your DAW, but if you want to edit any of the details of the audio part or EQ it with effects, such as a bus compressor, etc., you can do this in the audio mixer or mixer view. To hear the audio loop exactly as it appears in the preview, just click the preview button on the right, which will show you a waveform of the audio sample. Then click the button again to return to the preview of the finished sound.

If you are making music for a video, or if you need background tracks for a podcast, please visit the Free Sound Bites Pack page to find out how to download the audio demo song and get access to over 200 audio loops, including drum hits, synth sounds, synth sounds, and ambiences, and to view a PDF of this free e-booklet. I hope you find these loops inspiring!
