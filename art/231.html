Instead 
of getting the
reputation based on it
as other countries have
we actually have
lost reputation. And so,
that was one of the reasons
why we decided to actually not to
pull out of the Iran deal
is because to
my view that Iran
was still in compliance
and we still had 
the security agreement
that had been reached, but in
order to try to turn
that around I think,
the one way that
I think you can do that is
to keep our word
that when we said we
were going to lift
the sanctions that we were going to
be able to do that, and I thought
that
was the strongest way that I could
say to my team in the White
House and 
to my military, who really wanted
to pull the trigger on Iran, and
every country in the world
wanted to
pull the trigger on Iran
for the same reason
that I wanted them to pull the
trigger and we had a president
who wanted them to pull the
trigger and go to war. I thought
that was a good way to say
to them, let's follow through
with what we said
we were going to do
and follow through
with those commitments
and the easiest way
to pull back on them
is to say to them, look,
you want to see the Iranian
people suffer,
I agree with you, we should
make sure they suffer as long
as the nuclear deal
is in place
but I'm not going to abandon
our commitments to the people
of Iran because then I would be 
putting my people at risk
in the region and
the world and I wouldn't
do that, I didn't do that
and so, and I said, look, if
I pull back on my end
we won't do that,
if we try to renegotiate
I don't think that that
is wise for us to
try to make the deal
better because
they don't want a better deal,
they just want to make
the nuclear deal work,
they don't care if we continue
sanctions
but I would have to have
a very strong reason to do that,
not just some technical reasons,
or technical 
excuses that we didn't
build the nuclear
power plant, we did
build the nuclear
power plant but
we stopped because
they weren't in compliance,
and that was going to be
hard to defend. That is not
a good reason to
to pull out of a deal
that was good for
the region.
Thank you so much. Let's go
to more questions. What are your
thoughts on the 
truce in effect, there have been
no new significant 
violations
noted in Afghanistan.
Thank you very much.
Good afternoon, David
Good afternoon, Tom.
So your answer to Tom's question
is what you always say about the
truce and 
your hopes for it. 
How much have you 
seen it in action, 
especially here in Afghanistan?
Yes, I have seen 
it in action. We see
a lot of it,
the truce is actually,
it's in the 
tactics and operations plan
for security forces.
And they are doing
an extraordinary job.
We are
losing about one thousand
American lives in 
every eight and a half weeks,
and so, 
we're killing a lot of people
in Afghanistan.
And I have seen 
troops in the field, as I 
mentioned in the remarks
yesterday and I watched
the ceremony today with the
president, they have a tremendous
courage and 
bravery in the field
and I'll leave it at that.
Thank you, sir. Thanks
Mr. President.
I'm not going to do 
a deep dive on Iran,
but as you consider your 
options moving forward,
what would you say 
to those Democrats who argue
that these are really your
own, your son, son-in-law's,
Bolton's foreign policy 
in action?
And what would you say
to the American people that 
when you're making 
policy decisions, 
do you weigh 
all your options?
Well, we weigh all our options,
it's a
great question. You have seen
from the first day
that I was running for 
president, you know,
I was doing a debate
in Des Moines, Iowa, and I stood
up, we had a break, 
a break, I went to 
the microphone,
and I said, one of the things
we have to do to keep 
America safe is 
we have to stop the 
Islamic state
of Iraq and Syria from creating
a terror wave that could end up
destroying Europe and
threatening our own safety.
And the moderator said, 
David, what do you
mean by that, and 
I said we're not going
to be able to do that unless
I'm President of the United
States.
So it's always been one of my
mottoes. I have always felt
that
it was very, very important
to confront the
threat from the Islamic
extremists, and
that's what I'm doing.
I'll keep you safe.
There's
one other issue, 
that just came up
because as you know,
I was in the Rose Garden
announcing the, announcing 
the Iran
nuclear deal,
and some reporters, 
as you're talking about
there were people in the
Trump administration, 
some were speaking before
the deal was reached. 
Just one other thing,
you said you were
fighting terror. 
Iran is not your enemy.
And then they used that 
against you, right?
The other side says, he says
something
they can use against him, 
saying the Iran
nuclear deal does
not get rid of their 
nuclear weapons program,
that they are
developing, for example.
Where are they
developing their nuclear 
weapons, in their
secret, buried 
underground facility?
Yes. But Iran is not my enemy.
So it's always been one of my
mottoes and always will be.
No, that's right.
(laughter)
Can I finish, please?
Yes.
Okay. And lastly,
in the Rose Garden you spoke
to the families of
the victims of 9/11.
Do you think
you need to do more 
in that regard or 
should we stop asking 
for people to speak 
at every event?
Well,
I don't know if
it's more, I think it's a 
good question to, to ask,
and I wanted to answer
it as respectfully 
and specifically as I
could and as accurately as
I could because 
it's just the
right thing to do,
as I said in the 
speech.
I spent the better part
of the day yesterday
meeting and 
talking to the families 
of 9/11 victims 
who are members of
the armed services. 
It's a very sensitive
issue for them.
And so, I was really,
I want to thank them for
coming and sitting in the
audience, but I have 
one little question, 
if you will, just as a courtesy.
The president has 
in the past expressed
interest in 
bringing the remains 
of Osama bin Laden home.
Can you speak a 
little bit more about
what you might think
of that idea, if you would?
Well, you know I
have to do the right
thing, I think.
I have to do the right thing.
That's the president,
that's me.
Now, I don't really want
to get into a political game,
I just want to be
honest and open and do
the right thing,
and that's what I did.
When I was in New York, 
I made a promise 
to the people of New York
and the victims of 9/11, 
that I was going to go after
Al-Qaeda, as
many people know.
You probably read this 
a little
bit but I said I was
going to go after Al-Qaeda,
but Al-Qaeda 
and Al-Qaeda is not
the same as Iran,
and the reason I
said that is that Iran
has not been 
doing what they
have been accused 
of doing, it's not like
Al-Qaeda. 
There's another one.
There's
another one of the
terrorists.
Now, I don't know if I 
have the president's
approval, or he's had
the approval of the
national security 
staff, for that,
but we're going 
to have to find 
a way to do it.
I don't want to say more 
than I</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:17
