The TSS is an absolute monster in one-on-one duels, especially with the upgraded “Stealth” strategy. It’s a great way to catch people off guard and make them regret not being able to outrun you. It’s just a shame the original game didn’t introduce it first.

Other than sluggish gameplay, the other downside of the original Super Star Soccer is the lack of music. When you take out the soundtrack that plays in the menu, you only have the sounds of a referee blowing his whistle and whistling players giving each other shit (see what I did there? The developers are still pissed about FIFA). Thankfully it was one of the few complaints the team was able to fix with an update.

The first thing they fixed was the poor audio. Now with customizable teams, they added music! They also improved the animations and made the menus a little cleaner. On top of that they’ve added new goal celebrations, updated the kits and released a brand new training mode. It’s also a good idea to check out the FIFA 2016 DLC as they got most of the missing features back. FIFA 2016 Superstars Edition also brings back player ratings and in-game commentary. In fact, all you need to know about both of them are in this video:

It’s safe to say that the team who made SS and SSSE did a good job. It’s a shame that SSSE has a few minor issues. The one I have is making FIFA 2016 more of a game for people who loved SS instead of introducing them to this franchise. That said, SSSE is more than just an update of SS. It’s its own great version of Super Star Soccer. The only version of Super Star Soccer that isn’t worth your time is the first one, Super Star Soccer.

In conclusion: If you want to experience the best of FIFA, the best way is to buy FIFA. There’s no point in going down this rabbit hole as you’re only going to encounter annoying bugs, sluggish gameplay and a lack of depth. I can only imagine the original game must have been horrible, but hopefully you have better luck than me.

However, if you’re looking for a game in the genre, you have the third most popular football game out. That’s all thanks to Super Star Soccer. As long as you want to experience what the PS1 classics have to offer and don’t mind a few bugs here and there, give Super Star Soccer a try! Just don’t expect it to hold a candle to the classics.

For me, I’ll stick with FIFA. And Super Star Soccer.
