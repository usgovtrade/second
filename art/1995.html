Testimonials

Dear Mike & Emma,

I can't tell you how impressed we were with your organisation. The venue was perfect, the service we received from yourselves, especially from Emma was faultless. Not only that but you both were extremely accommodating throughout the whole process and gave us the confidence to go for it! There's no doubt in our mind that we would like to do business again with yourselves.

If you're not sure if you want your event catered for then please do not hesitate to ask for information as we will always be more than happy to help.

Thanks again for everything.

Laura

“I would just like to thank you all for the fantastic job you did at my daughter's wedding on Saturday. You guys were great.

Everything from setting up the day prior to the ceremony through to the final clean up after the speeches. You were flexible with the changing times so many times we had no idea how it would come together. You were with us the whole way. It was great to see a crew like yourselves which was nice and friendly. Not to mention professional and polite to everyone. We will recommend your services to all our friends who are having events. All in all it was a fantastic job well done, I couldn't have been happier and we will definitely be back.”

Mr & Mrs Taylor, East Lothian, September 2015

"Firstly a big thank you for the wonderful job you did on Sunday. You worked so hard to ensure the event went ahead for our daughter's wedding. We're so impressed at how you dealt with the many issues, both yours and ours and your ability to get the job done despite the weather. The food was amazing and we received many compliments from our guests about your catering. Thank you again for all your hard work on the day."

Jane & Stewart, Perth, January 2014

"Mike, I just wanted to thank you again for the work your team did at my wedding. On the day all went well. I didn't expect it to though, as from the moment we booked them in until the moment the cake was cut, they were extremely accommodating. Many thanks and regards."

Mr & Mrs Cairney, North Wales, August 2013

“Hi Mike & Mark,

Just a quick note to say thank you to you both for making the wedding so stress free for us, we couldn't have imagined a better service from a catering company. Everyone commented how tasty the food was and our guests are still talking about it now, nearly 2 weeks later.

Would recommend you both highly to anyone and I'll look forward to working with you again soon in the future”.

Mr & Mrs Watson, March 2014

“Thank you Mike and team for all your hard work and attention to detail! We were delighted with the meal service, and would have no hesitation in recommending your company to others.”

“Mike and his team provided a superb catering service at a special request for a dinner party. The team are friendly, the food excellent and the service second to none. I will certainly be using them in future and would recommend you guys to anyone.”

Mr & Mrs Hirst, Northampton, December 2012

“A very big thank you to all at Spoiled Brides. When we first contacted you about the event we were really apprehensive about having a buffet catered, however when it came to the day we were very happy with the service provided and also found our guests commented on how tasty it was. A job well done!”

Mrs & Mrs McMillan, March 2014

“Mike and his team have served drinks and food at several parties here and I would say there is not one more professional or friendly than Mike. He has a great personality and very easy to work with.”

Mr & Mrs McBride, September 2014

“Just a short note to thank you Mike & the team for the fantastic job they did on our birthday. Everyone commented on how good the service was, from the start when we met with you, through to getting ready on the day, the service was faultless. You were very prompt in your response to phone calls and emails so it was a real pleasure to work with you. Please pass on my thanks to Emma for being such a great hostess at the evening event! We had many compliments from our guests, especially the food! The meal selection was delicious and was enjoyed by all. Thank you Mike for the memories that you have created and hope to work with you again.”

Mr & Mrs H, May 2014

“Firstly we wanted to say thank you for all of your hard work at our daughter's wedding. Many of the guests had nothing but praise for the service that you provided and you were always on hand to help solve any issues which arose. Not to mention some of the fantastic food that was prepared! This was a big job for you and Emma, so well done! Also we would like to thank Emma for being so helpful and going that extra mile on the day, you really make the difference! And for the record, you will be making my next party!!”

Mr & Mrs H, May 2014

“Mike and the Spoilt Brides Team have done a wonderful job at our recent party. Our guests were amazed at the variety of food that was on offer. Some of them have said that it was the best selection they have had at any party. Many commented on how prompt the service was, we had no delays to our food or drink with the help of the Waitress and even the staff were able to recommend and give advice to our guests on how to enjoy the event to its fullest. This is our second event we have booked with you guys and will certainly continue to recommend you to others</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:49
