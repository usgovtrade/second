The second "book" titled "Merry Go Round Book of Tales" (later "Merry Christmas Book of Tales") was a series of 10-15 page short stories that ran from September 10, 1961 to December 5, 1968. 

Kentucky Fried Comics was a book series that appeared in the early 1980s. It consisted of reprints of Larson's strips from the early 1940s through the early 1950s. Kentuck's Fried Comics also served as an occasional source of inspiration for Larson's own stories. 

From 1989 to 1995, Kentucky Fried Comics had reprints of Larson's strips from the 1930s through the 1940s. The most recent book reprints his 1950s-era comics.

In 2005, a new book was published by Pendulum Press of Atlanta, Georgia. This new book consisted of all Larson's Christmas stories in one volume.

Awards 
His stories were the basis for one of the first LPs to win a Grammy, KFC's The Adventures of Furry Potter and His Pals in 1964.  Its success was primarily due to the fact that the album was packaged with a coloring book that came with a free pencil and "potato head" (the face of a jack-o'-lantern cutout) for people to color.
