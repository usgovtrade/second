And, “My Father’s Hands” brings us back to John’s roots with songs of his own father and how he prepared for his death.

As I said earlier, John has toured around America this year, with a new show that included many new songs that were written especially for this show. All of his music is available on iTunes and Amazon, in MP3 and CD formats. You can check him out on Facebook and YouTube.

Hi Gerry, I wanted to stop by and share some nice feedback on my latest album - "Let the Light In" and your article from last month. Your reviews are much appreciated - and you are doing a great job on this blog. You certainly have talent! This album has been on iTunes for the last month and I thank you for the well deserved kind words. I am hoping that some of these reviews will help to get it exposed to more fans. My album definitely has an inspirational and positive message that is appropriate for all ages. I feel that "Let the Light In" will resonate with everyone who listens. Take care and God bless!

I was thinking about how amazing people’s talents are and how God works in unique ways when I read this email from a fellow author: I was recently a guest on a national radio show, on American Family Radio, to promote my new book entitled “God’s Great Love Story,” a book that focuses on the love God had for us before we even knew Him! How cool is that? My guest was Pastor John D’Angelo and he interviewed me and then he interviewed Michael Hedges from The Burning Season podcast. Then, it was my turn to talk about my book! It was awesome to share about God’s love and our sinful condition, and it was fun to talk to an audience on the radio. Listen to this interview here:https://www.burningseasonpodcast.com/burning-season-1-22-12-john-dangelo/I have been in the music ministry for over 30 years and was singing with a wonderful group when God tapped me on the shoulder to go solo. That is when I felt I truly became aware of God’s Word. God had been calling me to minister to people the same way He ministered to me. I am so thankful God gave me that ability. I am blessed and honored to speak at worship events and speak to my heart with the Word of God. Thanks for the inspiration and I hope I get a chance to be on your show sometime.
