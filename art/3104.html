This one is hard.

I think it’s hard for anyone to take someone's advice if you don’t agree with them. To me this is like being your own worst enemy and you are constantly being told to do things that will make you miserable or worse yet your loved ones will not be there for you. I like reading your perspective. There are too many people in the world and we all should try and give a piece of advice and not feel bad for the bad one. It’s a free country. Even if it’s not a good advice.

The point you are making is true. We see it daily on all social media sites where people are giving advice to get you a guy. But I also see comments going the other way too. We have to just find that happy medium. Someone who is honest with what they know but realistic.

I can do this!

Well…I can try! lol. I think we can’t all do this if we give advice. Every person is different. And depending on the situation, you might not need advise.

I like this a lot of it. And especially the second one because I feel we, as women, want to tell other women how to treat men. How to be strong. What to expect from men. But, we forget that we are the same as men and expect the same things in return. And it doesn’t work that way. We are also emotional. We feel things deeply. And this part is so true to me and often what I want to say but don’t because I’m not getting paid by you guys for what I think. I just want to be able to give my opinion and not feel obligated to change how I do things and how I look at things and the way I live my life just because you want me to be like some celebrity or look a certain way. Because, as I said before, I am a woman and I am living life. No apologies.

I agree with this 100%. It’s not that you were raised the way you were. It’s the people that are taking advantage of you. I see this all the time. Especially with my young nieces. Just because a man is 25, and he thinks he should be with a 24 year old does not mean he is cool with it. Just because some men are okay with the situation does not mean that a woman should do the same. We should not have to play the game and then make sure that our emotions are not hurt. It’s not fair. And to me that’s a way of manipulation. It may not be the same to every woman, but it is in the case of the ones I see.

Why did no one ever tell you that it was normal for women to stay in bad relationships so they would be able to get something from you? Why did no one ever tell you that the reason why your relationship turned into something in the first place was because you never told him you didn’t like it?

My Dad, my friend, my Mom, my cousins, my sister, and others would always tell me that I shouldn’t stay with my ex. I would always get defensive. I told myself that my family was not going to raise me, they didn’t know. I went into that relationship thinking I would give him a chance. But it was so deep rooted that I didn’t notice it because it was always one of those excuses. My Mom tried to tell me this, my friend tried to tell me this, but they couldn’t reach me. I’m glad you could.

You’re not telling us anything we don’t already know. The world works that way. We should stop the “but we have never had a problem before” bullshit. We all knew that shit coming and went on with our life anyway. Why? Because we always thought people knew what they were doing.

We don’t.

A man might know what they are doing. But that doesn’t mean a woman should stay. Or to even try. We might have done it before and came out fine, but it doesn’t mean we have to do it again. I know a lot of women who stay with men who have said many, many, many times, “I don’t want to be with you”. But they stay with these men out of “necessity” (you know, that thing that makes a man feel like he’s a man…). Well I’m sorry. I don’t give a shit about your needs. If I feel like staying with you, then that’s what I’m going to do.

The same goes with the women who stay with men they don’t love just for the relationship, the sex, and the sense of stability. Who wants to be with someone they don’t love for any reason other than those three? And, yes, I say that from the woman’s perspective. We want to be loved and someone to feel comfortable with. But you can be comfortable in a home that you are not comfortable in. It’s not like you have to marry this person. You don’t. Or if you do, it should be for something good not because you don’t have any money.

And those are the women who stay longer because they don’t know any better. Or they just accept it, so whatever. And that’s okay. That’s something they have to work out on their own. They shouldn’t look to us to save them from these type of relationships or “bad” men.

The whole thing about men “falling for women who aren’t ‘malleable'” is ridiculous. I’m sorry. Are we not women? If men can fall in love with anything, why can’t a woman? Sure they’re vulnerable to it, but so are we. Some of us are way more vulnerable than others, but we do it anyway. It happens every day.

The men who are being with women out of pity, for stability, for marriage, for the right reason… Those are the men who stay, and we’re okay with it. Why? Because that’s what we do. That’s what we wanted. And we see that he loves us, and so we want to show that love back. But it’s not the love that we’re in if we’re in it for the right reason. That’s just not how it works.

I like this a lot because like you said before, I have to be careful not to become this “fake girlfriend” for a guy who I like. I can’t do that because I wouldn’t be doing what I do. It’s hard.

You know what? I couldn’t agree with this more. Some people get the most upset when you criticize the men because it hurts them. They say they’re okay with the breakups, they don’t see a problem with it. And if I don’t agree with them, they get mad.

You have to remember something. That girl who gets mad at your opinion may just be saying it in order to hurt your feelings. You know, just because a man tells a woman something, she doesn’t have to believe it. She may not be being told the truth either. Why not just give her a chance to see things from your point of view? You don’t have to tell her that she’s a dumb bitch if you don’t feel that way. Who’s looking out for you? Who is protecting you? Who is being honest with you? A lot of women are not like you. They’ll speak out against you and give you a bad name, but then don’t say a word about their lies, deceit, and disrespectful acts. They don’t care about you. And I don’t care what you do or what you say to them, but I don’t expect you to like them just because you have nothing to lose. I know a lot of women who have gotten pissed when you criticized them or said what you thought. They don’t want to hear that. But they don’t tell you no less than 15 different ways how wrong you are, but when the shoe’s on the other foot they take what you say to them as if they are right all of the time and they are trying to hurt your feelings. If you really think about it, they’re just like your ex.

That kind of goes into the last part about some women never being in a relationship with someone who doesn’t make them feel like</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:12
