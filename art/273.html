everyone's singing along". 
The only
example of the band stopping in the movie was the song "You Give Love a Bad
Name". For the rest of the songs I think they were just practicing.

They could have been singing "Love, love" at the very end as you can see in the 
beginning. If I recall correctly the scene with the "guitarists"
was in the middle of the movie.

A:

The band members weren't actually singing in the subway station, but they played for the fans that had gathered at the station when the band was playing in New York. The audience was singing along with the lyrics of the song. It would have made a huge scene for the band to actually have to stop playing to get people to be quiet and sing along. At least I think that's how it was handled in the film.

A:

The film, you can see, is not about a band and their fans in general, but about one band that's popular among the fans.  While it's true, they are in a subway station and some fans were around, most of the movie was shot in LA, while it might have been more typical of New York.  The band would have had to stop playing for a long period, if a full stadium of people were to sing along at the end, and even then I'd have said that even the least of them would at least have stopped singing for a couple of seconds.

A:

There are a number of references to the fact that they stopped playing after that. The band did a concert just a few hours prior to the scene, and while there wasn't any formal 'welcome back' performance as the video shows, at the very least they had a couple of songs left in them, but the movie would have shown the actual concert. After all, if you're going to have them sing in that song at all, you'd need to have them sing as an audience, or (more likely) have them continue after the concert in order to establish the sound that plays over the title credits.
On the other hand, what's shown at the beginning of the film was a small performance. While it might have had audience members (presumably friends/family of the band/staff), there simply wasn't enough to show a whole crowd. And as a matter of pure logistics, no one band that I know of plays in a subway station.

In any case, this is yet another example of some very basic common sense being overlooked by those who aren't intimately familiar with the source.

While I generally agree with DazeOfDreams in terms of the nature of the song (which would be an odd choice for an NYC set - it's a band from New Jersey), the fact that they stopped after doing a full performance doesn't seem particularly inconsistent with the rest of the movie, given its New York focus. In the NYC music scene (and particularly among the hard rock sub-genre), there are a large number of bands that perform not just the best-known and most well-loved songs of others, but also their own songs (whether original or covers) over a period of at least 2 hours, which is what they did in the film.

A:

I don't know if this is the case with any of the other movies, but in the final Harry Potter movie, the band was performing "Weasley Is Our King" when the Weasley twins approached and broke the fourth wall. (The song can be heard clearly if you fast-forward to 1:27:08 in the clip.) At the end of the song they say, "Nice! We'll take it from here!" (1:28:08). So the music stopped, it just so happened that a group of young fans started clapping to the rhythm, and then they started talking. I haven't found anything saying that they were clapping or the singing was pre-recorded.
I remember thinking that the music playing at the end was from the actual concerts the band had played for a couple weeks prior to the scene, and I remember wondering if they would have stopped playing at that moment in the concerts, too.

From the official HP wiki

The group's manager, Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), walks through the school with a book she has obtained at the library, and when one of the band members asks "What is it?", she responds, "My great-grandfather's autobiography. It's about how the family survived the war." This particular volume belongs to Ginny's cousin, Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy), who is currently a member of the band.

That would mean they were indeed still playing the song after Harry Potter came up to them, and they were still going to play it until Ginny told them "We'll take it from here!"
However, it is possible that Fleur has been using it to read at that time (see the lyrics on the wiki page).
Either way, it is clearly a reference to the actual band, not a couple random fans just going with the flow.

"The film opens with the Weasley Family playing to a large audience at a concert in King's Cross Station. While most of the concert takes place in the background, there are occasions where the band stops and the audience begins to sing along with the song, including the final moments of "You Give Love A Bad Name", the penultimate track on Weezer's "Green Album", where band and fans (including the Weasley family members) are singing to the song while being serenaded by fireworks."
