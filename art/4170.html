a forested shoreline, about one mile long and just over two miles wide.
Water levels are controlled by a regulator, and there is no water exchange with
the ocean; the lake is quite isolated.

An unnamed bay on the east side of the lake near its outlet.
This bay can be viewed from a small hilltop with a viewpoint
at its southern end, and a boardwalk that meanders around
its eastern shoreline. A large area of this bay is a
protected State preserve, with views of both the bay
and the Lake.

Lake Merritt, once a saltwater lagoon for grazing cows and gardens,
where the city center now stands, and later a shipbuilding and boat-building
hub, with a large boat builder’s colony. Today the Lake is still in an artificial
basin and not a natural lake. It’s a lakelet, really, but with most of its
water going into the San Francisco Bay, not the Pacific Ocean. A fairly large
and deep basin. We’ve been unable to view it; we have not yet been able to find
a good vantage point from which to photograph it.

The San Francisco Bay, the third largest bay in the world.
This bay is really a complex of waterways, channels, straits,
narrow passages and islands stretching about 250 miles
from the Golden Gate in the north to the Golden Horn in the
south. Many of the cities and towns of California are
located on the shores of the bay and its channels and
tributaries. About 95 percent of the Bay’s volume of
water comes from the Pacific, with the remaining 5 percent
coming from the Sacramento River. The large freshwater
portion of the Bay, known as the Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta, empties about 150,000 acre-feet of water into
the bay. Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers also drain
the north and south respectively. The Sacramento River
at its mouth ends up in Suisun Bay, about two miles from
San Francisco. To the south of the San Francisco peninsula,
the bay’s saltwater portion is very shallow and narrow,
making it easy for ships to enter its mouth at the Golden
Gate. The bay is bordered on the west by Marin County,
then the counties of San Francisco, San Mateo and
Alameda, and finally by Contra Costa County. Most of
the Bay’s shoreline is highly urbanized, with little of its
eastern shore area, mostly in the Richmond and Oakland
areas, protected, or even public. For example, much of the
Birds Point Area is a protected park; there is also a state
park just south of it.

A small, fairly high island at the north end of the Bay with trails.
This island is part of Alcatraz Island Recreation Area,
which also includes Alcatraz Island itself and a number
of other small islands and reefs located just offshore,
all of them under the jurisdiction of the federal
government. For a couple of weeks each year in May, the
island and reefs are open to the public for hiking. There
is an entrance fee for the weekday tours, and you must
register for the tours to gain access to the island. The
Alcatraz Island Visitors Center provides an overview of
the island and is also the starting point for boat tours
to Alcatraz and for the various trails on the island.

Sacramento River, the largest river in California, draining a large
portion of northern California, and contributing some water to
the San Francisco Bay. Although the Sacramento River is dammed
to control the water level of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River
Delta, most of it still drains to the San Francisco Bay via
Mokelumne and Cosumnes rivers, via Pardee Creek, an estuary and
tributary of the Sacramento. The Sacramento River’s headwaters
are in the Trinity Mountains. There are several dams along its
length, including the Folsom dam and the Anderson–Knox dams,
which form the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The river
empties into Suisun Bay near Benicia. There are a number of water
reclamation facilities along the river, including the Keswick and
Sutter Buttes water reclamation facilities.

A dammed portion of the Sacramento River at the west end of Folsom Lake.
This area is a part of the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area.
The Folsom Lake Recreation Area stretches about two miles along
the north bank of the Sacramento River, bordered on the west by
the Sierra Nevada mountains. A large portion of the recreation
area is owned and managed by the Department of Water Resources.
Folsom Lake (named for John Bidwell, who first established it as
a diversion dam in 1849) is a large artificial body of water.
It is the result of three dams that impound the Sacramento
River. The Sacramento Valley Water Conveyance Project of
the late 1950s and 1960s, was part of a major series of projects
designed to bring more water from Northern California into
Southern California. (The Central Valley Project eventually
supplied more than half the fresh water to southern California,
including the vast Imperial Valley and other agriculture-heavy
areas, and the Los Angeles River watershed.)

A portion of the original Sacramento River where it empties into the
Suisun Bay. The Suisun Bay is about two miles wide at the mouth.
This section of river is lined with sloughs and wetlands, and
tends to be narrow and shallow, although this is a recent
condition. It used to be a larger river, with natural meanders
and levees for most of its length.

Suisun Bay is a north-to-south estuary where the Sacramento River and
the Carquinez Strait meet. The Suisun Bay project is the longest of
the San Francisco Bay Area water supply projects. It brings waters
into San Francisco Bay from a number of tributaries, including
the Sacramento River, and the north and south forks of the
San Joaquin River, and the Sacramento and San Joaquin
River Delta water system. The canal and canalized rivers feed
water to the San Francisco Bay through Suisun Slough, through
a canal that runs from Suisun Bay to Bodega Bay, into
the Santa Clara Valley and eventually to San Francisco.
San Francisco Bay is fed by Suisun Bay, as well as by
the San Francisco Slough, Carquinez Strait and a number
of other lesser rivers.

The Fremont Powerplant that supplies energy for the city of
Fremont.
This dam is named after Thomas Fremont who was a businessman
and one-time California governor. The dam is also the home to
the Sacramento State Fish Hatchery, which releases approximately
40,000 salmon smolts into the river each year. To get to the
hatchery, you must first get to the dam. The dam has a small
attraction park which features various displays of the dam,
fish, wildlife and some of the local plant life. There is also
a restaurant in the park, a miniature railway, an amusement
park and a children’s playground.

A state wildlife management area around the south shore of the
San Francisco Bay near the Point Pinole Marina. This area
protects some of the remaining old growth redwood forest in
the San Francisco Bay Area. Point Pinole is a peninsula
that juts into the Bay and marks the eastern point of the
San Francisco Bay. Some of the main attractions at Point
Pinole are the Point Pinole Plaza, Alcatraz lighthouse,
the Seacrest fishing pier and a large community recreation
center for local residents.

An old concrete bridge spanning the Sacramento River over a railroad
trestle just south of where the river empties into Suisun Bay.
Another crossing, carrying trains, was constructed in 1913
and dismantled in 1992. An abutment was rebuilt on the new
bridge, but the old bridge was not removed. It is now the
sole remaining bridge spanning the Sacramento River, that is
in decent condition.

A portion of Suisun Bay north of the Napa-Fairfield-Vacaville
Bridge at the north end of Suisun Bay. The Sacramento River
and the Napa-Fairfield-Vacaville Bridge form Suisun Bay,
which stretches from Suisun Bay up to San Pablo Bay. The
bay is about two miles wide at its mouth, and about 3.6
miles wide at the area we visited. It was dredged for a
new bridge in 2003, which opened for use in 2005. We were
unable to visit the new bridge, so we</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:29
