Vintage Cork Festival

Gonville Hotel, Cork, June 29-30

Get yourself some very good quality clothes and accessories for Christmas. This is a great chance to save on big brand name brands such as Hugo Boss, Gucci, and Giorgio Armani.

There’s plenty of fantastic entertainment too. There’s a concert by the incredible Ryle’n Rae. They’re known for their huge sets and massive productions.

That’s just the start of a busy festival. There’s a fashion show, a dog show, a vintage fashion extravaganza and live music too. So take part in a fashion show, a dog show, and a vintage fashion extravaganza.

This was a very good weekend for music in the city centre. It’s very different to what we’re used to at the beginning of June. There’s an obvious contrast in the quality of music but for that reason, they’re all pretty brilliant.

The quality of music this weekend is pretty brilliant. (Oliver Clarke)

Nuit Blanche

Artists’ Spaces at the Cork Opera House, June 30-July 1

You’re going to find something for you at Nuit Blanche, which runs from June 30th to July 1st. There are 160 installations spread around ten different venues. It’s the first time in the city centre for this festival.

This isn’t your usual festival. I’ve seen some of the work there and it’s very high quality. It’s a more artistic way of enjoying the city.

Cork has three of the things that make up a great festival. Beautiful architecture, great food, and beautiful people. This is an event not to miss. It’s free, it’s open from 6pm on June 30th and from 10am on July 1st, and it runs until 7pm each day.

Fantastika

Liam Leahy Arts Centre, July 1-2

The weekend festival is a very good alternative to the usual music at the Grand Social. The lineup is really strong. There are a lot of indie and punk artists featured and it’s a great opportunity to see some of the best in music.

One good thing is the atmosphere. It’s a bit different from the usual concert at the Grand Social. This is an important weekend for Fantastika. If you’re a fan of underground music, I would seriously recommend you check it out.

There’s a lot of great music at Fantastika. (Sean Scully)

A weekend away in a fantastic location

The Bandon House Hotel in beautiful Bandon, Co. Cork, is set in a stunning coastal village. You can’t get much better than this. It’s a four-star, four-star rated luxury hotel that has its own swimming pool, gym, jacuzzi and sauna. It’s only a short drive from Cork city.

You can’t get much better than this. (Villas of Distinction)

Bandon House Hotel has been family run for four generations. It’s owned by the fourth generation and managed by the fifth generation. I know they must be pretty proud of that. It’s a great name to bring family history.

As with all Villas of Distinction properties, they go through a strict selection procedure to make sure that there’s a very good mix of people who are coming there and how they live. The guests are very happy here.

I’ve been to Bandon House a few times over the years. It has its own swimming pool, gym, jacuzzi and sauna. It’s right next door to Bandon Beach, which is really good.

There’s an Italian restaurant downstairs. It’s called Bella Luna and it was highly recommended to me by people in Cork city. The food is really good. The chef does an amazing job. They’re very big on home-made pasta.

You should go to the dining room at Bandon House Hotel at some point for a great meal. (Villas of Distinction)

If you think of Bandon as being part of the west of Ireland, then you get a completely different impression of the place. It’s a quiet little town that isn’t really used to tourists, except for the Irish and the Irish abroad.

It’s great to see it being so successful. There’s nothing else like it. It’s a great place for a weekend away.
