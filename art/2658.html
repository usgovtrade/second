If you are single, here's one more reason to head to the beach this summer: the weather.

In a new report from the Associated Press, beachfronts around the country are seeing a record number of single males seeking out their own space.

"We're seeing a spike in single men at the beach over the past year," Sandy Oka Donohue, a spokeswoman for The Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., told the news source. "It might be the economy. And with the economy the way it is, it's just a very busy time."

Oka Donohue also told ABC News the Breakers are doing a great job of providing them with space. "We have really taken the time to understand what they want," she said. "There's always the need to have someplace where people can go and recharge and look out and think and breathe."

But, of course, it's not as easy as it sounds.

Oka Donohue said she has gotten comments from women who don't like that men are "hogging" the beach, "but I don't get any negative feedback from our guests," she added.

"There's no problem with sharing the beach," Oka Donohue said. "I think the beach has been there for the public to enjoy. We're not a private beach. We've never felt like it was ours."

She noted the difference in what men want compared to women.

"Guys have a specific thing: they want the space and the privacy," she said. "They want to have a seat that they can't be crowded out of, and we try to find spaces for that. Guys are a little more picky."

Oka Donohue also said that since men don't get into the water, there is less of a problem than if they were in the water. "Men have never been huge fans of water, but they do like to sit by the pool," she said.

The Breakers said it hasn't seen a jump in single men this summer, but the AP reported that it has seen an increase in younger single men, ages 18-to-30, in the past year.

"Some women don't like the situation," John Osta, general manager at the Surf Rider resort in Florida, told AP. "Guys go from bikinis to boxers and back again and that is hard for some women to deal with. We don't want to do anything to disrespect the women."

Surf Rider has a policy, however, that requires all guests to wear swimsuits. "This is an equal-opportunity business," Osta said.

One couple, he said, recently made a booking only to have their wedding the next day. He said they have seen a lot of weddings as well.

Oka Donohue said men usually aren't as worried about meeting women as other people are and they don't worry about the stigma that comes with sitting on the beach alone. "It's like I have the right to do this on my own," she said. "It's their own personal space."

Oka Donohue said she thinks the media has focused on beaches around cities because the population is larger, "so you might see more people on a beach." But she said that in New York and Los Angeles, "there's a lot of space."

Osta said single men are "not only getting more comfortable going to the beach, they're seeing the value in it and embracing it."

"A couple of years ago, it was a younger generation of guys who would have rather been at a rooftop bar or club in the city," he said. "Now it's just the natural progression of being out at the beach or by the pool."

And Oka Donohue said the increase in male visitors is "like a breath of fresh air."

"Sometimes you get frustrated when it's really busy, but it does work out to your benefit," she said. "We have an easier time with it. But if you're worried about sitting alone, we have plenty of chairs. Don't worry about it."

"It's really nice to see that you can go and have a vacation and have a good time."

Said Osta: "We never want to leave anybody out."

This summer, though, the beach might be the one place where single guys can find their happiness.

A study by Match.com, which says it has the largest user base of any dating site in the United States, found that single guys ages 34 to 49 were more open than women to dating online and were willing to pay for it.

"Men are starting to get fed up with the way that the dating landscape is today, where you have to spend a lot of time online and invest a lot of energy in looking for dates," Mandy Ginsberg, the head of Match.com's Matchmaking Experts, said. "They have come to the point where they've had enough. If they want a partner, they're not going to settle for less than that."

"A lot of men feel that they are giving away too much of their time to other people -- their friends and co-workers," Ginsberg added. "They want to choose who they have dates with. And on Match.com, you do."

Ginsberg said there has been a "cultural shift" and added that if you are not willing to move beyond the first date and meet someone's family or friends, that is an immediate turn-off.

Meanwhile, studies show that people who are looking for a long-term relationship are not comfortable with online dating, but if they have to choose between someone they met online and a member of their friend's circle or family member, "70 percent of the time, they choose the person they know," according to Match.com.

And while Match.com is trying to offer more than just dates, there are those who are offering online dating counseling to help those who are a little shy or nervous when it comes to meeting up with someone for the first time.

And men are doing this, too.

Bachelor or Bachelorette Parties?

For the bride-to-be, there are plenty of things to consider.

How long have you been a member of the groom's family? Do they have an older daughter or son? Is it normal for the groom's family to throw a party? What would you like to do for the party? Is it a backyard barbeque or a dinner party? Are you bringing your parents or will you be spending time with the groom's family?

"This is all a question of how much communication happens between the groom and bride-to-be. And the longer the groom knows the bride-to-be, the more they can get her opinion on what she would like to do," Lynn M. Pfeffer, PhD, a clinical psychologist and author of "Choosing Mr. Right-for-Me," told the website Brides.com. "It's all communication."

The groom's mother "should be the one making all the final decisions about the party, but it's important to ask her about how it will be managed," she added. "Will it be large, like a wedding? Or small and intimate?"

The bride-to-be also needs to think about her priorities. "Does she care what the groom's family thinks of her? Do they need to approve of her in order for the relationship to work?" Pfeffer asked. "Does the groom really want to do something for the bride-to-be and not just to impress her? Does he want her to be happy?"

The wedding planner also needs to think about the party. "Do they want it to be fun, simple, laid back, or formal?" Pfeffer asked. "Will there be a buffet or a sit down dinner, will there be a band, will the food be catered or will it be homemade? Can the bride and groom set the mood or will it be driven by the groom's family?"

Finally, Pfeffer said the wedding planner should try to see if the bride is willing to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:51
