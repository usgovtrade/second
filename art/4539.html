It’s hard to get much more beautiful than being on the edge of a fairway.

It’s quiet. It’s dark. It’s peaceful.

We were all so, so lucky to be on the 18th hole at Augusta National. What a perfect way to end the day.

Bart Watson was the photographer for this particular shot. He captured it perfectly.

The fact that it was a “selfie” helped make it seem like we were even more a part of the process.

What a memory to treasure.

Here’s the complete list of golfers. I’ve separated them by sex. It was interesting how many of the first names were either male or female:

Bae Sang Choi (G)

Chris DiMarco (G)

James Furyk (G)

Greg Harmon (G)

Tim Herron (G)

Kevin Na (G)

Spencer Levin (G)

Billy Mayfair (G)

J. B. Holmes (G)

Curtis Luck (G)

Rocco Mediate (G)

Lee Janzen (G)

Kyle Stanley (G)

Mark Wilson (G)

Paul Goydos (G)

We walked through the course with our bags, but we also walked back to the clubhouse to say goodbye to my parents, Jim and Judy.

I am so glad I took the opportunity to say goodbye before heading back home.

I had some other shots of me walking down Magnolia Lane on the golf course. I took the time to look behind me.

Even though I was walking toward the 18th hole, I still managed to catch a good glimpse of the 13th hole.

This is actually one of the rare times that I have seen a view of the 13th hole. I was hoping to catch it again.

I wanted to share a little bit of lighthearted humor as I walked down Magnolia Lane. My husband wanted to wait to walk down Magnolia Lane with me and my parents until I showed them this picture.

I have another picture of me walking on Magnolia Lane… but I would have to walk all the way back to my friends’ house and that would be a real inconvenience.

I saw one empty seat for me to sit on after I left the party. I decided to sit on it.

I had a big smile on my face as I got to the front of the camera.

Finally, I saw my friends’ mom, Cathy, walking toward the front of the camera. I was thrilled. She was able to capture my smile in just the right spot.

The last thing I had to capture was this little gem, a sign that said “C’mon Get Happy!”

I had a great time on Sunday. We spent the day at the Masters Clubhouse at Augusta National.

It was nice and quiet. We watched the final hole of the tournament. We were able to see most of the players in the round when we walked by the clubhouse.

I’m just a big fan of golf and all the action it took to build it up to be a huge event that we all love watching.

All this golf business was a big treat for the three of us.

The weather was beautiful. We were so thankful to be at the Masters Clubhouse.

I know it won’t be long before the next Masters tournament. I’m looking forward to going again next year.

This will be a year that will be filled with golf, baseball, basketball, and football. So much fun!

There is so much to do and see during the Spring and Summer.

I’m already trying to get my tickets for the U.S. Open at Pinehurst. The weather should be perfect that week.

I’m not ready to put away my golf club just yet.

There is one event I will never miss though: the Masters!

Thanks again, Cathy, for capturing all of these beautiful pictures. There is nothing better than photographing a perfect day at the Masters.

Great pics!! Especially the one of the dog (you know the one I’m talking about), the one with your dad sitting next to him, and the one you were standing on one of the tees (but leaning way back)… I loved it.

When I read that you were at Augusta I hoped it was during the week of your conference… I have a Masters trip I have to think about in May/June and I would love to share it with you guys… not as nice as being in the house with you guys (but I would try to get there if there was room…), but still not bad!

I’ve played golf and a lot. I’ve never been to a golf tournament. It’s good to see the Masters and all the other tournaments you have mentioned. Golf is a good sport. Your picture of two people are in the Masters is a good one. Thank you for sharing.

I like your pic of the dog in the cart. He’s looking at the green. I’ve read about how difficult the golf course is. It looks like a beautiful place to golf. There’s lot of work to do before he was ready to play golf with you. You looked in great shape. Enjoyed your story and looking forward to seeing you soon. Nice work!

About the author

Hi, I'm April, the owner and main blogger here at The Game of Life. I'm slightly addicted to Pinterest and have been known to use it as a black book (it's the perfect place to store all the bits and bobs that I'm sure will come in useful at a later date, but for now they are just taking up space). I live with my husband in Adelaide, South Australia and work full time in finance. In my spare time I love to explore blogs and get inspired by all that is out there. My goal is to create a blog and hubs that inspire you, that help you get out and about in your own backyard and that maybe inspire you to get out and get creating. Thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy your visit!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:39
