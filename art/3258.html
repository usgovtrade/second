All right, so I'm going to break down what I love about this board game.
I think the biggest thing is the simplicity. It's so simple and easy.
You have a board that has a bunch of territories,
each with the name of an animal, and then you have cards that say to find a specific card.
Each card has a symbol on it to show if you win, you get points or you lose
and you win points if you have some of the same symbols on your animal card.
You can also add food or trade items to your board.
Now, I'm sure anyone who played this will know how this turns out.
Well, if you didn't, here's the thing.
There's a really long list of symbols on this card.
(pops)
So, it's basically like a jigsaw puzzle.
That's kind of like how it's all laid out, so you're going to have to look over every single card,
every single symbol on every single animal.
This is definitely one of those things where you can just look at one and say,
"Well, I don't want to get lost in the jumble of all of this."
It's going to take a really long time to really find out who's going to win here,
and as much as that's kind of cool, I don't really like having to put in the time
to find all the symbols on all the cards, it's just too time consuming.
It's honestly not that interesting.
(pops)
You might be curious about something.
Well, no one knows, you've gotta do the hard work to find the symbols, and that takes time.
It's honestly just a waste of time to me.
It's not the most interesting thing ever, honestly.
(pops)
Also, that's a thing that I noticed a lot of while I was playing this.
It's definitely not the most difficult to do.
But, I know there are people who aren't that good with spelling out words.
I get it, and maybe I'm one of them, but when I put in a word,
like a name or something, it would really take me like forever, and then I don't feel like I'm
putting in the same effort as everyone else.
I'd rather just go through and look through every single thing I have in my bag.
It's the same thing.
Another thing that I found really difficult is because of how many symbols there are,
I would find myself just losing my mind when I was trying to make sure I didn't miss anything.
Now, I know that this might be tough for some people.
But, if you're looking at this in kind of a more casual or more casual-
Let's say just kind of a more casual way to play,
I would not recommend this game, because this is definitely an intense game.
(pops)
My final complaint about this is that is just kind of time consuming,
and that's something you can kind of feel like you're wasting a lot of time.
And, you're trying to build that little empire, but you know you're really not getting much for your time.
I'm only going to be looking at one part of the cards.
You're looking for those symbols, but you don't get any money,
or at least I didn't, I didn't find any money.
It's really just like you're not gaining anything for your time spent here,
and it's really too much work for me to find those symbols on those cards.
It's kind of too much work to spend your time on this game and I don't find it fun at all.
Overall, I am kind of really disappointed with this game.
This is one of those things I don't like doing, but it takes so much time and effort
that it's kind of hard to justify, but I just was really bored by it, I really didn't find it fun.
Overall, it's not that fun to me.
It's a lot of work to find all those symbols, and I just didn't find it that fun.
All right guys, that was all for my videos about board games!
Let me know what you think of this, if you've played it before.
Let me know, if you have any recommendations about what you would love to see in the future.
Maybe let me know some of the games that you've tried out that were really good.
It'd be really nice to hear what games people have liked and what games they've actually liked.
Let me know down below in the comments.
I can't wait to hear what you think of this one.
I hope you guys enjoyed.
I hope you learned something from this video.
I hope you have fun playing board games.
I really hope that you found a game that you can play and you really enjoy.
Otherwise, it might just take a lot of time and it could just be more frustrating than anything.
I hope you have fun, and I hope you find some games that you can enjoy.
Make sure you are subscribed, so that you don't miss out on the next one.
I think the next video that I'm going to be doing will be an unboxing of a board game, but that might be
a while down the road.
It's always good to take a break from board games, so if you want to see what we have to play,
make sure to go back to the old game videos and scroll back.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be doing these though, I could just keep playing until I get sick of it.
I'm gonna keep doing them if you guys want me to keep doing them, but I'll be sure to let you know
how it all works out. I think this is definitely not a replacement for what you're used to.
But, it's good to know what other games are out there.
Otherwise, what are you looking for?
You know, sometimes people say that they don't want a more complicated game,
but sometimes they want something really simple.
Maybe I'll be doing more of these in the future if you guys want me to do more of these.
But, that's all for this video guys. I really hope you enjoyed this one.
It was long, but it was a lot of fun, I hope you enjoyed it.
If you have any questions or thoughts about board games, let me know down below.
Otherwise, make sure you check out the board game and let me know what you think of the videos.
See ya later, I'll see you in another video, bye!
