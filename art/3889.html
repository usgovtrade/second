'I'm Moving On' (written by Jimi Hendrix)

'Last Stop: San Diego' (written by Jimi Hendrix)

'Voodoo Chile' (written by Jimi Hendrix)

The song 'Voodoo Chile' (track three on the album) is an instrumental piece by Jimi Hendrix and the reason it comes after 'Voodoo Child (Slight Return)' on this list. The song opens with Hendrix playing some funky guitar chords. Then he screams in the microphone: 'Come on people, get crazy.' The song consists of a long version of the same riff, while Hendrix and Billy Cox play some heavy bongo drums. The chanting background singers in the song are very creepy. But, this song contains none of the funky or heavy guitar parts like other parts of the album. Hendrix's chanting is in reverse like in many other songs in the album, as if he's going backwards in his life and he doesn't know what to do.

The instrumental 'Machine Gun' comes next and it's one of the greatest moments in this album. Jimi Hendrix's guitar work is out of this world. It is simply the best guitar part in this album and perhaps in the entire Jimi Hendrix's catalog. The song is about a man in a car shooting at different people. The song has a hard and powerful sound. It's a long instrumental that features guitar and drums solos. However, it's very short. After it is 'Purple Haze', which is a Jimi Hendrix song that came first on his second album, called _Axis: Bold As Love_.

_The Beatles' George Harrison: The Beatles' George Harrison_ was a book written by Martin Williams and published by William Collins publishing. It was first published in 1973. The next song is the last track of the album, called 'The Stones' and it's also another Jimi Hendrix instrumental. It's a long riff and Hendrix plays a bit of guitar and some bass. It's a really good song, and maybe the only song on this album that doesn't have anything to do with life and death. Hendrix wrote this song during the last years of his life. He wrote it around 1968, when Jimi Hendrix was trying to be a part of the blues scene. But because he couldn't play the blues very well, he became part of the psychedelic scene and developed a sound that was unlike any other artist in history. It's an absolutely amazing sound that is like nothing else before or after it. This song is only on Jimi Hendrix albums and nobody else has ever made anything like this song.

We just played four instrumental songs on this album, but there are actually a lot of instrumental songs on this album. The album features nine other instrumental songs that also have a lot of other songs like they have. One of these songs is 'Up From the Skies', which is a song that sounds like a plane is flying right next to the studio. Some instruments and sounds are sampled, but most of the music is made with normal instruments, including guitars. It's a track that features Jimi Hendrix's guitar in one of its best moments. In the end of the song, the sound is repeated and a man is screaming in the background.

'Crosstown Traffic' (track nine on the album) is a song by Jimi Hendrix that deals with some issues about being in the middle of Los Angeles and living there. Jimi Hendrix was really into cars and cars were a good way for him to express how he felt. Jimi Hendrix was talking about driving down Sunset Boulevard, which is right near where we are living. It's a really fun song about the traffic of Los Angeles. The song is also about the music business, because Jimi Hendrix has not yet released his first album. Jimi Hendrix also is playing a role as an old woman in the song. The female voice says: 'It's only after a half hour after the show that the crowd really disappears and all that's left are the garbage cans and the last few police cars.' So, this song is a funk song about life in Los Angeles, but also about Jimi Hendrix's frustration.

'The Wind Cries Mary' (track ten on the album) is a song that was written by Jimi Hendrix and it features him playing an acoustic guitar. The song is really cool, but the song actually has many words and it's hard to believe that Jimi Hendrix never wrote lyrics to songs. This is one of the only songs on this album where Jimi Hendrix doesn't play the electric guitar. He plays an acoustic guitar that sounds like he has been smoking hashish for some time and his voice isn't clear. When he was younger, he was sick, so people thought that's why he made this album. But in the end, he says: 'But a storm is raging in my mind, and I wonder what I have done, I wonder how to carry on.' This is a beautiful song and it gives a bittersweet impression, as if Jimi Hendrix is looking at his life and is saying: 'What have I done?'

The next song on the album is called 'Stepping Stone' and this one is more like an orchestral kind of song. It's not as funky as the other songs, but it has a more orchestral sound. It features John Lee Hooker, who was the guitarist of the record company and had worked for Columbia Records. John Lee Hooker plays a guitar solo that sounds similar to his style and he's singing about the fact that the record company people, like Columbia Records, want Jimi Hendrix to be just like them. In the end, the record company pushes Jimi Hendrix to make this kind of music that no one wants. There are also a few orchestral sounds and some acoustic guitars that were recorded at the same time of the recording sessions as 'Stepping Stone'. 'Stepping Stone' is a very funky song, but it's in a different key. It's not as happy and funky as the songs before it. In a way, it's a darker song and it's a little scary in a way. The song has an orchestral ending, which is something that Jimi Hendrix had never done before. It's a really funky album. The album closes with the song 'Fire' (track eleven on the album), which is a song by Jimi Hendrix. He wrote the song after the recording sessions and he released it as a 45-rpm single. Jimi Hendrix also released an album called _Experience_.

'Fire' is a song that Jimi Hendrix wrote for his band the Experience in 1967. The recording of this song was done in New York at night and it features Jimi Hendrix's electric guitar and John Lee Hooker on the guitar. The song is written in a different key than any other song on the album. The song has a sound that sounds like it was recorded with new technology. The song has a fast pace and is very funky and it also features the harmonica sounds from Chet or Walter. Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison had different tastes, because Morrison was much darker than Jimi Hendrix. Morrison is more into heavy funk, but Jimi Hendrix doesn't really like this kind of stuff. His songs are more like songs from the sixties. He is more about rock and pop. Morrison is known for writing about sex and sex. He's more famous for that than Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix was very dark and moody. He liked to sing with a deep voice, which is what the song 'Fire' is about. In the beginning of the song, Jimi Hendrix sings: 'My sweet my pretty baby just make love with me.' But Jimi Hendrix also has some funky riffs in the song. The song is also a pop song that is kind of similar to 'The Wind Cries Mary', which was played earlier in this chapter. 'Fire' is also something that is going in the right direction, but it doesn't have the heavy funk feel like in some of the songs on this album. 'Fire' has a big band sound and it even has horns and some horn lines. The guitar sounds like it is being played by a young musician and not a rock and roll player. It's a really unique sound and Jimi Hendrix really liked this song.

In his biography called _The Electric Gypsy_ , by Charles Shaar Murray, Jimi Hendrix is described as 'a black guitarist from Seattle who had played with a R&B group in the early fifties'.

_Jimi Hendrix: The Ultimate Experience_ , was a bootleg album made from Jimi Hendrix concerts. Some of the concerts are from 1967. Jimi Hendrix's band, The Experience, did two concerts and then Jimi Hendrix was killed in 1970. The final concert of this album, which is called _Midnight Lightning_ , was recorded on July 4, 1970. It was the last time Jimi Hendrix performed live. The album is very rare and has three different songs from the master soundboard and four from the audience source.

The audience source comes from the soundboard that plays on stage (which is in the middle) while the other soundboard plays on the right channel. So,</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:38
