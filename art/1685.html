In this episode of the Short Time Happy Hour podcast, Mike has a guest appearance from one of my regular co-hosts, Dr. Chris, from the H.E.A.T (Heroes, Expats, and the Agenda for Truth)podcast to talk about the upcoming Trump vs Cruz matchup. We talk about the Cruz campaign, about how I don't want to see Cruz run, about my support for Ted, about his support for Ted, about immigration, and if it is a big deal who wins on Tuesday.

Dr. Chris and Mike

We'll be recording a video for Dr. Chris and I to talk about that interview when we get back from a trip, so watch our email inbox!

What happened to Mike?

Okay, this is an apology to everybody who has waited for my new podcast, "The Short Time Happy Hour" that we announced in episode one of the program.

One of the main purposes of that podcast was going to be to discuss the political and cultural differences between my home in the US and the home I share with my wife where I grew up in Spain.

As Mike and I have discussed many times in our regular podcasts, Mike is an American and I'm a Spanish speaker from Spain. I don't know if you can tell when I speak, but I am a bit of a ham. I love to talk about politics, and most of my family members are from other countries, but don't really talk about it, and especially don't share their political views.

I love our podcasts, and I enjoy talking about the differences between us in our cultural backgrounds. It is something I talk about in all of my posts here on my blog, and in my book.

So, how do I say things that sound interesting if I don't have a grasp on what Americans talk about?

Sometimes I feel like I have a really good grasp of where they are coming from, but for some reason it doesn't seem to come across well. I am going to be getting some help with that with this program. I think one of my strengths is understanding how to use words and phrases to make an idea clear, because I'm a speech language pathologist.

What changed?

I was talking about things that I want to talk about that, well, aren't going to be as obvious if I keep saying it.

I was thinking about what I will be covering in episode one, and the best thing to do is to show and tell you exactly what I am going to do, instead of trying to do it with a description.

So, I am actually going to have a guest on my show next Tuesday! Dr. Chris, who we've had on our other podcasts before, is coming on my program to tell you about how I see this election.

I've known Dr. Chris for years, even though we've never had him on the program together. For some of our other conversations, it is easy to guess that he is my best friend. When he wrote an article about the US voting system, I sent him a link and told him to re-do it. He didn't send me an email telling me that he did, but he re-wrote it and sent it to me.

He is the type of person I would give the floor to in any group discussion. He is well read and always has a good handle on things. I would love to have him on the podcast because he is a great person, and his opinions are very well thought out. I am excited that he will be joining me next Tuesday, but more importantly I know you will enjoy hearing him.

I will still try to do more casual episodes for the first week or so, just to get used to the new production of "The Short Time Happy Hour" podcast. This week will show you how we introduce guests to talk about the upcoming election and why we need to avoid the presidential debates if possible.

So don't forget to check out "The Short Time Happy Hour" podcast in your favourite podcast app of choice on Tuesday!
