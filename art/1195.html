"Bravo." "Great job." "Let me just clean that off." "Sorry." "Guys, we did it." "We stopped them." "All right!" "Yeah!" "My name is Sam Oliver." "And we are Gryzzl Prison Guards." "We work for the Kaiser." "Uh-huh." "And this is Gryzzl Prison in Panem." "What you are about to see is a behind the scenes look" "At the ruthless business of the Gryzzl Prison for Women." "So are you saying you just walked out?" "That's exactly what we're saying." "We walked out." "We walked out of the prison, grabbed a couple of horses, ran down the road." "They were shooting at us the whole way." "This thing was planned pretty carefully." "They're getting pretty good at this, huh?" "Okay, first things first, ladies." "We need to go get some supplies." "Supplies?" "Did you not notice?" "We just escaped from prison." "You just escaped." "We're on the lam." "We need to get out of the city." "What about water?" "Water." "What about water?" "Huh?" "Guys, don't worry about that." "You just focus on packing up." "Yeah, we got to..." "we got to get water and stuff." "Just think about that later." "So..." "There you go." "I already packed my stuff." "What's mine is yours." "All right." "Okay, okay." "That's right." "It's a Gryzzl van, so it's basically a prison on wheels." "What?" "Is it safe?" "Well, um..." "Yeah, the chances of getting shot are like one in a million." "So, we're like, what?" "One in a million times safe?" "The chance of getting shot is so low, you got a better chance of winning the lottery." "See, if we're the lottery, then odds are a lot better than a million to one that you're gonna get shot, but they don't call it "the million to one shot" for nothing." "So if we get shot, it doesn't mean we lose." "No." "No." "Not if you're lucky." "You know, odds are a lot better than a million to one that you guys are gonna get shot too." "You know, it's gonna be me, it's gonna be one of you two and then that guy." "You're gonna get killed pretty quick." "It doesn't have to happen." "It doesn't have to happen." "That's right." "So we're the same chance of getting shot as anybody else in this van." "Yeah." "In a way, you're all one in a million." "Okay." "Okay." "All right, so what do you think we should do?" "You can't go to the police." "We're fugitives." "No." "There's got to be like an underground railroad for people who have escaped from prison." "Yeah." "We have to go to the one person who can help us." "One of us has to go back into the prison." "It's a prision-break scenario, I get it." "You know, guys, actually, you should both go back into the prison." "And just what, be spies for a while until we find a way to break out?" "Yeah." "It's better than just you." "Okay, what are we supposed to do here?" "Just let him go back and maybe get shot?" "Well, he's the one who got us into this mess, so he is just gonna get himself shot trying to save our asses again." "No offense, but you're a terrible shot." "Well, you would be too if someone shot you in the head." "But you would be dead." "So it's better than you." "I think you should go back." "Okay, well, if you think I should go back," "Then I think that you should go back." "How about this?" "How about you go back, and we just stay here?" "Then we don't have to go to the prison to help your cause." "Okay, well, who said I was trying to..." "You said." "Yeah, but, guys, listen." "I'm trying to save my wife's life." "I'm trying to keep this operation alive." "I am trying to help the cause." "I think you go." "Okay." "Are you ready?" "Yeah." "Okay." "Go!" "No!" "No!" "That's for me." "Come on." "Come on." "Where are you going?" "Where are you going?" "We got to, uh..." "He's really hurt." "We got to go help him." "Hey!" "I know we're trying to do the right thing here, but if we don't, then everyone that we've been fighting for our whole lives is gonna die." "You really want that on your head?" "Just help me with this." "Go, go." "I'll stay behind and put pressure on his wound." "Okay." "Go." "Okay." "All right, all right." "All right, let's go." "Here." "Let's put this over his wound and let's just go." "Yeah, yeah, yeah." "All right." "Let's go." "Here's the deal, guys, okay?" "We need to get out of here, get to the border." "The borders are all guarded." "We're not gonna make it anyway." "Look, it's not about making it to the border." "It's about making it to the exfil point, and I don't know exactly where that is, but I can probably draw you a map." "No, no, no, no, no." "I don't need a map, okay?" "I need you to shut up." "Can you guys please try to stay on the same page for once?" "This guy right here doesn't need a map." "He needs a doctor." "Can we just make sure we get to the exfil point and then we can find a doctor?" "Do you hear that?" "The police are coming." "That was quick." "Well, I'm not so sure about that." "Wait, did you hear that?" "Where are you going?" "I got to make a diversion." "How do I make a diversion?" "The police are coming!" "Wait." "What is the diversion?" "Make a distraction, guys." "Let's see if I can attract the police." "What do you mean?" "What do you mean?" "What do you mean?" "What do you mean?" "I mean, there's a bunch of broken glass on the floor right there." "Are you throwing your bag of glass on the floor right there?" "Hey, are you okay?" "Can I help you?" "We are just trying to get away from this prison." "You see, I was locked up in that prison, and I want to go home, but now it's overrun with the rebels." "We're not rebels, we're prisoners." "Prisoners trying to get away from the prison." "Thank you so much." "Thank you so much." "I was shot and left for dead." "Thank you." "Thank you." "I mean..." "Thanks, buddy." "Oh, thanks, bro." "Thanks, brother." "Hey, dude." "All right, thank you so much." "Thank you so much." "I mean, you saved our life, so thank you." "Yeah, of course, man." "Of course." "Yeah, no problem." "Thank you." "Your father was right." "You saved the revolution." "Thank you so much." "I told you this was gonna be our destiny." "Daddy?" "Daddy!" "Hey, I'm over here!" "I got you, daddy!" "You got a little scrape on your elbow, though." "I got you, daddy!" "We got to get going now, we got to get going now." "Go, go, go, go!" "Don't worry about it." "You're safe now, buddy." "You're safe now." "Where's daddy?" "Your dad's right here." "Honey." "We got him." "He's okay." "Hey, buddy." "What are you doing?" "Hey, what are you doing?" "I can't feel my legs!" "Don't give up." "Don't give up." "We got you." "Don't you give up." "We got you." "Stay with me." "It's okay, buddy." "Everything's gonna be okay." "Stay with me." "You got him, right?" "Don't worry, dude." "Daddy's right here." "Everything's gonna be fine, buddy." "Get him back, get him back." "Get him back." "I'll never let you go again!" "Never!" "Just never!" "You're never getting away from us again!" "Your wife is here." "Your wife is here!" "We can't wait to meet you guys!" "I know I'm a little late in coming over here and saying something, but I hope you'll all forgive me for doing what I did." "If I had to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:35
