A delicious and easy way to cook bacon is to do it on a grill. By cooking bacon over a low flame you can get the same smoky, fatty flavor that you get from the microwave but without all of that excess fat and grease. If you want to lower the amount of fat you use, then take your bacon outside and start cooking it over a low flame for 10 minutes or so before microwaving it. Also, if you use a bacon tray in the microwave, then try cooking your bacon in the same tray that it was packaged in. It’s an easy, and time saving trick that will leave your bacon crispy, but not greasy. And you won’t have to clean up a grease covered tray afterwards.

Bacon Recipes

Aside from some homemade marinara, these three recipes show how you can easily prepare bacon without giving you unwanted fat and grease. If you’re looking for a new way to prepare bacon and you want to give the microwave option a try, then try one of these three recipes. But you might just have to try them all out. There’s really no need to choose just one.

One of the best ways to use leftover bacon is to make a recipe that calls for it. Bacon adds a great flavor, and texture to many foods. Whether you’re using bacon in pasta, or a soup, these recipes will prove that the simplest way to cook bacon in the microwave is the best way. But if you want to get more flavor out of bacon, try using a quality frying bacon. It’s usually cheaper than bacon that’s packaged in Styrofoam trays, and it’s much easier to prepare.

Bacon Noodles

You may already know that Italian sausage is great in a savory scramble, but now you can add bacon into the mix as well. This dish uses bacon and Italian sausage to make a savory scramble that’s great for breakfast or lunch. Bacon makes the best topping for any type of egg, so if you’ve never tried it before this could be the perfect opportunity to try it. Serve it up with some steamed asparagus for a complete meal.

Bacon Noodle Casserole

If you want to make a great meatloaf that has the potential to turn into a casserole, then this is a good recipe to try. It has plenty of good ingredients to make it a real meatloaf. But the bacon will give it the great flavor that makes it something special. As a nice bonus, this dish is packed with good veggies. This means you won’t feel as though you’re missing out on anything.

In the microwave bacon is great for so many things. Whether it’s a sandwich or a scramble, this meat can be cooked in so many different ways. But one of the best ways is by cooking it directly on a plate and cutting it up in little pieces. This can help you make those sandwiches look a little more festive, and make the bacon a little thicker and more flavorful. While it isn’t as traditional of a way to cook bacon, it’s an easy and delicious way to prepare bacon in the microwave.

And of course, if you want to cook bacon for breakfast, but don’t have any bacon in the house, don’t worry. There are some great breakfast options that are great substitutes for bacon. Try adding slices of Canadian bacon to your scrambled eggs, or cook up a breakfast burrito made with turkey bacon and Swiss cheese. See this great article for ideas on bacon substitutes for you breakfast meals.
