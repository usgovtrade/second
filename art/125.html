Our story begins with our hero,
Moriarty, standing in the middle of a quiet
room.
He’s wearing a nice navy blue suit and a
big red tie, his favorite tie.
He’s got a pair of white leather loafers
on his feet, and the heels of his shoes click
against the hardwood floor as he steps forward
toward a coffee table.
There are white balloons and a basket full
of brightly wrapped presents, all sitting
on the coffee table.
Moriarty looks around and notices his reflection
in a mirror hanging on the wall.
He turns and steps back to check himself
out in the mirror.
Moriarty then starts unbuttoning his jacket
as he stares at his reflection and smiles.
“I think you look good, Harry,” he says
as he button it back up.
As Moriarty steps away from the mirror, he
looks back at it.
He smiles, then looks around the room, as if
wondering where he is.
As Moriarty begins to frown, he looks down
at his watch.
“Hmmmm…”
Moriarty looks back up at the mirror.
He looks away, then turns back to the mirror
again.
He smiles.
“Come on, Harry.
What’s keeping you, my boy?
Get on with it.”
Moriarty looks around the room again and
moves towards a desk, sitting down in a black
chair that’s against the wall.
A secretary sits across from him, watching
him closely as he sits down.
He’s got a briefcase sitting in front of
him, with a pile of papers next to it.
“Don’t worry, Harry.
You’re fine,” he says as he opens the
briefcase and pulls out a cigar.
He lights the cigar and smokes it.
After a while, Moriarty opens the briefcase
again and pulls out a gold fountain pen, his
favorite one.
He looks up at the secretary and gestures
to the papers.
“You like that,” he says, as he writes
in blue ink on the paper.
Moriarty steps back and looks at his watch.
He takes a puff off his cigar and looks back
at his watch.
“Not much longer,” he says to himself,
as he stares at the paper and the fountain
pen.
“Okay, Miss Jones, now let’s talk.”
Moriarty turns the paper towards the secretary,
who immediately writes down the number and
instructions on it.
As she looks back at him, he continues.
“Just remember…
When the boy comes to work today, don’t
say anything, alright?”
“Yes, sir,” the secretary answers back,
as she turns the paper over to Moriarty.
Moriarty takes another puff of his cigar,
then looks at his watch.
“Five-fifteen,” he says as he opens a drawer
in the desk and pulls out a black plastic
card.
“Remember, I’ll be waiting for him here
when he arrives, alright?
That’s why you’re in a small room.
I need him to think he’s safe.”
The secretary nods, then looks at the card
once more.
“I’ll be here, Mr. Moriarty, sir.”
Moriarty takes the card and looks at it.
“Good girl,” he says as he puts it away
and smiles.
He grabs the black plastic card and walks
over to his watch.
As he turns it over, he shakes his head.
“No, it’s definitely not enough time,
my boy,” he says.
He takes the plastic card back and looks at
the watch again, as he smiles.
“Alright.
Let’s call for the papers.”
Moriarty shakes his head and smiles as he
pulls out a metal briefcase, sitting on the
desk.
He opens the briefcase and pulls out two
documents.
One of the documents is about 5x7 in size,
and is written in black ink.
The other document is about 12x8 in size,
and is written in red ink.
Moriarty starts to read the documents over
and over as he looks down at his watch.
“How did it go?
She should be here any second now.”
Moriarty looks back up at the secretary and
smiles.
“If you could leave the documents right
on the table.
You know the password,” Moriarty tells
her.
“Yes, Mr. Moriarty, sir.”
The secretary steps away from the desk and
looks down at the documents on the table.
She nods.
“The password is ‘Baba’.”
Moriarty nods and hands the documents over.
As the secretary opens the documents and
read them, she looks at Moriarty.
“Are they ready?”
Moriarty nods and smiles, as he turns away
from her and looks up at the clock.
“Just be careful, Harry.
Don’t forget the password.”
Moriarty looks at the clock and grins as
he pulls out his fountain pen.
He quickly writes the password on the bottom
of the first document, then looks at his
watch.
“Nine o’clock… she’s probably here
any minute,” he says.
As the secretary reads over the first document,
she gets scared when she sees his writing
on the bottom.
“Well, Miss Jones, here we go,” Moriarty
says as he stands and hands over the documents.
“Make sure you watch my boy when he walks
in, alright?
It’s a dangerous situation.
That’s why I want you to keep an eye on
him.”
The secretary nods.
“Will you be joining the boy, sir?”
Moriarty looks at her and smiles.
“Oh, no.
I’ll wait for him here.
Let the boy come into the room all on his
own.
Make sure you see him come in and watch over
him.
Now, if he has an issue, then you let me
know.
You stay close and follow him around.
Don’t go into the room, understand?
That’s not necessary.”
The secretary nods.
“Don’t worry, sir.
I’ll do just that.”
Moriarty nods as he walks towards the door.
He opens it and looks back at her.
“Stay outside in the hallway until you hear
me come in.”
The secretary nods as she watches Moriarty
leave the office.
A few seconds later, she hears the sound
of the elevator open and shut.
She looks at the papers on the desk and smiles.
“Baba,” she says to herself, then looks
back down at the papers.
She opens up the first document and looks
over it quickly.
She reads it again, then looks back up.
She smiles and looks at the second document.
She looks over it quickly, then nods.
She makes her way towards the door, opens
it, and steps out into the hallway.
She can see Moriarty talking on the phone
in his office, but can’t make out what
he’s saying.
She’s not sure if she should wait until
he’s finished or not.
As she looks at the door, she can see her
reflection in the glass.
She turns and looks at the other end of the
hallway, where her desk is.
She goes over to the desk and sits down, smiling.
Moriarty is still on the phone and is listening.
He’s looking at his watch and talking to
himself.
He puts the phone down and looks at his watch.
“Yes, that’s right.
Yes.
Thank you for that.”
Moriarty puts the phone down and looks at
his watch again.
He smiles and pulls out his fountain pen.
“One more minute… you’re looking lovely,
just the way I like.
We’ll call for more papers in a few hours.
Alright, just keep checking back in with
me, just to make sure everything is going
fine.
I’m just going to stand by right now.”
Moriarty looks up at the clock again.
It’s 10 minutes to 10:00.
He starts to frown.
He quickly shakes his head and smiles.
“Well, he’s coming to the room any minute.
He should be here in about 10 minutes</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:09
