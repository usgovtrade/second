to say about Enron becoming financially stable and wise enough to profit 
without being an actual monopoly.  
The plan is not specific to any particular group of business people or what 
the company would be called.  It is completely general in it's outlook.  
Therefore, you must read the plan if you want to see if Enron can become the 
company you hope it can be.

I would rather not receive these.  Thanks.

Attached is a very rough draft of a blog posting that discusses the public 
relations aspects of the proposed and possibleatted DWR takeover of the 
state's power transmission system.  If you have any comments, please get them 
in soon, as we want to put this out tomorrow.  I would be very interested in 
your comments.

Best,
Jeff
