Scarlet Witch, who has been missing since Secret Wars and presumed dead since Avengers #675, will appear as a host for a mysterious entity called "Dark Reality".

Doctor Strange joins the Marvel Universe after many years away. His "ghost" will be made real and will seek out the rest of the Ancient Order of the Shield. With him is the one called Dormammu, master of the Dark Dimension.

Daredevil, along with Hawkeye and the Young Avengers, will hunt down a new breed of demon who are attempting to resurrect "The Man Without Fear." The new villain is a human raised by vampires in Romania who has the ability to transform into a demon.

After being resurrected by a mystical meteorite, Thor falls into a cave and is forced to battle a female dragon named Jormangundr. With his hammer he is able to repel the dragon, but he takes a terrible blow. Only moments later Thor finds himself in Asgard, where he is welcomed with open arms by Queen Frigga and given the "Scepter of Asgard" as a symbol of his restored status as ruler of Asgard and its people.

Vision, the Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote are forced to fend off the Hood's mercenaries after an unidentified group called "The Ten Rings" attack a school. They discover this group was hired by an anonymous woman claiming to be the Black Widow.

Star-Lord is recruited by the time traveling Kang the Conqueror to join his version of the Masters of Evil.

Namor is resurrected by the Serpent Crown and joins the battle between Earth's heroes and its demons.

The original X-Men are brought back from the dead.

Nighthawk is revealed to be a false hero, a hired assassin who had pretended to be a hero to steal secrets from the Avengers.

The X-Men join the fight against The Inhumans and Inhumans: Attilan Rising.

During the Inhumans vs. X-Men battle, Dazzler is taken over by the Hellfire Club, which wants to harness her music to enslave humanity.

In order to obtain the cure to his cancer, Steve Rogers travels to a parallel universe where all of history is the same as it is in the current Marvel Universe.

The Superior Spider-Man, whose mind has been damaged during the battle, is cured of his powers by a mysterious man named Danielle Cage. She calls herself Spider-Woman, and calls him into her spider-trance. He rejects the offer, and resumes his life as Peter Parker.

Mandarin, who was shot by Hawkeye in Secret Wars, is alive once again and becomes a pawn in the new War of Light storyline.

The Fantastic Four, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Fantastic Four: Big Time and The Fantastic Four are all restored to their proper time period in the new timeline.

Bucky Barnes' fate is revealed in the final pages of Captain America: Reborn.

Following the events of Secret Wars, Doctor Doom's empire is destroyed in another Skrull invasion. The Fantastic Four attempt to recreate Doom's empire, but fail, and decide to return to their original time period to live with Franklin Richards.

The Inhumans attack the United States government and steal the power of the President of the United States.

S.H.I.E.L.D., under the control of the Secret Empire, begins the Inhumans' extermination. This leads into Secret Empire.

Secret Empire

Steve Rogers decides that he is not going to "bury himself in the past".

Iron Man and Ant-Man lead a team of Avengers in a mission to take down the Secret Empire. They will join up with Spider-Man, Nova, Wolverine, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Venom, Ghost Rider, Luke Cage, Doctor Strange, the Thing and Dr. Doom in an attempt to liberate the Inhumans.

This will be a very short event series. It will also come to an end in issue #6, and lead directly into the next major event, Infinity War.

Darth Vader, who has not been seen since Secret Wars, will return in his original role as Vader and will serve as the lead character in the new ongoing series, Star Wars: Dark Empire.

The Guardians of the Galaxy take on Darth Vader and the Masters of the Universe.

Thor is captured and used as a prisoner by the forces of Galactus.

Doctor Strange discovers that it is his counterpart, Dormammu, who has brought him to Doomworld. Strange has to rescue Doctor Doom in order to defeat Dormammu and escape the Negative Zone. Doctor Doom has to choose between being trapped in the Negative Zone or seeing Doctor Strange freed.

Doctor Doom and Doctor Strange defeat Dormammu and are teleported to Earth. Doom declares that he will create his own empire from scratch.

This storyline will lead directly into Infinity Wars. It is intended to give more exposition on Doctor Doom's history as well as give him the role he's always been meant to have in the Marvel Universe. The Infinity Gauntlet will be given to him by Odin to control, in exchange for "forgiveness" for the damage he caused during Secret Wars.

The New Avengers (Namor, Vision, Human Torch, Thor, Dr. Strange and Dormammu) are attacked by Thanos' army. Thanos and his army of Super-Skrulls are attempting to control the world's forces by using the Cosmic Bands of Power.
