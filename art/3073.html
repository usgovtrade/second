The use of enhanced separators to direct ionic liquids from an aqueous electrolyte to a hydrocarbon-based collector was investigated. The combination of ionic liquids with water is ubiquitous in the energy sector. Despite their significant technological benefits, the use of ionic liquids in advanced battery technologies is limited by the difficulties of ionic liquid recycling. To address this need, a combined ionic liquid/water separator, developed in our lab, has been shown to efficiently and selectively separate the ionic liquid from aqueous solution. We found that the selectivity between the ionic liquid and water can be readily tuned by altering the solution concentrations and temperature. Selectivity increases as the electrolyte concentration decreases, due to the increase in the diffusion of the ionic liquid towards the separator. The ionic liquid can be collected by applying a continuous negative pressure through an inlet at the bottom of the cell. A series of experimental tests show that the cell can generate a high voltage and high ionic liquid collecting rate under low current conditions. We further demonstrate the continuous water and ionic liquid separation in our system. The demonstration of selective ionic liquid collection will help to realize a sustainable and more efficient advanced battery technology.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:08
