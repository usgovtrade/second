build
  new features in Perl 5 called "XSUBs" (Experimental Subroutines).
This document details some of the benefits of XSUBs and details the 
mechanics of
  using them.

=head1 Synopsis

In a nutshell, the mechanism allows you to take a Perl subroutine,
convert its signature, and then use it in a completely new signature.
For example, suppose we had a subroutine

    sub foo
    {
        ...
    }

we can take the subroutine and convert it into a Perl 5 XSUBs object with

    my $xs = XSUBs::foo->new( ... );

You can then call XSUBs to apply the subroutine to some arguments.
XSUBs will automagically convert the args into the required "arg type"
for your subroutine. The signature of a function is a really powerful
feature in Perl 5. However, because the signatures are so flexible, you
can easily end up with many small subroutines with few arg types in
use. This can become messy very quickly. XSUBs takes all this extra
information out of the equation.

For a more in-depth discussion of what is going on, please read the
XSUBs::Intro article. That should give a better
overview of the system. This document details the implementation of
the object and its arguments and provides some usage examples. It is
not a how-to document, but should give you an idea of what the code
looks like.

=head2 Basic Use

You should always use XSUBs via a class.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use XSUBs::Stuff;

    my $thing = XSUBs::Thing->new(
	arg1 => shift,
	arg2 => shift,
	arg3 => shift,
    );

To illustrate the usage, I'll define a simple class

    package XSUBs::Stuff;

    use XSUBs;

    sub new {
	my ($class, $args) = @_;

	return bless {}, $class;
    }

    sub foo {
	my $self = shift;

	return ($self->arg1 + $self->arg2) / 2;
    }

    1;

The method that gets called here, foo(), takes two arguments.
We don't care about the actual argument types, we'll work them out when
we call foo().

    my $thing = XSUBs::Thing->new(
	arg1 => 1,
	arg2 => 3,
    );

    my $result = $thing->foo(2);

    print "$result\n"; # prints 5

This provides a very powerful method of building new subroutines
without needing to write all that code yourself. (I'll assume you
already have an XSUBs class here, that isn't part of the base Perl
module set).

If you call foo() on an XSUBs object, it will then use the method signature
to construct the args. So we could have

    my $thing = new XSUBs::Stuff(
	arg1 => 1,
	arg2 => 2,
    );

    $thing->foo(); # prints 5

    my $thing = new XSUBs::Stuff(
	arg1 => 3,
	arg2 => 4,
    );

    $thing->foo(); # prints 7

If you define an XSUBs object like the above, you can easily build new
subroutines with one or two args, as you see in the examples above.
However, in the real world, we often have more. The above examples
have shown using two args, but you can have as many as you like. If
you want to define an XSUBs object with three args, all you need to
do is add an arg3 to the new() method.

    # Create the XSUBs object with 3 arguments

    my $thing = new XSUBs::Stuff(
	arg1 => 1,
	arg2 => 2,
	arg3 => 3,
    );

Then call foo() with three args as above. It will construct the method
signature automatically, calling our method definition as required.
(The default args will be 'undef' in most cases, which is why the above
examples didn't explicitly have 'undef' args.

If you had provided

    my $thing = new XSUBs::Stuff(
	arg1 => 1,
	arg2 => 2,
	arg3 => undef,
    );

then XSUBs would simply ignore arg3 when constructing the subroutine.

This is where XSUBs really shines. Instead of writing many
different subroutines with different signatures, you can use
XSUBs to create a generalized, higher level method.

For example, suppose we wanted to take two numbers, subtract one of
them, and then take the result and put it in the first arg.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use XSUBs::Stuff;

    my $thing = new XSUBs::Stuff(
	arg1 => shift,
	arg2 => shift,
    );

    my $result = $thing->subtract(sub {
	    return $_[0] - $_[1];
	});

    print "$result\n"; # prints 4

We never needed to define a new subroutine in this example, we just had
to call it in a different place. One could easily define all kinds of
different subroutines with different signatures and just call them
via XSUBs.

You can also define subroutines to take arguments of varying types.
For example, say we wanted to allow you to take some options to
subtract with. We could define a constructor like so:

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use XSUBs::Stuff;

    my $options = {
	option1 => {
	    isa => 'Integer',
	    value => 8,
	    # etc.
	},
	option2 => {
	    isa => 'ArrayRef',
	    size => 6,
	    # etc.
	},
	option3 => {
	    isa => 'Numeric',
	    value => 5.9,
	    # etc.
	},
    };

    my $thing = new XSUBs::Stuff(
	arg1 => $options->{arg1},
	arg2 => $options->{arg2},
    );

The XSUBs class takes the definition and creates the args accordingly.
Since we defined the various options as references, the arg type is
also given as a reference. Also note that the number of arguments
matches the number of elements in the arrayref.

So, once again, all you need to do is specify the args and the
methods. The XSUBs class takes care of everything else for you.

=head2 The Args

XSUBs is really powerful when you consider that it knows the arguments
from the return type.

There are three important features of an argument. First, the class of
the argument. Second, any type modifiers the method signature supports.
And third, the var arg list, which represents an ordered array of
arguments that can be passed to any method.

All types are derived from the core Perl type system. So all arguments
can be represented as strings or references. If the subroutine doesn't
care about an argument, then the arg type will be 'undef'. In the
example above, $self is a reference. The return type is an integer
likewise.

XSUBs allows you to specify arbitrary number of var args. You can specify
as many as you like by passing a reference of arbitrary size to the
args. The last arg is an arrayref, which specifies the number of args
beyond the var args. The arg type is the final arg, which
will either be the base type or a reference to the base type.

So, a typical method definition is

    sub bar (Int $x, $y, $z = undef, ArrayRef[1,2,3] $myArrayref) {
	return "$x $y $z";
    }

This defines three arguments.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:29
