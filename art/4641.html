What is the difference between a "drip" and a "glimpse"?

The game Gloom, one of the first computer games I have ever played, has the following rule:

No card may be looked at directly except when it is in the Drip Zone. (source)

To me, "drip" implies that some card had to be previously looked at. I am not sure what the difference is between a "drip" and a "glimpse". Is there a specific rule in the game that differentiates between them?

A:

A Glance is just a random look at a card. A Drip means you can take another look only when another card gets revealed. The game keeps track of what you've looked at.
If there's no hinting that a Glance is more restrictive than a Drip, there's no real difference in how a game is played. But consider this:
A player glances at one of his cards and then puts it back on the table face up. Another player says: "Look at that". Does it count as a Glance? Or does the player have to say "take another Drip at that"? It's different if you're in a competitive game. It becomes more important as you get closer to the endgame.

A:

A glance is the act of looking at a card for a moment.
A drip is a single additional look, only allowed under specific conditions, that you can make once per player turn.
A glance can be made during your turn, any time, while other players can't.
A drip is allowed once per turn, you can't look at any card more than once.  
A card that isn't on the drip turn table can be looked at only on that turn or another drip turn.  
A dribbled card can't be looked at again in the same turn. A card that has already been looked at is not a dribbled card.

So a dribbled card can't be looked at any more. A card that has already been looked at can be looked at again.
If a card is a dribbled card it stays on the board and you can look at it again on your next turn.
A card that has been dripped and then found on the drip turn table can only be looked at on the turn it was dripped or the next drip turn.

So a drip is when you get to look at one more card than someone else does, once per turn.
A glance is allowed at any time during the game.
Gloom isn't a game with much rules, this seems to be the most important way that looks are treated differently.  
You can read more about it here in a more developed answer.

A:

A dribble allows a player to view a card, without having looked at it previously.
A glance allows you to view a card, but you can't remember that you have already done so.
If a card gets dripped, it will remain on the Drip Zone until an opponent glances at it.

A:

A Glimpse is the act of looking at a card (not your own, unless you are the caster).
A Drip is a card that can only be seen by someone who doesn't own it (or doesn't own all of the same cards that you do).
It's important to note that a Drip does not always have to be viewed immediately, it's just that you can't view that card again.

An example of where the rule can be more confusing:
A card is revealed.
You're not allowed to look at it at all - even if you do take a peek and don't find anything, or remember that the card is blank.
After that first look, the card stays on the Drip Zone.
The next person to look at it will find it, and the next person after that will remember that they've already looked at it.  They can take a third look at it, if they want, but can't view it again.
So even though they technically haven't done anything illegal by checking to see what the card is, you're being cautious about looking at it again.

The only way you can look at a card for the first time on the Drip Zone is by Dribbling it to a player that doesn't own it yet (or doesn't own all of the cards that you own).

This can help you get the full picture:
Imagine you're the first one in the game, and you draw 5 (the number of players in the game) cards.
The only way you can look at them is by a Dribble, so you Dribble to Player 1.
Player 1 looks at them, and then they get Dripped to Player 2.
Player 2 now looks at the cards, and Dribbles to Player 3.
Player 3 looks at them, and then they get Dripped to Player 4.
Player 4 looks at them, and then they get Dribbled to Player 5.
Player 5 looks at them, and they get Dribbled to Player 6.
Player 6 looks at them, and they get Dribbled to Player 7.
Player 7 looks at them, and they get Dribbled to Player 8.
Player 8 looks at them, and they get Dribbled to Player 1.
