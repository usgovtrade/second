the need to provide an automated, paperless solution to a very manual 
billing process and the need to meet the new challenges posed by G/L 
accounting.

We are currently testing the Synergy Billing system which will replace the 
old Unify system. We are very optimistic that we will have it ready to go 
live in  a test environment by the middle of  next week. The production 
environment will be up and ready by August 8.

Synergy Billing was written in house, a team of developers from across 
Enron bandwidth and claims, is now working on modifications to make it 
"business ready". The new Synergy Billing system uses existing functionality 
of Concur (G/L Accounting) and CTS (Corporate Travel) and adds some new 
functionality like codition based invoices and online payments.

We will roll out the Synergy Billing system to all operational groups over 
the next ten weeks and we plan to fully migrate all new deals by October.

Seats will fill fast.

EWS Training Team

EWS Training has been the "voice of EWS" throughout the organization. Now,  
it's our turn to show EWS what "we know" can do. In order to provide a solid 
foundation for our "new" strategic direction, EWS Management has put together 
an EWS training team that will provide dedicated, one on one training, 
technical assistance, planning and implementation. This group has been 
working in the EWS Training Department throughout the year and will be 
available for any team member that will be interested in attending a class. 
Your cooperation in helping us "Spread the Word" to the rest of the 
organization has been a key to our success so far. All team members in the 
Settlements and Volume Management, Risk Management, IT Systems Development 
and Operations and Customer Service Groups have been handpicked from "here 
and there" to provide specific targeted training that will help us to resolve 
some of the problems we have identified.  We have identified 6 senior 
leadership/change agents and have given them each the responsibility to 
maximize EWS knowledge within their area of responsibility.

EWS Budget

The EWS budget has not been provided.  While we have attempted to make cost 
savings in all areas of the EWS budget, the largest area has been with the 
implementation of "Phase I" of EnronOnline.  We look forward to providing 
your business unit the "EWS Training Budget" as soon as possible.  

EWS Business Partners

All "new" EWS business partners and customers will receive a visit from the 
EWS Training Team to review EWS related products and services, answer 
questions and make/facilitate "on-line" deals.  

EWS Business Houses

EWS marketing/sales personnel have been working with potential EWS business 
partners throughout this "new economy" to raise awareness of EWS capabilities.  
Many of these potential EWS deals have been with "new" customers or "new" 
business partners.  New associations with former customers and business 
partners are also important. 

EWS Staff/Employees

Certain EWS employees/units have been or will be retrained. For example, 
EWS Legal will be changing its name and some personnel.  Additionally, as 
the "new" EWS business units become operational, our "ex-EWS" employees have 
been asked to remain within their current EWS units. Also, certain other EWS 
functions (IT, HR, RAC, etc.) have been or will be retrained. 


The above represents the efforts that have been expended to make EWS "new" 
run as smooth as possible. There have been "a few" hiccups and we know that 
you will continue to be a key part in getting EWS operational. In order to 
provide the best and most comfortable learning experience, the EWS 
Training/Business Partner Teams will continue to "push the envelope" in your 
training and business partner development efforts.

Thank you for your efforts and continuing support,

Stan "Ron" Horn
Director - EWS Training and Business Partner Development
