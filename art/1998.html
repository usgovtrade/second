While preparing to undergo PCI audits, a business should be aware of the security compliances that would be of benefit to it. It should be able to tell the PCI or HIPAA inspector that it complies with PCI DSS or HIPAA in order to secure its credit card details and patient records. Here are some quick tips on how to comply with the standards and ensure your business continues to run without problems.

First and foremost, any business engaged in selling any product or service is considered a ‘covered entity’ under the PCI DSS standard. Such entities are required to implement controls to safeguard customers’ private data, among other security standards. The first step to secure your credit card details and patient information is to undergo security awareness training so that staff understand how data can be secured in the right way.

When a company stores such information, it must have in place a written security policy and procedure. It must also establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical controls on access to and use of information.

It is important to note that PCI compliance is not meant to be a one-time endeavour. It is a continuous journey that can only be achieved through continuous improvements and adjustments to security policies and procedures. Once the proper steps have been put in place, it will be easier to protect sensitive information and maintain a low level of fraud.
