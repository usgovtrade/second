Generally speaking, the air filter device of the present development is of the type comprising a hollow body, as a cylindrical filter cartridge or the like, through which the air is conducted in a flow direction from an intake side to an outlet side. In one end of the hollow body, there is provided an air inlet opening which communicates with the intake side, while a plurality of inlet channels are present in the other end of the hollow body, which channels open into the interior space of the hollow body and which open out into the outlet side. At a certain distance behind the inlet side there is mounted an air outlet element which is also known as outlet fan and which extends transversely to the direction of air flow, whereby the air passing through the inlet channels is guided in a circumferential manner about the filter device, while it flows to the outlet side. The air is drawn through the filter medium by means of the air stream which flows through the channels and impinges upon the outer surface thereof. This air stream causes a vortex to be generated which rotates in the circumferential direction of the filter cartridge, in the direction of flow. This vortex, like a spirally rotating turbine, enables all of the dust particles to be drawn in by the air stream and removed from the filter chamber. For this purpose there is provided a plurality of baffle elements or vanes which extend in a wall or cylinder wall of the filter cartridge and which delimit the inlet side from the outlet side. These baffle elements or vanes are adapted to be moved back and forth along the longitudinal axis of the filter device. They are normally biased or hinged in such a manner that the vortex which is generated rolls back into itself and an inner flow is formed which causes an increase in pressure or backflow.
The advantage of this heretofore known air filter device is that the dust or dust-like particles are collected within the filter cartridge, which means that the dust can be removed in a closed filter chamber, i.e. dust does not escape from the filter chamber to the outside. However, an additional disadvantage exists because the above described arrangement of baffle elements is only suitable for small quantities of dust and dirt. Large quantities of dust or dirt could collect on these baffle elements or vanes, which would lead to a breakdown of the air filter device. Additionally, there is the danger of these baffle elements becoming tilted due to large quantities of dust, which can cause the formation of dust cones, resulting in loss of air velocity, particularly in the region of the outlet side. This could result in a significant pressure loss and a deterioration in the efficiency of the air filter device.
This disadvantage was recognized and addressed in a heretofore known air filter device with a circular cross-section in German Pat. No. DE-PS 2,719,837. In this arrangement, the circular cross-section is provided by an annular shaped filter cartridge, in which the outlet side is formed by an annular shaped air outlet element. The suction inlet side is formed by an annular shaped inlet chamber which communicates with a plurality of inlet channels or holes. The annular shaped filter cartridge forms an inner wall of the inlet chamber, whereby the filter cartridge can be arranged and displaced in axial direction and in an angular orientation. In order to guide the air flow through the filter device, the latter is provided with two baffle elements or vanes which extend in the cylinder wall of the filter cartridge. However, the baffle elements are constructed in two parts and are displaced and movable relative to each other. By actuating an adjusting device, the baffle elements are made to slide in axial direction along the cylinder wall of the filter cartridge.
This arrangement for guiding air through a filter device has the disadvantage that when the displacement and movement of the baffle elements takes place, the movement produces turbulence in the air flow which is particularly troublesome in the vicinity of the outlet side. Moreover, there is also a danger of the baffle elements becoming tilted and producing dust cones which could lead to a loss of pressure, whereby the efficiency of the filter device could be reduced. This disadvantage was sought to be avoided in an air filter device of the initially described type which has been known for a long time and which is used to remove contaminants from the intake air of an internal combustion engine, by means of the arrangement disclosed in German Published Patent Application No. DE-OS 2,556,943. In this air filter device, which is also constructed as a filter cartridge, the filter material is secured in a cylindrically shaped filter chamber or housing. The inlet side of the filter cartridge is located at the intake side, while the outlet side of the filter cartridge communicates with the outlet side. The intake side communicates with a fan or suction inlet which is formed by an annular-shaped air inlet chamber. The annular shaped inlet chamber is formed by an air inlet element which is connected to a cover of the filter device. The air inlet element is provided with an outer annular wall which is at a distance from the inner wall of the filter housing and which forms an annular shaped air inlet chamber or chamber. The inlet side of the filter cartridge which is spaced from the intake side of the air filter device is provided with air outlet channels which communicate with a circular-cylindrical-shaped space within the filter housing, which space is provided with an air outlet element or air outlet fan. The outlet channels open into this circular-cylindrical-shaped space or space between the inner and outer wall of the air inlet chamber or chamber. The air intake channel in the inner wall of the inlet chamber is provided with a large number of tangential air inlet openings which communicate with the inlet channel, which is in turn formed as an annular or cylindrical channel.
In order to generate the required tangential air flow, there is provided at least one baffle element or vane which is made in one piece and is arranged in the annular shaped inlet chamber or the annular-shaped air inlet chamber. This annular shaped inlet chamber, viewed in radial section, extends into the interior of the air filter device. Accordingly, there is no connection between the air inlet chamber and the space between the inner and outer wall of the air filter device.
Thus, the air filter device which is disclosed in the above mentioned German Published Patent Application No. DE-OS 2,556,943 has the advantage that it is capable of being used in large air quantities and for long periods of time without the danger of having dust accumulation due to the fact that the dust particles are caught by the filter material and therefore are not present on the baffle elements. The drawback of this heretofore known air filter device, however, resides in that it cannot be used in all kinds of filter devices. In particular, it cannot be used in the previously described filter devices for internal combustion engines, because the latter do not have an annular shaped air inlet chamber. Additionally, there is a major danger of dirt being deposited on the annular shaped air inlet chamber or space in the area of the outer wall.
An object of the present invention is to construct a filter device for removing dust and particles from the air, especially soot and smoke particles, in such a manner that it is suitable for a large range of air filter devices. In particular, an air filter device of this type should be able to be used in intake air filters for internal combustion engines.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:35
