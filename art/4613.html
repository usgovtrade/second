Verizon Wireless is one of the potential buyers that has been looked at. As with any deal, it isn’t done until it’s done, but everything points to a sale.

That was enough to get Sprint CEO Dan Hesse to tweet some more information about the rumors, as well as saying that the company is keeping their fingers crossed that this sale goes through.

“We continue to listen, are keeping our fingers crossed and working hard on executing our strategy.”

The CEO at MetroPCS also responded to the rumors saying that a sale would be bad for the consumer.

“T-Mobile is a great company. A sale of the Company would be bad for the consumer. A sale of the Company requires a transaction which would result in substantially all of MetroPCS’s wireless spectrum being sold. A sale of the Company would result in substantially higher prices for the consumer.”

I guess the only thing left to do now is wait and see if this deal actually happens.
