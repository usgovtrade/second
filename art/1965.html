<p>The other part of my strategy is to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhanks">seek out opportunities to share my writing</a>. I have worked as a copywriter in two jobs, and I love that part of my job. I have also written a few blog posts that are on my own Web site, mostly related to teaching. I try to post new blog content every 2 weeks. <a href="http://www.matthewwoodward.com/"><img class="align-right" src="http://api.ning.com:80/files/7t6Xf*lOq-7dO-Ft0S3e9pEaUjJ5gw1X4IwW4*xV*RcJrbf2*S4VWrjyZSXUlnzqH0u*lK-XzDULaow6xYK7-V4zD/Woodward+Blog.JPG?width=350" width="350" height="266"/></a> </p>
<p>My writing has helped me a lot with self-promotion. Most people who come across my work for the first time hear it from a friend. Friends and colleagues are usually intrigued to hear about my work, but I always say I would like to write a book (or a blog post) about <em>this</em>. I often end up getting emails like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="align-center" src="http://api.ning.com:80/files/7t6Xf*s2Uv*DyvX*u*hA6iT7yMqfP*aF4X8kH5wN1l5-vZsRi-QyUwJN4uONnQxNr2kS2bB1nZY5iN9aCwq2zD/Image4.png" width="600"/></p>
<p>The key is knowing what I’m talking about and what kind of books I write.</p>
<p>What I have not yet figured out is how to reach people who aren’t already familiar with me and what I do. I think we tend to reach people who have a shared interest or passion. But that is not always true for many writers. My writing interests lie in artificial intelligence, and sometimes that can lead to some strange conversations. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-kleinbart">Tom Kedden</a> just wrote a <a href="http://tomkd.blogspot.com/">great post about this</a>, because he said his students would ask him, “What do you do?” and he didn’t really know how to answer. </p>
<p>Another question I get often is, “Is it OK for me to interview you?” I usually say yes. I’ve worked with quite a few journalists and I would rather they take the time to learn a little bit more about me than worry about asking for permission.</p>
<p>It has been a big help to have a business card that lists my Web site and Twitter handle, and maybe a brief description of what I do. This also helps people keep track of my business cards when we are networking.</p>
<p>How do you do it?</p>

<p>Many people think of social media as purely a tool for entertainment, and even to some degree a distraction. That was certainly the perspective I had as a graduate student about 10 years ago. Even now, I'm still hesitant to make any real effort in this direction.</p>
