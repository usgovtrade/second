Instead 
of turning you would not have known what hit you and you would have been found 
on the road dead with a baseball bat right beside your body. 
If not for the kindness of the police and courts you would be in that place 
today instead of all the nice things you've heard me talk about. 
It was an extremely rough spot for my family. 
And all you need to remember the way he approached people was, "If I can't get 
'em with force, I'll get 'em with fear." 
And he used his knowledge of how to intimidate. 
And it caused him a lot of difficulty. 
I remember the first time we met he showed me a bunch of pictures of different 
people he had shot or beaten up. 
He told me that this was the man that beat him up, this is the man that got the 
better of him. 
He said, "That's me." 
The reason he had kept this little piece of paper up was he was proud of how he 
beat this man up and how he got the better of him. 
I had to help this man walk again. 
Not because I felt sorry for him, I felt sorry for him because he lived. 
I felt sorry for him because he was my brother and I was his brother. 
He had a terrible disease called Parkinson's disease. 
A man who has that disease would say he has as much right to walk around and 
enjoy life as anybody else. 
And anybody who would get in his way he would beat the hell out of 'em. 
He would break in their faces, he'd put them down for good. 
I had seen him carry an elderly lady down the street as if she were so much 
trash. 
I found out that he was her son. 
He had taken her to the bus stop in the morning and he had beat her to death. 
He had gone out into the street to get his paper that night, she was down on the 
sidewalk. 
And he had come up and put his big ol' foot on her face and said, "Get up old 
lady, I got to go get my paper." 
And it was at that moment the police came and he ran out. 
He started running down the street. 
They said, "Put the old lady down." 
They put her down. 
She was a little shorter than him. 
They put her down and he said, "No I won't!" 
He took off running, they said, "Don't run. 
Stop him." 
And they said, "You can't run, your legs will give way." 
So he turned around and ran back and he said, "I had to help her up, I didn't 
mean to." 
I knew that. 
And he said, "I would have walked her across the street and got the paper." 
And he gave me every one of those pictures. 
This one was a police officer that he had beaten up and he told me that this 
man had made his wife cry. 
And he didn't care that he was a police officer, he hit him over the head with a 
gun and he knocked him out and that's the first time he went to jail. 
And there was a doctor who had him committed. 
And I can't say that was true but he believed it. 
We went to jail over the summer. 
We went to jail over the Christmas holidays. 
He started talking to the other inmates. 
And the next thing we knew we got a Christmas card. 
He talked to my brothers, he talked to my mother and he said, "I've been telling 
all of you how important this is, this card is to tell all of you that I was right. 
We were right, we did the right thing. 
I'm going back to that jail again, I'm gonna be locked up for a long time. 
And you know something, you guys didn't help me out of it." 
And that was the way he talked. 
He never told me he was sorry for what he had done. 
He told me there were two sides to the story that I didn't hear. 
Now I know there's only one side to the story. 
Now I know. 
What you're gonna do is look back on what was said, what we did and we did the 
right thing by protecting the law enforcement officers who were on duty that 
night. 
I can tell you that I will never, I will never get over it. 
If I'm ever elected sheriff of Cook County there will be a sign on the side of 
the wall that says, "This side is dedicated to Detective Gorman. 
To the men who fought for it, for the men who lost it." 
They can hang a sign over that. 
I don't need a sign to remind me of what happened to me that night. 
You may think you're one of those people who are just being quiet and you didn't 
know this is what was going on or you didn't know that, but believe me there were 
hundreds of thousands of people in the city of Chicago at that time that went 
through exactly what I went through. 
And the same is true for those officers. 
Just because you're not down in a neighborhood doesn't mean you don't know 
about it. 
And it's not enough to say it didn't happen where you are. 
Anybody here who doesn't understand what I'm talking about in the world right 
now is the one with the problem. 
There are some things that we just don't share. 
I'm gonna say what I'm going to say. 
When I see the pictures, the first thing I want you to see is a big 
vulnerable man and you're thinking he has his gun out. 
And he's pointing it in your face, you're dead. 
You don't ever forget that moment. 
You have no choice but to be helpless. 
You can't walk away. 
You can't run away from it. 
It happened right there. 
You're helpless. 
If you don't feel pain you can still feel helpless. 
And you don't need to be down on the street with one of them in your face. 
You see somebody with his gun out in front of you it just doesn't matter how big 
and strong you are. 
They might know you're an innocent bystander. 
They might think you're a threat to them. 
And they're going to shoot. 
All you've got to do is be there to tell that story. 
I told my wife that if I die, so be it, I had my say. 
It's not gonna be for nothing. 
And it's gonna save people's lives. 
You never forget it. 
To be able to hear somebody go, "Don't run," and you hear somebody else go, 
"Don't go that way. 
I have a gun. 
Don't go down the alley." 
And you hear shots ring out. 
And you see somebody with a gun in your face. 
Those sounds and sights don't go away. 
It's something we don't share. 
Don't underestimate the influence of the media. 
A lot of people think police brutality is a Hollywood story. 
It's a dirty little secret. 
People think, "Oh, they put cameras in the faces of police officers. 
They think they're out to get us." 
And we go on TV and we say this is our job. 
We do what we have to do. 
We don't have any problem sharing what we do. 
When we go on the front page of the paper it's the news. 
When we say, "No comment," that's the news. 
They think it's all a game, a show. 
This is not the show. 
This is the real deal. 
They think it's only happening in a few places in the country. 
They think that what we do is this. 
They think this is only happening in a few cities in the country. 
They think it's only a problem here. 
And it is a problem here. 
It's not just me, it's everybody. 
Every city in the country has these problems. 
The minute we start to deny this it's something we're hiding, we're ashamed of. 
We don't talk about it enough. 
You're either gonna tell your story or you're gonna lie. 
And you know what that makes you? 
A liar. 
We are not just talking about being a witness to a tragedy, but a liar, too. 
The sad thing about this, if somebody had a problem with their attitude, 
they don't call the airline and say, "My pilot has got a problem with his 
attitude.
