Instead 
of being like,
"Hey, man. Cool it down. I'm not mad."
I was like,
"Oh shit. I'm the fucking bad guy here."
Right?
Right.
I'm like, "I don't care that 
he's just being himself.
I'm just being like,
"Yo, yo, yo, yo. You don't like? Okay.
Get the fuck out of here."
You know?
It was just like,
"Why do you even fucking matter?
He can't choose his 
own music anyways."
Right?
Yeah,
but you know what?
I realized that I
was being a hypocrite.
So,
I stopped.
I stopped.
You know what I mean?
I realized that.
I'm all in.
I'm all in.
That's when you know
you're done.
You're done.
You know what I mean?
We just saw a clip, so...
you know?
Now,
I really do think that
he should have shut the 
fuck up.
But I really do love
anybody that I
I
fucking admire.
Um.
You know what I mean?
I wouldn't be sitting here.
I just feel that.
You know what I mean?
I think that that's, you know,
one of those good people.
You know what I mean?
A lot of kids these days,
they get on to him 
because they can relate to him.
I'm like, "Dude, you're just
saying shit that everybody goes through."
You know what I mean?
That's a universal thing,
but they see somebody
that they look like,
that they want to be.
That's what this whole
Tupac-Chronicling documentary was about.
That's what that was about.
He's fucking real.
You know what I mean?
And I think that's so admirable.
And fuck you.
You can say whatever you want to me.
I got a fucking big mouth.
You know what I mean?
I'm gonna say what 
the fuck I want to say.
But what's important to me
is that you feel what I feel.
You know what I mean?
I don't feel like you don't.
I just feel like you haven't,
or you haven't gotten to
that level of feeling like me,
or that level of feeling like,
"Fuck this shit."
You know what I mean?
That's what I'm saying.
I think when you're done,
you know you're done.
And I think for the first time,
I saw what I could have been.
I was like, "Wow.
This is so cool."
And I'm so glad that 
I got out of that spot,
that I'm still here today.
And I appreciate everybody
that keeps me going.
I know a lot of my music.
That's all I know is
all the stuff I write about.
I can appreciate that shit.
I don't get the respect that I should,
but I do appreciate it.
Okay?
And,
that's not even like on a level
of what I'm trying to say,
but that's just the truth.
I feel that.
You know what I mean?
And it's nothing but love.
Okay?
Thanks.
So,
the first clip was like a bit of it.
He got me where he wanted me,
but then I realized
how I was falling for this.
Okay?
So,
when you realize it,
you get right back up.
You know?
As a man,
like I said,
I wouldn't be 
standing up here today.
And I think that's why 
I'm one of the few men
in the business that I feel like
I can stand up here.
I can do what I do and
talk about certain things
that a lot of
a lot of women can't.
They get a lot more backlash than I do.
So, that's the thing.
I'm so glad I can stay
because you need that guy
to stand up for you.
You need that man 
that you know
that will stay in there for you.
Not try to get you where he wants to.
And I just don't feel like 
there's any men that can do it.
Any men that can do it
and the guys who do do it
are usually like,
"Well, just let's make it
more like women's music."
That's what they always say.
It's like,
"Okay. That's your opinion.
Cool.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll go with you.
That sounds great.
I like women's music."
That's what they're 
always thinking about.
I'm like, "No."
Okay?
And you know why they want
to turn it into a women's thing?
Because,
"That's what sells."
You know what I mean?
I'm like, "That's not the 
thing to be thinking about.
I'm just saying,
that's not the way to make it.
You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it
into a women's thing
like that."
Why are you so worried
about fucking selling it?
Just keep it
a little edgier,
a little more mature.
Don't hold back with nothing.
Don't hold back
with nothing, okay?
Don't be like,
"Let's make it more like
a little women's thing.
People will love it
if they can see
how the women
want to be treated."
No, you know what I mean?
Women do love being 
with me,
so that's why I stay.
You know what I mean?
Don't go with the popular opinion.
Don't do what 
the people are thinking.
Don't go with the crowd.
Find that man that 
you can stand up for.
Don't get emotional with it.
Say what you want to say,
but don't be emotional about it.
Emotional situations
never worked for me.
You know what I mean?
I get emotional a little.
I get emotional.
But don't start
wrestling with emotion.
That's for the people
that get off on that shit.
You know what I mean?
You know how you know
something is serious?
You get outraged by the situation.
That's when you know
something is fucking crazy.
That's when you know
that it's serious.
You know what I mean?
That's what emotion is.
For example,
if you want to get really upset,
that's what it is.
It's like,
"What the fuck?
This is crazy. This is crazy."
You know what I mean?
And that's what being
emotional is.
You know what I mean?
But don't cry when you're sad.
That's not how we get out.
Okay?
Don't cry because 
you feel something.
Okay?
Crying because you feel something
doesn't really do shit for you.
That's not how you get out of that.
You have to do the opposite.
You have to be that confident.
You have to show that confidence.
That's how you do that.
Like, "I don't give a shit."
You know?
You have to act like,
"Shit is fucked up, okay?
This is what's going on."
And like, you can't keep that shit in.
That's the shit that builds
up in your head.
You have to let it go.
You have to let it go
and you have to
be the opposite of emotion.
You know what I mean?
Like,
don't let people get to you,
no matter what they're
saying to you.
They can say anything,
but they can't get in your head.
They can't get in your head.
You know what I mean?
That's what you have to 
just remember.
That's what you have to keep in mind.
I've seen so many
man fall apart 
because they were emotional.
They didn't realize
that they were emotional.
I've seen people
cry over a fucking shoe.
You know what I mean?
Why would someone cry over a shoe?
You know?
And it's stupid shit.
It's not fucking nothing.
It's nothing.
Right?
Don't go there.
Don't fall for it.
Don't fall for it.
That's another thing.
Don't fall for it.
No one will cry over you.
They</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:05
