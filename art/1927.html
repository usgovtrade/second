I'm a mid-level web developer with a wide variety of skill sets. My passion
for building web apps and working with entrepreneurs to drive the user
experience have led me to join the ranks of IndieHackers, launching the Austin
Community Directory and then moving to launching IndieHackers Austin. I am a
generalist and enjoy getting involved with building the right tool for the
job. I'm open to new ideas and love iterating on the process.

no experience with Z80 (yet).

I'm passionate about both writing software and teaching others how to write
software. I've got experience writing software from both sides of the
process--working at a startup and working in industry on a team of 3-10. I'm
seeking a full-time position as a developer or team lead where I can work on a
team of great people and make a difference in the software we make. I love
learning new technologies so I'm not afraid to work on something new or
difficult as long as I have good communication skills and people to support me
when needed.
