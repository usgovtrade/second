A few words on my book…

In 27 Days… I outline how you can bring fresh energy to the everyday by learning how to set yourself up to be as productive and fulfilled as possible. These new strategies help you to make daily choices that allow you to be truly happy with your life now and in the future – without having to wait for anything.

Here are just a few things that I discovered in the process of writing this book

I was surprised by how simple it was to create change.

You can make this big change in your life even if you think you have nothing in common with the person that has led you to think that way.

I was surprised by how big an impact mindset has on our happiness and success.

The first part of the book lays out simple yet powerful strategies for creating a life of satisfaction. We then cover how to identify exactly what you need to focus on and what to let go of. There is some practical advice about how to make goals tangible and how to ensure that the right time will come for every project. The book then goes on to cover the key strategies you need to know to implement your intentions into action. You will also find out how to bring more success into your life by thinking positively and using your brain power for effective outcomes. Finally, we will find out about the top ways to bring about new levels of clarity and purpose in your life.

I would love to know what you think about my book

I would like to extend a very special invitation for all of you to a special weekend event I am co-hosting with one of my all time favourite mentors, Lisa Petrone.

This is what Lisa has to say about her upcoming event

As the title suggests, this year’s event is all about finding our inspiration. We’ve put together a weekend that’ll help you to get in touch with your inner light, discover what you’re here to do and reconnect with your purpose so that you can truly live a happy, fulfilling life.

The weekend will start with a guided relaxation on Saturday morning, and a reconnection with your inner light.

Then on Sunday, I’ll be talking you through the 5 practices that are so important to help you find your true purpose in life.

How would you like to celebrate the start of a new season and discover what is special about YOU?

Join us on 15 and 16 September 2015, at the stunning Marriott Hotel and Conference Centre in Nottingham from 9am – 4pm.
