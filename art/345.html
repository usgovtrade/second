will make you suffer.

SOREL
I will be glad to be released from this place.

MARTHA
I did not come here to give an order.

ROGER
I did not ask for it.

MARTHA
I will not let myself be abused.

ROGER
I am quite sure you will not.

MARTHA
I will be sent back to England, and you will be punished.

ROGER
Very well. I will suffer.

MARTHA
No!

MARTHA _begins to make towards the door, but_ ROGER _restrains her._

ROGER
I am not beaten yet. You came in uninvited.

MARTHA
And how shall I enter?

ROGER
If I am not the man I was, you do not enter.

MARTHA
I had forgotten that.

MARTHA _begins to cry._

ROGER
Have you come to make fun of me? Is that it?

MARTHA
It is not right.

ROGER
Is that the only way you can make fun of me?

MARTHA
It is not right.

ROGER
Then what way is it right?

MARTHA
The right way is not to treat me like this.

ROGER
You think I am treating you badly.

MARTHA
Yes.

ROGER
No, you do not. You lie.

MARTHA
When I speak the truth I lie.

ROGER
And I? Have I come to tell you the truth?

MARTHA
Is that what you are trying to do?

ROGER
Why do you come here to tell me lies? Is that what you think
I need?

MARTHA
You are like a father.

ROGER
Your father does not beat you?

MARTHA
No.

ROGER
Ah! It is you who beat me. If you took my place, you'd probably
be beating me too.

MARTHA
That is what you want me to say.

ROGER
Is it not what you think?

MARTHA
I don't think.

ROGER
Would you like to?

MARTHA
No.

ROGER
Good. You will find out when I am gone.

MARTHA
I would not dare, even if it was so.

ROGER
Then sit down and talk.

MARTHA
I am sorry.

ROGER
Will you have some wine?

MARTHA
No.

ROGER
Then sit down and talk. We do not have to talk about me.

MARTHA
I am sorry.

ROGER
Sit down. The seat is over there. It is still warm from
yesterday. You have only to stretch out your legs, to make the
warmth go away.

MARTHA
But I am used to my own room, and I would not be happy in this
place.

ROGER
This is not your place. This is my house. And you must put up
with it.

MARTHA
It would be good if I could go away.

ROGER
Sit down.

MARTHA
Thank you. I was afraid of sitting down.

ROGER
It was not an apology. I do not ask for apologies. But I know
you had something to say.

MARTHA
I had nothing.

ROGER
You had. I could tell you to go if I wanted.

MARTHA
I could not do that.

ROGER
Of course you could.

MARTHA
It would be easier for you to go, than to have me go.

ROGER
It is not so.

MARTHA
It is true. I am tired, and when I am tired I cannot think.

ROGER
You have come here to think.

MARTHA
You cannot talk to me about the weather.

ROGER
What then?

MARTHA
You think you are the only person in the world.

ROGER
No.

MARTHA
Then you are the first.

ROGER
No.

MARTHA
Then you are the only person.

ROGER
It is not so. I am alone, yes. But you are like me.

MARTHA
You are nothing like me.

ROGER
I know that I am not. I was lucky, but there are some that are
even luckier.

MARTHA
You talk about me as though I was a machine that you work.

ROGER
I talk about myself in the same way. If I can.

MARTHA
And is it so much trouble to speak about yourself?

ROGER
Sometimes. But you have to tell me all about you, too.

MARTHA
I am sorry.

ROGER
Then tell me.

MARTHA
I was not brought up to do that.

ROGER
And what does that mean?

MARTHA
That you could not do it.

ROGER
Who could not do what?

MARTHA
You could not do it either.

ROGER
I would not expect to be told anything about you.

MARTHA
And that is why you are so unhappy, and I am so happy.

ROGER
You know nothing about me.

MARTHA
I do know something.

ROGER
Then I wish you would tell me.

MARTHA
What would you like to know?

ROGER
Your life is a tragedy.

MARTHA
But if I tell you it will make it a tragedy.

ROGER
But if I ask you, you will tell me.

MARTHA
Perhaps I will. But do you promise me you will forgive me if I
do not tell you anything?

ROGER
Yes.

MARTHA
You will not think badly of me for not saying anything?

ROGER
How can you know that?

MARTHA
I think you must know a great deal, to treat me like this.

ROGER
If you think that I am able to control what I think of you, you
are mistaken.

MARTHA
It is too late to do anything. I must be patient.

ROGER
If I had wanted to control you I should have married you, not
sent you away.

MARTHA
That would have been more comfortable.

ROGER
And more satisfying for me?

MARTHA
And more satisfying for me.

ROGER
For one day, yes. But for the rest of my life?

MARTHA
There is no other way.

ROGER
No other way?

MARTHA
Only this.

ROGER
But there are other ways.

MARTHA
If you think so.

ROGER
You do not agree?

MARTHA
No.

ROGER
You cannot be very happy. You are lying in wait. You have come
to tell me you want to stay here with me.

MARTHA
I told you that?

ROGER
You did not say you wanted to stay here. But that is what you
have come to tell me.

MARTHA
How do you know?

ROGER
You are right, you have no sense of fun, you tell me about
people.

MARTHA
The only people I have to do with are Mr. Sorrel, and him
sometimes his daughters.

ROGER
Who are they?

MARTHA
And you. And Roger.

ROGER
How do I compare with him? You must choose.

MARTHA
Not like him.

ROGER
Why not?

MARTHA
He has something in him, I do not know what.

ROGER
Has he?

MARTHA
I have seen them. I am not so happy as you think.

ROGER
What do you want?

MARTHA
I want to get away from Mr. Sorrel, and everything.

ROGER
But what else do you want?

MARTHA
That I do not know.

ROGER
To know.

MARTHA
Yes.

ROGER
You are unhappy.

MARTHA
Yes.

ROGER
But you do not know what you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:26
