For a girl who’s been told her whole life she’s not pretty enough, having your best friend call you a fake, and a million other things...that were actually true, this was the perfect way to prove her ex wrong. At least on paper. But having her dream of marrying the richest man in the world come true for all the wrong reasons left her reeling. When he told her what a fake she was, she was devastated and her ego was seriously wounded. It’s safe to say that not everyone is happy about her sudden marriage. But what’s a man to do when there’s a woman he doesn’t trust in his bed at night? No one. The minute he sees her in all her hot, little, black, lace, lingerie he’s on to her fake ways. But when his real fiancée is killed by a mugger, all bets are off! He decides she’s his chance at happiness, so he turns her into the person she never knew she was and makes her the star she’s always wanted to be.
