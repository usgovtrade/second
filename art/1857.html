The first cord blood stem cells transplant was done in 1988 by Dr. Thomas A. Upton, professor of medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has since been used in almost every country in the world.

There are many types of transplant medicine available. There are also new and developing transplant treatments. Each treatment is different and involves various methods of administration. Each transplant patient's situation is unique and best suited to a specific treatment. Some patients require combination treatments, and each treatment itself is tailored to a specific disease.

The patient and family need to ask many questions. Information regarding other available treatments, including alternative medicine, should be discussed. The patient must be willing to undergo the transplant with informed consent. The patient will receive a thorough explanation of the possible side effects. They will also be informed of the risk of relapse after the transplantation is complete.

The healthy stem cells in the donor's marrow replace the diseased marrow of the recipient. A donor can be a family member, friend or an unrelated donor. For more information, click here.
