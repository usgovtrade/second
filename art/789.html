Instead icing sugar mixed with water was used to coat the panes and windows to keep away the cold air.

Today: The majority of us will not experience a night this cold, but most of us will see a cold snap.

The “frost” on the panes made it clear the air was frigid

I remember being in school in the late 1970s when it was recorded as the lowest temperature ever recorded in January at -40 degrees Celsius. To the north that winter temperature felt like a heatwave. It’s a different story altogether today, because in the northern hemisphere more of us are used to, and expect, temperatures colder than that.

So don’t count on the cold snap being a major event. But if you’re in a northern country and are used to or expecting the cold, please take a moment to appreciate the good that cold weather does: it helps prevent many illnesses, it makes our snow (and sometimes our slush, our ice and our wind) more fun to play in, and it might help prevent a frost – and help us remember frosty nights to come.

So the next time you’re in the cold and wondering whether a winter cold snap is on the way, remember that the cold has done its work well over the centuries, and that some of the northern hemisphere’s biggest cities are used to temperatures below freezing.

In any case, enjoy the cold as much as you can! It helps us feel warm inside.

We still have a couple of days left of January, and while February has just started, some people will find February’s early arrival is a welcome change from January’s longer days.

Today is the first day of what we in the southern hemisphere call the spring equinox, when days and nights become about equal length. People who take their holidays in the middle of winter will find the coming of February more than a welcome sight; it’s a reminder that it’s time to pack up their winter gear and pack their bags and go.

Spring Equinox in the Southern Hemisphere: In Australia, the southern hemisphere’s spring equinox actually comes in January

Today’s date is an equinox. But remember, in the northern hemisphere winter starts on March 1, so it’s an equinox in the southern hemisphere for those living in the northern hemisphere in winter. (You may have to click the link to see the two hemispheres’ equinox dates).

For us in the northern hemisphere, today’s equinox is a reminder that our long days will fade and become shorter again as we continue to head towards June 21, the longest day of the year, where the northern hemisphere has the longest day of the year and the southern hemisphere has the shortest day. And there’s another equinox to remember for us there, at the end of summer.

But back to our midwinter spring equinox, the day when the southern hemisphere is experiencing spring. The midwinter solstice marks the midpoint between the summer solstice and the winter solstice. This year the solstice is just before sunset at 23:34, and the full moon is just before sunrise (both on the 16th). I hope you have good company to celebrate.
