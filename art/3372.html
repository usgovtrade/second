This book has a good bit to say about abortion and homosexuality, but it is no more specific than that. However, Hauerwas is a Christian ethicist who tries to justify Christian teaching against homosexuality in terms of human dignity, an ethical argument at least as old as Plato. He is the foremost philosopher of religious liberty in the United States in recent years, and in his book he argues that this should go further than mere respect for individual liberty in his field, which it sometimes has. It is a political liberty rather than an individual liberty.

Feminist Voices: Locating Women in Public and Private Domains by Susan E. Church. This book is more political than moral. Church’s main interest is to find out what is a feminist’s political agenda and how it ought to apply to women in various kinds of public and private life, be it military service, the police, or pornography.


In the Heart of the Beast by Susan Nieman. This is an unusual book. It is a case study in how a woman who is a Christian and a professor of history can go through her experience as a professor at the City College of New York.

In his final letter to those of his parishioners who would be persecuted for their faith during the Crusades, St. Bernard of Clairvaux said, “I saw a great battle taking place. In one corner stood the Lord Jesus Christ, in the other were the kings of earth and their followers. There is no possible comparison. In one corner is faith in God; in the other is all the wisdom and skill of men.”
