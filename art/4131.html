Well thats a longshot lol
It is not good enough to be one of the best you have to be THE best if you want to be a world champion. You have to look at the guys out there and be proud at least that no one is better.
I dont have that pride in myself any more. I like my job but I cant take any pride in that. Its just work.
Im just wondering what you are able to work with? (ex. you would NEVER be a welder)

That's the thing, it's not that you can't be one of the best, it's that you don't HAVE to be one of the best to have a great career. Some of the greatest pro athletes in sports didn't even have pro sports on their radar when they started out. It really depends on how YOU want to be perceived. If you want to be an auto-industry icon (not saying that's bad), then yeah, take your chances. Just don't expect to get paid the same amount as someone who has 10 times your experience and is killing it for their profession.

My name is Michael Le, I am from Taiwan and I think I am good in welding,I want to study in one of your school.

Please can you tell me the different between "Cleveland Ohio Technical Center" and "AWS",which one is better ?

It's good to know that people would still study from your school.

Yes I'm sure that I'm good in welding. What should I choose?

AWS or Cleveland Ohio Technical Center ?

AWS has more training courses. Cleveland Technical Center only offers one course, the C.O.T.C. course.

If you want to do other things in welding besides just welding jobs, AWS would be the better choice. If you plan to be in construction or aerospace, AWS would be the way to go. I would also look at their facilities. Some of their facilities are amazing, some not so much. I'd recommend it.

AWS is good choice for you. The place you should learn welding is AWS!!! We had a lot of students from Asia came to us from Taiwan. Many have gone to AWS and have started as good as they are now..

I hope you find this information useful. I have some other things I need to take care of now. Have a good day.

If you have not yet done a practical at AWS, go to C.O.T.C. Because AWS does not have the best reputation in the business, they are just starting out and most places will not hire them until there is more experience in their program.

Thank you. You give a lot of useful information for students.
What’s your thought about AWS in Taiwan? There are so many choice for me to choose. My work is in the oil field. Who is familiar with this? I will need for the skill to do the practical exam and the interview exam. Is there anyone who can answer these questions in detail? I need for the advice. Thanks a lot.

The only school I know of that offers AWS and C.O.T.C. in Taiwan is Taiwan Technical Institute. All the guys that I work with are from Taiwan and most of them went there. C.O.T.C. is a very good school for hands on work (most importantly for me is the hands on work). It is very good on the theory too, the training is also very good for us to train students in welding. AWS has a lot of courses for students to learn from. My recommendation is the C.O.T.C. course because the hands on part (hands on work, practical exam) will be very good for students to learn welding. But AWS is really good in all the other areas (training, theory, practical exam, curriculum). I have not gone there to teach but I believe that the teachers are all good but I have not met a lot of them but I can believe them to be good.

Thanks,you can be my teacher.
I will take a lot of C.O.T.C. classes next month and get ready for the practical exam. I also will take a hands on training course and start to get ready for the interview.
Which person should you recommend me to get some hands on training?

Go to the best place you can find for hands on training. Go to as many as you can. Try to talk to your instructors and let them know you need the hands on training. Go to AWS and talk to the instructor for AWS. Take that hands on training. I can understand that you do not want to go there, but if you want the hands on training, go there.

Do you have the school address for COTC? I would love to learn more about COTC and if they offer online classes. Thank you.

Thanks for the help. I believe they do not have online class. If they did, this would be a great help for me as it would take a lot of time to travel to Taiwan. Just contact them by email. They do not have any online class at this moment. I'll be glad to assist.
