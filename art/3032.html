But We're on To Something
(Sunny)
I See Them Telling Everybody
(Sunny)
That This Is The Last Time,
(Sunny)
Let's Make This Last For All Time
(Repeat Chorus)

The Days We Had,
I'm Scared To Look Back At The Good Times,
I Just Feel Stuck In A Dream,
I Can't Forget,
I'm So Scared Of These Days Gone By,
I'm Scared To Look Back At The Good Times,
