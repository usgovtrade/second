He said the same thing happened to other well-known figures in Silicon Valley including Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg.

Musk says that the files were used to spy on him and used to hurt Tesla in the past.



Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Monday made a claim that could shed light on the investigation into a group of individuals that allegedly stole personal and confidential files from Silicon Valley giants.

Musk tweeted that a hacker who goes by the online alias "th3j35t3r" had stolen 5.3 gigabytes of his personal files from Musk's iCloud. Musk explained that the hacker had released some of the files online and used them against him "for financial gain, to hurt me and for personal pleasure."

After I contacted Apple for a recommendation, they pushed hard for me to get an iPhone as my only phone. This was despite my desire to continue using Android & phone freedom.

Aside from the fact that the files were stolen from Musk's iCloud, there were other indications that they may have been stolen by a hacker, as the files were allegedly targeted at members of the technology sector.

Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has said he was hit by a hacker who used to work at Tesla, where Musk is now the chairman, and SpaceX, according to Business Insider. Musk wrote on Twitter: "This is not the first time this has happened to me. I’ve had similar experiences in the past."

A hacker who goes by the online alias "th3j35t3r" in January threatened the SpaceX founder with online harassment. Musk then replied that he "got the better of this guy."

The hacker has also appeared to threaten Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Musk's friend and Tesla board member.

The hacker has been the target of criticism for some of his alleged actions against Musk. In 2016, a video of the hacker hacking into a website of the US national nuclear laboratory and reportedly claiming that there were flaws in its emergency shutdown system was uploaded to YouTube.

On March 8, Musk tweeted that a Tesla employee's wife had been kidnapped and was in danger. The employee quickly responded that he was not sure if the employee had been kidnapped and that he wasn't sure where he was based on Musk's statement.

Musk then sent a Twitter message to say that he was joking, but after deleting the tweet, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that an employee was investigated after the tweet was deleted.

The spokesperson said: "We take these types of posts very seriously and we are investigating the situation as we do any complaint about the conduct of our employees."

Musk has been a billionaire many times over before even starting his career in tech. He was previously a businessman best known for the financial management firm he founded with his brother, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and the early funding of Tesla.

Musk quit the company in 2008 and the firm filed a lawsuit against Musk, claiming he misappropriated company secrets. He is now the chairman of Tesla and a director at the company.

Musk has made $22 billion, according to Forbes.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:39
