I also like the smell and the texture, but I find it has the consistency of whipped cream. However, it doesn’t seem to have the same calorie count as the real whipped cream. Just a side note!

This may also help you figure out how many ounces are in a can of coconut milk. The answer: 15! (The US uses four-ounce containers.) This is perfect for one day of a small portion of ice cream, or some other dish you want to dress up. I found it a little too watery to be used as real whipped cream.

I wanted to have some with a cupcake, and was very sad when I realized that they have long since sold out! But just use regular whipped cream from a can of chilled coconut milk in a can. It’s perfect for decorating and looks great on your cupcakes!

Tips: Do not drink this if you are dairy-intolerant.

Dairy-free/vegan friendly but you can still taste the “flavor”

I found the texture of the ice cream was perfect, almost as creamy as the real stuff. You’ll be surprised to see that this is very sweet, but it has less calories than regular ice cream.

As a side note, you may have a question if you’ve never seen a can of coconut milk. This is my own way of preserving coconut milk because I never cook with it, and store it as is. That means there’s still a can of coconut milk in the fridge if you don’t want to buy it for that night’s dinner. 🙂 You might also want to know how much one can is. A US quart is around 30 ounces, and a US pint is around half of a can.

If you would like a full serving of frozen yogurt, pour the mix into your bowl, turn the machine on, and start eating it as soon as the machine turns off! 🙂

Just a warning: We’ve been eating it for a week or so now and it tastes fantastic. (Not a lot of people in my house can finish an entire bowl of ice cream.) My husband even ate the little leftovers after mixing up more, but when I told him it was low calorie I saw a skeptical look in his eyes. He said “Just how low is this?” I replied “You would have to eat a lot of them for the calories.” We all know if you eat ice cream you need the calories! This ice cream mix is much lower in calories, so you don’t have to watch what you’re eating!

I do want to say that I did have this in a bowl with lots of chopped pecans. I am allergic to coconut and almonds and this gave me a really good taste that I miss without them. It also makes a nice frozen yogurt on its own and will save the coconut milk for another use. It was a nice treat to have with no “bad” sugar added and no chemicals. I will say this is not like real yogurt in texture. If you really love ice cream, this is a great alternative to make at home.

I would like to make this ice cream in the fridge, especially as a substitute for ice cream and in the middle of the summer, and I am not dairy-free. Can you tell me what to do with the can?
This site has a lot of great information! Thanks for making it available for us!

I made the vanilla on a whim… but it worked out great! It was not too sweet and had all the flavor you want from vanilla ice cream. It was great over yogurt and is really delicious over vanilla yogurt.

I’ve been trying to find a recipe for Vegan ice cream that I could eat all of and didn’t have to share or give away to friends so I finally decided to make this one up myself. I just didn’t get that flavor of ice cream I was looking for (vanilla) and in addition it was way too sweet. I think you can taste the ingredients or the sugar itself. I’ve had better vegan ice creams from Trader Joe’s frozen foods (only $2 for a pint) and so did my husband. I’m going to use the milk to make soup instead because it’s so good right out of the can!

Just a caution: This stuff isn’t something I’d want to eat and feel bad about. I’m sorry you didn’t enjoy it as much as you thought you would. If you do have more, though, I’d love to know how you could improve the recipe. I like you idea of the yogurt to help disguise the taste of the mix. 🙂

I like the idea of using yogurt to “mask” the taste. I will definitely try that next time because I’m glad to know that I’ll still get the nutrition benefits of eating this ice cream without going over the top calories with ice cream. Thanks for sharing.

I just can’t make the coconut milk fat enough to make it like regular ice cream… and this is not helping to change that. I’m okay with coconut milk and maybe half of one can but the rest is really bad for me. I love your idea of freezing it for dessert (just add the yogurt instead of mixing them) though. Very helpful. 🙂

I added a tablespoon of sugar free caramel to it just to bring it up to the level I like, but we didn’t notice a real change in the taste. We probably did mix it in wrong though, because it was too clumpy. Maybe we should have whipped it longer… I will try again with fewer ice creams this time, and add a tablespoon of yogurt to it and see what happens!

Thank you so much for this post!! I am dairy free and my mom also has celiac disease and I was looking for a way for her to make frozen yogurt with no milk, and this is exactly what I was looking for. I made this yesterday, and I just let her stir it when she got home from school. She and I just sat down on the couch and shared it. 🙂 I put in all the little chocolate kisses we had, and she enjoyed it too!

I tried this recipe, and it came out fantastic! A huge success for my dad, as he loves chocolate and has never liked vegan ice cream.

I used half a small can of coconut milk (just enough to cover the bottom of my ice cream tray) and an entire small can of almond milk. I did not add the sweetener because I was using vanilla bean paste, which already adds sweetness, but there are additional options I plan to try out as well.

I did add unsweetened cocoa powder to give it a chocolate “hint.”

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. It’s amazing and I think I will make it again with different flavors/options to try out.

I also recently made this recipe and I’m sorry to say that it tasted like a very low quality store-bought product! My husband has always been picky and he couldn’t eat it. I think the store-bought products taste too sweet and I don’t believe that even a couple teaspoons of sugar would have been enough to get it to taste good. That being said, I found that once you add the store-bought vanilla creamer, coconut cream, etc. to this mix, the result is amazing.

[…] can now make your own plant-based frozen yogurt. If you don’t own an ice cream maker, this would be the perfect recipe to make with your own yogurt. It even has options for chocolate and mint flavors. […]</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:54:02
