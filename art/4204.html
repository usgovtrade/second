Gentlemen, Start Your Engines

In case you didn’t notice, this is a big week for technology in the Middle East. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman – kicked off their own International Innovation Week on April 1, and they’ve also thrown in some competition for the annual Geekfest celebration in Abu Dhabi.

The competition is the reason this blog (along with many others) just published a new infographic giving the top apps and brands that UAE citizens love to use.

The UAE is one of the fastest-growing mobile markets in the world, with an average smartphone penetration of over 110 percent. As a result, every app built for the Middle East is being used by more people more often than it was designed for. We looked at over 10,000 smartphone app usage data points to find the top apps by category: Gaming, Travel, Messaging, Education, Photography, Health and Fitness, Productivity, News, and Social.

The numbers paint an impressive picture of how mobile is enhancing the lives of UAE residents. From learning a new language to helping a family member abroad, from enjoying local food at home to exploring exotic destinations, smartphones and apps play a major role in helping Emiratis enrich their daily lives. We’ve seen all this before, and we’re happy to be a part of this rapidly growing market.

At Doro, we’re always looking for ways to improve our app. We’re currently working to develop apps for new uses and purposes in multiple locations. We’re also continually researching and analyzing the market for ways to make our apps better and more useful for everyone. We’re going to need a lot more app development geniuses to keep up with the demand.

Be sure to share your app experiences in the comments below or connect with us on Twitter @dorolabsinc. And if you’re attending Geekfest this weekend, stop by our booth, or stop by our sponsor, EurekaPark, to have a go-kart ride in the company of some cool creatures.

The most popular apps in the UAE, according to Doro:

With a choice of 3 different languages (English, Spanish, and French), it encourages students to practice spelling words in the language that they are learning. This helps reduce language gaps and the use of English as a second language for children.
