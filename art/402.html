But there was still more, as the show kept on going.

Next, we learned about the “Paparazi,” the people Dr. Jones described as “a bunch of guys in black leather jackets.” In the show’s timeline, he had lived just long enough to see an “interesting pattern,” and said that he was sure “they’re not just messing around anymore.” He also said, “They started to pick up steam about the end of the show back in the early 80s…it was around when we were the kids watching it. They were creepy and looked like biker gangs. The guy walking in the foreground…the only thing missing is the red and black leather jacket. So something’s definitely happened with the timing of this.”

By the time we got to this segment of the program, 小林深雪 was visibly agitated.

Next up, Dr. Jones shared the following words.

魔女の話は終わったものの…何か今の世界に似てるとこもないかもしれないですが…(Mahō no hanashi wa tsuita mou... nanika koto no koe mo nai kama-shiremasen...), “But for all the Witchcraft things…something like this could be happening here and now. But...”

The next piece of music introduced 宗霊 (Shuten Kishi), a person of great power, who is known for having appeared many times in the show’s history. He also appears on screen to introduce Dr. Jones’ story.

魔女の話は終わったものの…何か今の世界に似てるとこもないかもしれないですが… (Mahō no hanashi wa tsuita mou... nanika koto no koe mo nai kama-shiremasen...),“But for all the Witchcraft things…something like this could be happening here and now. But...”

Dr. Jones continued to try to describe the “new thing,” but the music changed to “Shuten Kishi’s” theme. Dr. Jones, with great agitation in his voice, said 「宗霊、絶対に許せない。」(Shuten Kishi, zettai ni ooki nesu-sena.), which means something like “Shuten Kishi will never forgive us.” Dr. Jones then said, “All of them! This is all connected…I think. Forget about those guys in black. This whole thing was all planned in this game I’m playing. Don’t fall for any old stuff…I’m scared, my friends. I’m just so scared.”

I’ve personally done some research on 宗霊 and the character has been described as 「神の落とし子」(kamisama no otoshi ko) or “Kami’s children,” which is a term used to describe spirits that used to be around Japan thousands of years ago when they were alive on Earth. It’s even been said 「神の霊に生まれたのだ」(kamisama no rei ni umareta no da), which means “He was born as a Kami’s Spirit,” 「幸せになる能力を持ちながら人間ではないかも」(kibou ni naru nenkoku wo motchanagara hitona nakama), or “Maybe he was a being with the power to make people happy, but maybe he isn’t human?” and 「宗霊は謎が多い」(Shuten Kishi wa muzukashi ga toraibu), which literally means “Shuten Kishi has mysteries that seem endless.” The term “mysteries that seem endless” has been used countless times in connection with UFO and alien phenomena.

This made a great deal of sense with what Dr. Jones said, 「宗霊は許しません。」(Shuten Kishi wa ooki nesu.), which means “Shuten Kishi will never forgive us.” Dr. Jones seemed to feel that if someone had taken his role in the “game,” and used that power in evil ways, then he or she could never be forgiven. The word 許し (sokushu) means “pardon” or “forgive.” 許す (souzu) means “permit,” which does make sense in this context. It’s likely that 許す is an alternative spelling used in English.

So what did this mean? Did Dr. Jones believe the “Paparazzi” were involved in something nefarious with the new “game” he was playing? Is this the reason why Dr. Jones was so afraid? Would these “Paparazzi” somehow want to “game” this person, to see if they would commit evil deeds and thereby earn a place in the game? Or was Dr. Jones just having nightmares, and was he saying that if we didn’t get out of the game, he’d forgive us? Or what did it all mean? Could this be what Dr. Jones saw in the visions he saw, with the UFOs that looked just like these spaceship that have appeared in so many UFO documentaries? Could it have had anything to do with the appearance of a UFO? If so, was it just some “dumb object” that Dr. Jones saw that he didn’t really know what it was? Could he have just seen an object and misunderstood it? Is that possible? Dr. Jones said the object was hovering, and 宗霊 was mentioned in regards to him having visions, so it was likely not “just an object.” But Dr. Jones seemed to have had such vivid visions. So did Dr. Jones see something that was really there?

Dr. Jones’ fears about the Paparazzi, the spaceships, UFOs, the Witchcraft stuff, and even the new “game” he was playing, are likely all tied together. And for those who might feel this is just the ramblings of a troubled person, Dr. Jones was clearly disturbed when he voiced his feelings. It seems that, as with many UFO-related issues, perhaps the truth about the situation is just out there, but we don’t know how to find it.

One thing we do know is this, Dr. Jones was well-loved for the many contributions he made in society. He was an active force behind many cultural movements, including the music industry, of which there are many tributes to him at the beginning of the film, 「魔女は魔法 (Mahō wa mahō)」. As we can see, there were many different ideas and beliefs, and Dr. Jones never feared what anyone thought. And he was able to get his message across to those willing to listen and hear him, despite what anyone else might think. We saw that Dr. Jones was a great man in the first part of the program, but now that we know that he was suffering from such a serious illness, he may have felt that he was no longer useful and that there was no reason to stay here any longer. 「魔女は魔法 (Mahō wa mahō)」, meaning “Witches are Magic.” Dr. Jones was a master of this magic, so he may have felt that the time had come to pass to another universe. As we’ll see, he did exactly that…but it turns out he was back the next day, and for a reason.

It should also be pointed out that the very first program mentioned UFOs, and the very first person interviewed in this program made some extremely negative remarks about UFOs being 「嘘」(usagi, lies), which means “a lie” or “a hoax.” Dr. Jones made those remarks not long after he’d been to Europe and reported seeing UFOs for the very first time. It seems likely that Dr. Jones had some serious doubts and concerns about UFOs after meeting the people with the black cars, and being given some very bad advice by the former Japanese head of the World Space Program. It’s also likely that his concerns were magnified by being involved in a car accident,</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:31
