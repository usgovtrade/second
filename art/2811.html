HONOLULU (AP) — Police in the Philippines arrested a retired U.S. Marine and his wife after receiving an alert from Interpol, which alerted the country to the couple’s possible interest in abducting a child in connection to the disappearance of their two-month-old baby in California.

The couple, Brian and Kristina Gibbons, were arrested Friday and charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, but their baby daughter was not with them when they were detained, The (Honolulu) Star-Advertiser reported.

The couple allegedly took off on June 12 from Southern California in a white van with an emblem for the U.S. Marine Corps on the back.

The Gibbonses are thought to be part of a network of people who have offered on Craigslist or other sites to exchange children for money.

A family member of the baby’s biological parents told CBS News that they received a call Friday from an FBI agent in Hawaii, and were able to get in touch with the child.

The father reportedly told CBS News that when he was finally reunited with his daughter, “She’s in good health and everything. She says, ‘Daddy I missed you.’”

The U.S. Marine’s name and photograph were circulating among different people after Interpol had issued an alert, The Star-Advertiser said.

The family has now traveled to the Philippines to join efforts in recovering the child, along with Filipino police, said the relative.

Kristina Gibbons was reported to be suffering from depression before the disappearance of her daughter, and had traveled from Kentucky to Southern California to meet her biological parents in June. However, authorities believe that the child was forcibly taken.

The Gibbonses may face another court hearing Saturday when prosecutors will request a higher bail for the couple, said the relative.

Philippine police said Interpol had not been able to prove any wrongdoings in the Philippines.

Last month, a British judge jailed a woman after she tried to hand over her baby to a stranger on the street, saying she “had only an emotional attachment” to the child and didn’t consider them as a family.

The U.S. Department of State released a travel advisory Thursday advising Americans traveling to the Philippines to exercise “increased caution” about possible “violent and extremist groups” operating there, as well as “criminal groups and corrupt officials.”

In 2012, seven Canadian women and two men were arrested in a bungled kidnapping attempt in which the mother was left bleeding in a field while authorities were led on a chase, with police shooting out the tires of the getaway vehicle.

The relatives of the kidnapped child told authorities that they traveled from Minnesota to Kentucky last year in a bid to meet their biological daughter after the child’s birth parents were sentenced to prison. The mother and father were charged with abducting the child from her birth mother, violating a Kentucky court order and were convicted in April of the charges.

The couple is expected to be sentenced for up to 15 years in prison.

Authorities believe that the child was most likely abducted by the couple, who are in custody.

“You are being given this notice to help facilitate the recovery of your minor child,” said the FBI’s Honolulu bureau office in a message from an Interpol agent to Philippine police.

“It may be possible that the infant has been adopted and has been passed on to another party by the Gibbons. It is further believed that their next target for removal will be a child in the Philippines.

A Philippines police agency later confirmed that the two were in custody.

“It’s a very sad case because these people thought that their lives were getting better,” an Interpol spokeswoman told The Associated Press on Saturday. “But at the end of the day, they are caught.”

Interpol said Gibbons, from a military family, had served as a U.S. Marine reservist.

Interpol said the two are U.S. citizens who were in contact with people who expressed an interest in adopting the child and an agreement was made, although authorities were unable to reach an agreement on the price and the payment of the funds was not completed.

Interpol sent the message to the woman’s husband in the Philippines and that was how Philippine police found out about the case, spokeswoman Erika Rainer said.

The Philippine woman had not told her husband about the plans and his family had raised concerns when the husband showed up in the Philippines last week, Rainer said.

“They were looking for someone to adopt their child,” she said.

If convicted, the couple faces a maximum penalty of six months in prison.

“She’s in good health and everything,” the father said. “She says, ‘Daddy I missed you,’”</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:42
