Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common pediatric disorders. Although it is a benign condition in most cases, it can be associated with troublesome symptoms such as regurgitation, vomiting, weight loss, failure to thrive, and sleep disturbances. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are considered the first line treatment and have been shown to be effective in clinical trials. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has been shown to be the most effective surgical treatment for GERD, but still represents only a second-line option. Management of the infant with GERD should always involve a multidisciplinary team, including pediatrician, neonatologist, and gastroenterologist. Although GERD is not as common as before, the prevalence is still important and an accurate and thorough evaluation should be performed. Recognizing the risk factors for GERD, we can help families to prevent its effects. Early recognition and treatment by primary caregivers and pediatricians may help reduce the occurrence of long-term complications. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge about the epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation of GERD in young children.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:56
