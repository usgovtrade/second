Liquid crystal display (LCD) devices generally have an arrangement of a liquid crystal panel, which has a number of pixels that are arranged in a matrix and a panel drive circuit for driving the pixels. The panel drive circuit includes gate drivers for driving the gate lines of the liquid crystal panel and data drivers for driving the data lines of the liquid crystal panel. The liquid crystal panel further includes a gate pad for receiving the gate signals from the gate drivers and a data pad for receiving the data signals from the data drivers.
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional liquid crystal display 10 having a LCD panel 20, a data PCB 12 and a gate PCB 11. In addition, the liquid crystal display 10 includes a data tape carrier package (TCP) connector 14 for receiving an external data signal from an external host, and a gate TCP connector 15 for receiving an external gate signal from an external host. The data PCB 12 and the gate PCB 11 are electrically connected to the liquid crystal panel 20 using the data tape carrier package (TCP) connector 14 and the gate TCP connector 15.
The LCD panel 20 includes a thin film transistor substrate having gate lines on a top surface, data lines on a bottom surface, and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the gate lines and the data lines. The gate lines are driven by a gate driver 13 to output a gate signal, and the data lines are driven by a data driver 16 to output a data signal. In addition, the thin film transistor substrate further includes pixel electrodes which are connected to the thin film transistors.
FIG. 2 is a plan view of the LCD panel 20 of FIG. 1, showing an LCD module before and after it is assembled. The liquid crystal display 10, as shown in FIG. 2, has a liquid crystal panel portion 36 formed with a gate line and gate electrode on the top surface and a data line and source electrode on the bottom surface. Accordingly, the gate electrode is formed on the bottom surface of the liquid crystal panel portion 36 and the source electrode is formed on the top surface thereof. A pixel region P is defined at the intersection of the gate lines and data lines, where a thin film transistor T is formed as a switching device. A plurality of the thin film transistors T is formed at a crossing point between each gate line and data line on the liquid crystal panel portion 36. Gate pads GL are formed along the ends of the gate lines and data pads DL are formed along the ends of the data lines.
Referring to FIG. 3, a gate TCP 30 and a data TCP 32, which are attached to gate pads GLA and data pads DLA, are electrically connected to the liquid crystal panel 20. More particularly, the gate TCP 30 is electrically connected to the gate pads GL of the liquid crystal panel 20 and the data TCP 32 is electrically connected to the data pads DL. As shown in FIG. 2, after the gate TCP 30 and the data TCP 32 are connected to the liquid crystal panel 20, a liquid crystal is filled into a space between the gate TCP 30 and the data TCP 32 and then, sealed, which forms a liquid crystal panel portion 36.
The gate TCP 30 has a gate TCP lead terminal 31 connected to the gate PCB 11, a gate printed circuit board (PCB) lead terminal 34 connected to the gate PCB 11, and an LCD signal input terminal 36. The data TCP 32 has a data TCP lead terminal 33 connected to the data PCB 12, a data PCB lead terminal 35 connected to the data PCB 12, and an LCD signal input terminal 37. Furthermore, a tape carrier package (TCP) mounting pad 39 is formed on the top of the gate TCP 30 and a TCP mounting pad 38 is formed on the top of the data TCP 32. The data TCP 32 and the gate TCP 30 are coupled to a tape carrier package (TCP) interface board 50 and are coupled to each other to be connected to the liquid crystal panel 20.
FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along the line 3–3′ of FIG. 2. The liquid crystal display 10, as shown in FIG. 3, has the data TCP 32 and the gate TCP 30 coupled to the tape carrier package (TCP) interface board 50. As shown in FIG. 3, the tape carrier package (TCP) interface board 50 includes a gate TCP PCB lead terminal 51 connected to the data PCB 12, a gate TCP PCB lead terminal 52 connected to the gate PCB 11, and a TCP mounting pad 39 connected to the gate TCP lead terminal 51 and to the gate TCP mounting pad 38. The data TCP 32 is coupled to the data PCB 12 by the data TCP lead terminal 33. The gate TCP 30 and the data TCP 32 are coupled together by the TCP mounting pad 38 and the TCP mounting pad 39.
In addition, the gate TCP 30 is connected to the gate PCB 11 and the data TCP 32 is connected to the data PCB 12 by the TCP interface board 50. Therefore, a gate signal output from the gate PCB 11 is transmitted to the gate TCP 30 through the gate TCP interface lead terminal 51 and the gate TCP mounting pad 39, and is transferred to the gate pad GL of the liquid crystal panel portion 36 by the gate TCP lead terminal 31. In a similar manner, a data signal output from the data PCB 12 is transmitted to the data TCP 32 through the data TCP interface lead terminal 33 and the data TCP mounting pad 39, and is transferred to the data pads DL of the liquid crystal panel portion 36 by the data TCP lead terminal 35.
As shown in FIG. 2, a distance L1 between the gate TCP 30 and the data TCP 32 is determined by the width W of the liquid crystal panel portion 36 and the length l of the gate TCP lead terminal 31 and the length l of the data TCP lead terminal 33. As such, the length l of the gate TCP lead terminal 31 and the length l of the data TCP lead terminal 33 can affect the picture quality of the liquid crystal display 10. More specifically, a distance L2 between the gate TCP 30 and the data TCP 32 in FIG. 3 affects the cross-talk effects between the gate TCP 30 and the data TCP 32. As the distance L2 becomes smaller, the cross-talk effects increase, thereby reducing the picture quality of the liquid crystal display 10. As the distance L2 becomes larger, however, the picture quality is improved.
As the cross-talk effects increase, electrical charges and signals are transferred through the liquid crystal in the liquid crystal panel portion 36. Accordingly, the picture quality of the liquid crystal display 10 is reduced due to insufficient or excessive electric charge in the liquid crystal, and image lag may occur due to insufficient driving voltage of the liquid crystal.
FIG. 4 is a graph showing cross-talk effects and electrical characteristics of liquid crystal cells. In FIG. 4, a region “G” corresponds to the voltage of the gate driver electrode of the liquid crystal cell (also referred to as “Gr”); a region “D” corresponds to the voltage of the data driver electrode of the liquid crystal cell (also referred to as “Dd”); and a region “B” corresponds to the voltage of the driving electrode of the liquid crystal cell. The region “G” is affected by the data voltage “Dd”. In other words, in order to increase the voltage, the driving electrode of the liquid crystal cell and the region “D” should be driven in a different manner. That is, the gate voltage may be increased or the driving voltage may be lowered. As such, the region “G” should be driven by means other than increasing the gate voltage. Thus, as shown in FIG. 4, a driving voltage higher than the ideal driving voltage should be applied. However, in practice, it is difficult to increase the voltage to be applied to the region “G” since the voltage applied to the region “G” is affected by the data voltage.
In order to solve the above problems, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 6-349970 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 9-241021 propose to enlarge the liquid crystal panel portion to decrease the cross-talk effects and increase the picture quality. However, the cost for manufacturing the liquid crystal panel is increased by expanding the liquid crystal panel portion. In addition, the resolution of the liquid crystal panel cannot be improved.

FIG. 7 is a plan view of a conventional liquid crystal display using a gate TCP having a gate lead terminal at each end of a gate line. The gate TCP, as shown in FIG. 7, has a gate TCP lead terminal 51 at each end of the gate line and gate TCP mounting pads 56 at the corners of the gate</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:16
