#Censored Gaming

I just got done doing a rant on censored games on YouTube. After giving some background on what censorship is here I show how a game was messed with by the censorship companies. And how it affects a kid's mind. This one is about a kid who loved playing the game called Chaos Is My Friend.

So the game was a point-and-click adventure with the kid exploring the land of his own planet. The world was pretty realistic. I think I even recall there was a bit where they could throw rocks. Pretty good game. It had a bunch of interesting little things about it too such as: you could be invisible at night, and you could run into a magical wizard-like cat that gave you magic powers and you can use.

It had nothing bad in it. It was totally innocent in all aspects. So naturally the game got censored.

You can see the end product here. It looks pretty much like it did before censorship, but in reality it's much worse.

It's a lot of fun being able to talk to some NPC's in the game. But even that is not completely gone.

To see that in action watch this video that I recorded a few years ago:

The game got censored to such a degree that the video here will not work. I was very surprised by how censored the game was because I knew that it was totally normal and I would not expect it. But you can clearly see there that there were all sorts of things removed from the game. It's very sad.

And you know why they do this? It's all about money. They want the game to sell and money is what counts here. This is their objective for censoring games. Money is all they care about here.

And the censored version of the game does NOT have those things for kids. They are for only one reason: MONEY.

They put on a great show at the E3 video game convention that people should know about. A company that makes games that will not be censored! They're called Razer and you can read about them here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razer

I'd bet they know what censorship is all about and are probably getting payed a LOT of money to do the censoring of games. The ones they've got on their list are from the Big Four:

Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

Microsoft Corporation

Nintendo

Take Two Interactive

These censors are so good at what they do that they even have a name for it:

"The Gaming Censors"

They are censoring the games so well now that the censored games aren't even fun to play. Even the graphics are completely messed up and in a lot of cases won't even load up. It really stinks to be honest because when I was a kid it was not that bad.

It was good at trying to sell a product and that's it. Nothing more. But now it's all over the place.

Gamers these days are getting a completely different version of the game because of censorship and they will never know what the original version was like. The graphics are too messed up, there are too many missing things in the game, there are too many mistakes, and it's all totally messed up.

It's like if someone told you that the game that you played when you were a kid was censored and changed to hell for some reason. They just told you that. You'll never be able to play the original version of the game. It's not on the market anymore because people will not like it once they play it. So now you never get to experience the original version. And that's how censorship works.

I played an older game and it didn't have the graphics that the newer games do. The graphics weren't as detailed as they are now and so on. I was only 12 years old but I loved playing that game. Now it's not even on the market because they changed it too much. It was once an innocent game. It was totally acceptable for all ages but now it's all messed up.

The younger people can't find this game because it's either censored or not on the market anymore because it's too old.

It makes me sick to see that I'm going to be the only one with the ability to play that game. Everyone else will miss out on it.

This is terrible. I remember playing a great game and now it's like some messed up censored game. And it all comes down to a dollar amount, you see. Money really does rule everything.

So if you love playing good games that you can play, go to the site that I told you about:

http://www.chaosismyfriend.com

Thanks for reading. If you would like to see my other work go to:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anon_User_532

The page I'm on now is one of them. This site has a lot of great stuff you can do here. I don't think this site even censors anything. It's all in plain English and easy to understand. You should visit it.

Anon user 532

I see no problem with anonuser532 on the web. They are people too, not machines, and should be treated as such. You can see my page of anonuser532 just like I did to you, I just put it up so you can have a look at it.

I can see a lot of people around the web looking into this matter and there are a lot of people who are trying to get the web censored like crazy, and it's just simply insane. Censorship is evil and it's really hard to break. It's a losing battle against censorship but the only reason why there is no problem with censorship is because people just don't care about the problems. I think the most important aspect is that it has to do with money. People just don't understand what's going on here and why they allow things to be censored.

The only way to get people to change their minds about censorship is if everyone starts looking at it. And I don't mean just me because there's no way that people can change their opinions unless they learn about it. So if you were to get your opinions changed about censorship I suggest that you try and show people some cool things.

Anyway, I'm just writing this all off my back of something very upsetting to me. And I hope you guys like the stuff I have here and maybe you guys will want to come check it out too. I'm going to show you what censorship is and how they can make games seem completely different. There are thousands of games out there that have been censored and there's a lot of them that still exist. You just have to find them. I'll talk about them at some point.

Just go here:

http://www.anonymouslycensored.com

That is a very good site that gives you information on all the censorship that is going on in the world. You can see the list of censored games on that page. The people who wrote it are working hard to get the web fixed so people don't have to worry about censorship.

What they are doing here is quite great. I think they have a chance of winning over the web censorship problem, but people need to help get the word out about it so people will know about it.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:00
