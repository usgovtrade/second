"All that matters is that..." "That I love you." "And that I want to do this with you." "You are the most selfish, manipulative, unkind... cold, unloving, bitch..." "I've ever met." "But, I can't help it." "What about now?" "Not now!" "No, no, no." "Now that's the most unkind thing I've ever heard." "If that's how you really feel about me, then you're right." "I'm a cold, unloving, bitch." "And I should probably just go now." "So, it's still not too late for me to change your mind about the sex?" "You wouldn't think about making it up to me by buying me a..." "DVD?" "Oh!" "You're gonna need to get a bigger boat." "Nine..." "Ten!" "Okay, where do you want it?" "I would like to suggest a wedding date." "A wedding date?" "Yes, a wedding date." "You know, I've only just met her, so it seems a little..." "I just think it's a wee bit soon." "And why are you whispering?" "Because I'm here, with you." "So, a wedding date." "You have your wish." "Tomorrow." "All thanks to the Captain." "She just really likes my boat." "And that just goes to show you how much she respects you as a man, and as her future father in-law." "Is this some kind of a joke?" "What?" "I'm only 19, if you hadn't noticed." "Exactly, that's why I thought it was time to get a head start." "You know, you talk about being grown-up all the time, and now's your chance to show her how mature and responsible you are." "Okay, I think I'm going to be going." "But, thank you for everything." "Wait, wait, just a second!" "Okay, I'll just come to the wedding, and if you ask me to, maybe I will dance with you." "Well, thank you for coming, I really appreciate it." "But I really should go get the rest of my luggage." "They're gonna blame me for this one." "What's going on, what have I done?" "Can't we talk about this?" "Why don't we just think about this?" "I don't want to think about anything else." "I've never felt like this about someone before." "Look, look, come on." "You're so in love with this woman and you..." "You got a lot to learn about women." "It's not a woman!" "And this?" "This is not love!" "Okay?" "So what is it?" "Please don't ask me to explain it right now." "You're gonna hurt yourself." "It's a sex thing." "I just need some physical release." "You know, like an orgasm." "I don't know, but I'm pretty sure you're gonna feel a lot better after you've had it." "So, did you?" "So..." "So, did you?" "No." "Not yet." "What, why not?" "She's just so... in love with me, I can't..." "I can't do it to her, you know?" "There is no way that I'm gonna hurt..." "Stop!" "Just go back there and put the smile back on your face, or I'm telling her how I feel." "And I don't care what you do to me," "I'm not gonna tell her how I feel." "What is it about commitment that makes men so incredibly weak?" "Okay, look, don't be so hard on yourself." "I mean, what are you supposed to do?" "I mean, it's not like you can just waltz in there and tell her that you've been waiting for her for six months and that you love her." "It's the old "waiting for the right moment" thing, right?" "It's not the right moment, Jack." "It's never the right moment." "Look at me." "If I can't say that to a woman, who can?" "I don't think there is a right moment." "She's just..." "She's just gonna be so freaking disappointed." "If she was really in love with me, she wouldn't be surprised." "Yeah, but she's not really in love with you, you know?" "I mean, what is she supposed to do?" "Say, "You know what, honey," ""you really should have gone through with that sex act."" ""You know what, honey, I love you." ""But I cannot take your virginity." ""I can't put a price on that."" "That's kind of funny coming from you." "You know, I mean, you're... a virgin too." "Yeah, I didn't know that." "Yeah." "I don't think I'm ready for sex." "I'm scared of... what it'll mean about who I am." "Maybe it's time for us to let each other go." "No, that's crazy, why would we do that?" "I think we should wait till we're both ready for it." "I think we should give it some time." "We've had a really good time together." "I love you, Jack." "And I love you." "Where did this come from?" "I'm in love with you." "You said you loved me too." "But, I mean..." "I thought you would never want to get into..." "Into what?" "A relationship?" "What the hell is wrong with you?" "Nothing!" "I don't know, I thought..." "I don't know what I thought." "And now?" "Now?" "Now I think you're the one." "Me?" "That's great!" "How does that work, out of the blue?" "Why don't you just say what you mean?" "What I mean is that it just seemed like the right time to say something." "I can't believe you." "God, are you kidding?" "It's exactly what I've been thinking for days." "But I guess I wasn't sure if you felt the same way." "I..." "I..." "I have to go." "I have to pack my stuff." "You just can't take it back!" "It doesn't work like that." "I think that you're great and..." "I like you a lot." "And you're very sexy, but..." "You're not for me." "We are so finished." "Let's go!" "Please, don't say anything." "Why did she leave?" "Don't worry, she'll be back." "Maybe it's best if you got rid of her." "I can't do that." "What if I want her?" "She wants you." "Maybe it's a sign." "Maybe it's time to move on." "To move on?" "Maybe he's right." "You should not have done this." "Sorry." "What happened?" "Look, don't worry about it." "I mean, maybe she was right." "You think?" "Of course I don't think you should've had sex with her!" "It was none of your business." "I was doing what I thought was right." "I'm sorry, but I'm really not happy that you decided on my advice." "Jack, do you want me to move out?" "No, not yet." "I'm not ready to be without you." "Well, maybe you're right." "Maybe it was none of my business." "I don't know what's going on." "You don't trust me, do you?" "No, I do trust you, Jack." "Well, how can you be so sure?" "Because I love you." "Oh, Jack, I love you." "Oh, it's just..." "That's so embarrassing." "It was no big deal." "It's just..." "Is that what I said to her?" "I want you to take me there again." "When we went over the waterfall." "You really looked beautiful." "What about Jack?" "What about Jack?" "Well, have you ever met him?" "Jack." "My boyfriend." "He's the..." "We've all just been friends for a long time." "I'm not even really sure if we're dating." "Or are we?" "I think we just need a night like that." "One night, that's all we need." "If we were together longer than that, we'd sort of get the idea, wouldn't we?" "What are you doing?" "I'm getting ready to take a long walk." "Jack." "It's all right." "Don't do this." "Not now." "I can't." "Not like this." "We have to, okay?" "I can't let you die, please." "Please, don't do this!" "Okay." "Okay." "Let's go." "No!" "Jack!" "Jack!" "Jack!" "Jack!" "Please." "Please help me." "Oh, Jack." "Don't do this." "I'm sorry, but you should have listened to me." "And now you'll never see her again."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:14
