Eddie Nahmias is a Lebanese American architect and designer. His father was an industrial engineer at a Chrysler dealership in Lebanon, and his mother taught school in Beirut. In 1975, his family immigrated to Miami, Florida. He received his undergraduate degree from Auburn University in 1984 and his Master of Architecture degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1991.

Work
Nahmias' work has been described as "evoking an early-twentieth century Arts and Crafts movement mixed with the style of modernist architect Richard Neutra". His work is also described as minimalist with a modern approach, and includes "distinctive furniture, home furnishings, decorative homewares and jewelry".

His current and upcoming projects include interior design, furniture design, interior lighting, lighting installation, public and private projects, residences, offices, urban infill projects and commercial spaces.
