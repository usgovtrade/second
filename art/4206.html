Eddie Nahmias is a Lebanese American architect and designer. His father was an industrial engineer at a Chrysler dealership in Lebanon, and his mother taught school in Beirut.

His work is also described as minimalist with a modern approach, and includes "distinctive furniture, home furnishings, decorative homewares and jewelry".
