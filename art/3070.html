(CNN) - While Hillary Clinton's husband is facing heat for his role in an investment company that fleeced many investors by stealing their money, it's worth remembering that Bill Clinton defended convicted stock swindler Marc Rich, in a way that is similar to how Trump has responded to questions about the former president.

Clinton defended Rich's business partner, Pincus Green (who was accused of looting the Rich investment company after Rich was imprisoned) in court papers filed on February 25, 1996. Green faced allegations that he had looted Rich's company along with his ex-partner.

CNN's Jeffrey Toobin reported at the time: "The White House was publicly backing Green's account, despite evidence and a lawsuit suggesting that he and other Rich associates stole tens of millions of dollars from their business partner."

Clinton joined a number of other prominent Democrats in siding with Green during the lawsuit, asserting the lawyer's innocence despite allegations of wrongdoing.

Trump often rails against his political opponents as crooks, and suggests they should be prosecuted, but like Clinton he seems unwilling to admit a mistake when an alleged fraud comes to light.

But Trump's unwillingness to admit mistakes doesn't hold a candle to the outright denial of Clinton's campaign. While he has admitted some mistakes, many Democrats were frustrated with Clinton for failing to apologize for her emails. Clinton has insisted that she did not break the law.

The Clinton campaign also struggled with a controversy over leaked audio of a conversation she had with a supporter. Clinton was recorded saying, "If you play the race card, you lose." She later explained that the comment was meant to mean that Democrats have a strong message and should not be afraid to use it, and said she should not have used the language.

Trump also suggested to CNN that he didn't apologize after the release of 2005 audio tapes of him talking about women in crass terms. "A lot of women were offended. My second mistake was I was attacked for seven weeks continuously on that event. It was ridiculous," Trump said.

"And it turned out to be really a rally for me because people got together and they talked about many other things, they talked about other topics and they've been terrific. Many, many women, I can tell you, left a lot of their jobs and were impacted very badly and hurt badly, as women by these terrible statements I was supposedly making, which I didn't make," Trump added.

For this reason, many argue that Trump has learned nothing from the political past. That may be true, but at least Trump's critics have had to acknowledge a gaffe or two. That cannot be said of Clinton and her campaign.

Clinton told an audience, "No one should be in jail for a political reason."

Clinton has faced questions about her ties to donors to the Clinton Foundation, which she has called a "vast right-wing conspiracy" and argued that it is one of the ways she "met the needs of ordinary Americans." She said, "I am proud of what we have done and I do not apologize for any of it."

Trump and Clinton have made comments that will haunt them over the course of the campaign, but it is Clinton who has been unwilling to back down. On some points, she has apologized. On others, like the emails, Clinton has not been willing to admit error.

Clinton's campaign refused to take the first step of admitting it made mistakes. When asked if they will do the same for Trump, a spokesman declined to comment.

While Trump's campaign has yet to fully shake off the sting of the "Access Hollywood" tapes, Clinton was able to move forward after the "47 percent" tape because she had already moved past it. She apologized for her comments and sought to move on.

She called the comments indefensible, and the apology was genuine. She acknowledged the mistake and moved on, something that has not been true for Trump. He refused to apologize and has continued to talk about the "Access Hollywood" tape despite the damage he already suffered.

Trump has said that if his opponent was a man, he'd drop out of the race. Meanwhile, Clinton has had to accept apologies for her "bad joke." Trump's campaign said his comments were indefensible. He was willing to admit a mistake when he was asked about the "Access Hollywood" tape. Trump has continued to go on the offensive against his rivals, and has refused to apologize for comments or retract his words.

He has said on his own website that people will "betray you every time."

In short, Trump has apologized only for being caught. Clinton, on the other hand, has owned up to the way she has helped big businesses instead of helping ordinary Americans, and she has made it clear that she is not afraid to play the race card. She has been hesitant, though, to apologize for how she said it and instead claimed that she was talking about the way President Obama has been treated.

Her campaign argued that there is a difference between what Clinton was trying to say and how it came across.

That's not always true, as Trump has argued that he's "more Indian" than many in the 1% and has suggested that a Trump presidency would stop terrorists from coming into the United States and kill the families of terrorists.

Clinton, too, can be difficult to pin down on the meaning of her comments. When pressed to answer a question about what she meant by her "superpredators" line, she declined to apologize but instead said, "I want to be very clear, I was talking about the impact of violent crime on poor communities, not about any one group."

In a world where Hillary Clinton's campaign says we are "stronger together," there is only one candidate running on the values of hope and change. For that reason, it would be reasonable to suggest that Clinton's values were too big to fall into the categories of either "hope" or "change."

Trump appears to be trying to do that with his campaign: to make it seem like it's big enough to contain both.
