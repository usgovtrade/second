lower energy prices, lower production costs, a weak Canadian dollar and less 
capital being tied up in unproductive assets.  These drivers coupled with 
proven assets, should enable us to leverage our resources across a wider 
base."  
        
    
      The report continued, "This transaction presents a unique opportunity to 
significantly reduce Enron's overall leverage, including a term loan to 
Moody's, reduction of debt to a manageable level, and a conversion of the 
majority of debt to preferred stock.  This transaction is also accretive to 
the value of Enron's trading business.  This combination creates significant 
upside potential to Enron's trading commodity positions, development projects 
and growing EBITDA base."
      
      Enron's current ratio is reported at approximately 1.20X which is above 
our target of 1.10X.  We are confident that our current ratio can be 
maintained given the long-term transactions we have in place to provide 
liquidity to our balance sheet. 

      The company said its liquidity position remains strong.  Enron concluded 
the review of all of its businesses and has taken additional steps to 
increase liquidity and the number of lower-cost, lower-risk investments we 
have in place.
      "We also believe that we have adequate liquidity to complete pending 
investments in this current quarter," said Lay. "We will continue our effort 
to preserve our cash flow and invest it in market opportunities that best 
position Enron for the future."

      During the past week, we have seen large cap and heavily weighted energy 
names take heavy losses on both the buy and sell side due to the pressure 
from the spread widening in the oil and gas sector.   The liquidity of our 
name reflects our improved position in the sector, having built up a greater 
buying power with suppliers as the large cap stocks have faltered.  In an 
effort to protect shareholder interests, we have seen traders selling out of 
positions, some incurring significant losses.

      Enron reports that its Blockbuster venture and LJM will be consolidated 
into their respective regions and report normal earnings.
