I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things a lot for her. 

BENJI 
Chris, 
I have a very strong sense about things, especially when I touch them. You 
know that. 

DOUG 
All right, she's coming right now. 

BENJI 
Okay. Thanks. I'm just holding her. 

BENJI 
Don't drop her. 

CHRIS 
I'm being very careful. Please don't drop her. 

DOUG 
This is what I get for drinking after nine? That's it? 

BENJI 
I know. 

CHRIS 
Look, if we can't even handle a baby, we're not qualified to be here. 

DOUG 
Oh. Oh! 

DOUG 
Look at that. 

CHRIS 
She's getting a little cranky. 

BENJI 
What's wrong with her? 

DOUG 
She's just tired. She's been out there all day, you know? 

CHRIS 
Yeah. 

DOUG 
And then you, too. 

CHRIS 
I know. I'm sorry. 

BENJI 
I'm going to try to get her to--come here. 

DOUG 
Go. 

CHRIS 
Go. 

BENJI 
Get her. 
Chris, bring her. 

CHRIS 
Don't drop her. 
(  Doug holds the baby in his arms. He starts to rock back and forth with it. ) 

DOUG 
Okay, so here we are. 

BENJI 
Here we are. 

DOUG 
Okay. So we're just gonna close our eyes here. Close our eyes and just relax, okay? 

CHRIS 
Sure. 

BENJI 
Just relax. 

CHRIS 
Mm-hm. 

DOUG 
(  Singing ) ♪ Close your eyes. Close your eyes. And think of nothing ♪ 

CHRIS 
(  Singing ) ♪ No tomorrow. Only heaven. Sweet heavens above ♪ 

DOUG 
That's right. That's right. 

CHRIS 
(  Singing ) ♪ Close your eyes. Close your eyes. And think of nothing ♪ 

DOUG 
That's right. That's right. 

CHRIS 
(  Singing ) ♪ Close your eyes. Close your eyes. And think of nothing ♪ 

DOUG 
That's right. That's right. 

BENJI 
Open your eyes. Open your eyes. 

DOUG 
(  Wakes up. ) What happened? 

CHRIS 
What's that? 

BENJI 
What happened? 

CHRIS 
Did you drink? 

DOUG 
(  Chuckles. ) I was just sitting here. 

CHRIS 
He was just sitting here and drinking. 

DOUG 
(  Chuckles. ) I was just doing that. 

BENJI 
Were you just sitting here drinking? 

CHRIS 
(  Smiling ) Oh, my God. 

DOUG 
I'm a little hungover. 

CHRIS 
He's a little hungover. 

BENJI 
A little bit? 

CHRIS 
A little bit. 
Why don't we give you an aspirin, Doug. Maybe that'll help. 

DOUG 
You could. 

BENJI 
An aspirin. 

DOUG 
Just get me a glass of water. I want to clean myself up. 

BENJI 
Yeah, get him some water. 
(  Doug goes to get a glass of water. ) 

DOUG 
I'll be back in just a second. 

BENJI 
What's your name again? 

CHRIS 
Benji. 

BENJI 
Benji. 

CHRIS 
That's right. 

BENJI 
Come over here for a second. 

CHRIS 
Sure. 

BENJI 
Can you stop shaking? 

CHRIS 
( Laughing ) No. 

BENJI 
You're shaking. 

CHRIS 
No, I'm not shaking. 

BENJI 
I know what's wrong with you. 

CHRIS 
No. What's wrong with you? 

BENJI 
Your energy. 

CHRIS 
My energy. 

BENJI 
Yeah. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
You have to stay calm and peaceful. You're not here to fight. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
You're not here to judge people. 

CHRIS 
What are you talking about? 

BENJI 
You're not here to judge people. 

CHRIS 
I know that. 

BENJI 
You are here to love people. 

CHRIS 
I know that. 

BENJI 
Do you? 

CHRIS 
I'm not sure. I'm having trouble remembering. 

BENJI 
You have to stay calm. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
You have to stay calm. 

CHRIS 
( Laughing ) I am calm. 

BENJI 
Well, then you should. 

CHRIS 
I am. 

BENJI 
Good. 

CHRIS 
So you have to stay calm, too. 

BENJI 
Good. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
That's good. 

CHRIS 
That's right. 

BENJI 
You know, there's a lot of negativity in your aura. 

CHRIS 
My what? 

BENJI 
Your aura. 

CHRIS 
My what? 

BENJI 
Your aura. 

CHRIS 
My what? 

BENJI 
Your aura. 

CHRIS 
My what? 

BENJI 
Your aura. 

CHRIS 
It's in my energy field. 

BENJI 
And it's negative. 

CHRIS 
That's the thing with me. 

BENJI 
It's negative. 

CHRIS 
That's the thing with me. 

BENJI 
That's a lot of negativity. 

CHRIS 
I know it's negative. 

BENJI 
That's why you're having problems in your life. 

CHRIS 
I know. 

BENJI 
That's why you're having problems in your life. 

CHRIS 
I know. 

BENJI 
You should put a little more positive energy out into the world. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
You should do that. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
This is important for you. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
I mean, you know what? 

CHRIS 
I understand what you're saying. 

BENJI 
Yes. 

CHRIS 
I do. 

BENJI 
Okay. 

CHRIS 
I'll try to stay calm. 

BENJI 
You have to stay calm. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
That's good. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
That's good. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
Okay. 

CHRIS 
I'll try. 

BENJI 
That's the thing, you have to try. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
That's the thing, you have to try. 

CHRIS 
Okay. 

BENJI 
Don't get angry. 

CHRIS 
Don't get angry? 

BENJI 
Don't get angry. 

CHRIS 
Don't get angry? 

BENJI 
Because when you get angry, it's really tough</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:32
