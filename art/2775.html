Each round, the captain (if in control) could save one contestant from the previous round that has not been eliminated. In the case of a tie, both people were chosen and would be nominated for eviction.
"The Game Players" (Season 7): A player who has achieved a major social media following is brought into the House as a new contestant. The audience has to vote for a character the contestant must nominate and they also have to nominate other contestants who could be voted off. If they win the Veto, they could decide who else should leave. If they lose the Veto, then they must nominate a house guest who would then be voted out. They cannot be nominated for eviction, but they could be voted off by another house guest. This game involved two rounds.
"My Sister Is Better Than Yours": A new challenge was created to involve one of the remaining nominees for eviction. The nominee had to name a new Houseguest who should be nominated for eviction instead. A second person voted out by another Houseguest would be eliminated. In the case of a tie, both nominees would be evicted.
"You Need a Boss" (Season 8): A celebrity was invited to the House to act as the boss of the house, and nominate one house guest to be automatically nominated for eviction. If the guest was saved, they would give the boss a prize to give the guest. If they were eliminated, then the housemate would win the prize.
"Frenemies" (Season 9): A celebrity would join the house as a new Housemate, and be part of a fake relationship with another Housemate who would be nominated for eviction. The housemates would vote on whether the two would make up or break up. If the two got along, the housemate who received the most votes would not be evicted, but the other housemate would be sent to the secret room and face the public vote.
"Instant Exes" (Season 10): The two nominees from the previous week would be put into a room together with three other previous housemates. Each would have to determine which one out of the four should be the fifth nominee for eviction, and would have to guess which housemate did not vote for them. In the case of a tie, both of the housemates involved would be nominated for eviction.
"No, You Go" (Season 10): The person who is evicted in the next round is given a chance to return to the game. One of the other nominees for eviction would go to sleep and wait in a room, while two house guests would enter to decide who the fourth nominee would be. In the case of a tie, both nominees are evicted.
"Get You Some" (Season 11): Two nominees were decided at the start of the episode. At a later point, one person from the nominees was evicted and sent to the Secret Room. The remaining two nominees then had a mission to win over the public by making various activities outside of the house, with the winner getting the final slot to become the replacement nominee. If the new nominee's partner won the mission, they would not be nominated for eviction.

The games were hosted by Adam Davies (2012–2014) and Rachel Rice (2015). The final five games were hosted by Alex Reid (2017–present).

The first four series were narrated by series regulars John Thomson, Abigail Morris, Samantha Robertson, Chris Boulter and Lisa Maxwell; the fifth series was narrated by regulars Chris Boulter and Lisa Maxwell.
