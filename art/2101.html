The Power of One is a 2017 book by Brené Brown, about vulnerability, courage and shame. It is the sequel to her 2015 book Daring Greatly.

Background 
Brown spent nearly a decade working with organizations including the Girl Scouts of the USA and the US military before her talks and TEDx work caught the attention of HBO and a Netflix special. The Power of Vulnerability became an overnight viral hit; it was later featured as a cover story in Time. In the US it sold more than one million copies and was on The New York Times Best Seller list for over fifty weeks.

Summary
Brown explains the concept of bravery as being, not about the thing you want to do, but what you are capable of when you feel no fear. She asserts that courage is not something people are born with, but a quality that can be learned. Brown emphasizes that courage is much like falling in love: it is not something that happens when everything is "just right." It is through taking risks, being vulnerable and getting messy that one can experience the courage to fully live life. 

The importance of vulnerability, the first step in courage, is the theme of the book. Brown asserts that when fear of being vulnerable is greater than the fear of being hurt, the result can be joy. It is only when we can look our fears in the eye and still embrace the discomfort that we will experience joy, connection, and wholeness. Brown writes: "My definition of vulnerability is being brave enough to show up and show out in the world with your whole heart, sharing yourself completely—wearing your heart on your sleeve...You have a finite capacity for being present with and to other people. You can choose to use a small part of it, or you can choose to use it all of it."

Reception
The Power of Vulnerability has been hailed as "a book everyone needs to read", "a life-changing book", and "a must-read."
