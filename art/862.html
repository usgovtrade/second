Researchers in Austria have used graphene to create a highly transparent concrete that absorbs less heat. They say that this material could prevent or reduce major fire incidents.

Currently, only about one per cent of the concrete in the world is concrete with nanosilica. Nanosilica can be integrated into concrete as an additive. This adds in a way of cement at a rate of 2 to 5 percent in concrete, thereby improving its tensile strength by about 20 per cent. The researchers believe that a more sustainable and sustainable concrete is very important and this research is important for the construction industry.

How does this work? Researchers explain, the research team found that graphene was an ideal substance for absorbing heat and energy in the environment. This is because the electrons in the material conduct heat easily. The problem with concrete, however, is that the electrons in the structure absorb heat from its surrounding. It can easily conduct heat, but this is not good for a building's sustainability or energy efficiency.

Instead of using carbon nanotubes, a material that has already been tried, the team instead combined graphene with a natural mineral that occurs in concrete in small amounts. The mineral, known as serpentine, has the right amount of porosity in which the graphene can be built and added into concrete.

Because graphene absorbs heat, it can lower the temperature of a concrete block. As a result, the research team recommends that this form of concrete can be used for energy-efficiency in buildings such as offices and schools.

How graphene was used? The research team used graphene sheets as a transparent coating for the concrete. By increasing the transparency of the concrete, it can allow more sunlight to penetrate through the concrete, which can increase the internal heat of the structure. The research team found that the graphene increases the thermal conductivity by 17 percent, which is a significant improvement.

In addition, the research team found that graphene can also be used to improve the tensile strength of the concrete by adding between 2 and 5 percent of the nanomaterials. This allows the concrete to increase its tensile strength by 20 percent. This is the main reason why this material is considered so important for engineering construction.

"We are now working on the next steps in our project. We have produced a concrete-like material based on graphene and silicon. By adding graphene to an ordinary concrete mixture, we have improved the material's tensile strength by 20 per cent", says Jürgen Hubmann.
