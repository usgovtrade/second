The song was featured in the UK Channel 4 show Richard Blackwood's Music from the Film (the episode 'Tales from the Darkside'). In "Tales from the Darkside", the song is performed by Joe Dolan. In 2007, Dolan appeared on the German programme "Let's Dance" on Pro7 and was revealed to have once been a member of the German pop band Tots and Teenagers who came 2nd in Germany's Next Top Model in 1998. In 2014, Dolan appeared in a one off episode of Channel 5â€™s The Gadget Show where he explained what a G-Spot is and demonstrated how to use it to reduce stress.

In June 2015, Dolan released his debut album The Waking Hours in Australia. The same year he appeared in the British show The Great British Bake Off on BBC Two, and he subsequently made a number of appearances on The Saturday Show, BBC Radio 2 and The Matt Edmunds Show. He was also asked to be a judge in the 2015 series of Britain's Got Talent where he and Amanda Holden were both judges. He now does The Sunday Show, as well as other TV appearances.

Dolan released his second album, Wasted Days, in October 2016. That same year he became a contestant on ITV's Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief in a two-week charity marathon for the National Autistic Society, in which Dolan teamed up with fellow comedian Paul Chowdhury to raise money for the charity.

In July 2017, he appeared in series four of Britain's Got More Talent as a guest judge and was a guest judge on both The Voice UK and the Australian version of The Voice, along with Robbie Williams. In 2018 he released his third studio album, The Worlds Biggest Brass Band, which made the top 10 in the UK Albums Chart. It was followed by a new studio album in 2019, Good Things.
