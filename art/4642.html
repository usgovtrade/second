The first two chapters are a general survey of microelectronic sensors, covering some of the more traditional sensor and biosensor designs, such as the differential capacitance accelerometer, the thermal airflow sensor, and the electrochemical glucose sensor, and comparing them with some of the new MEMS approaches such as resonant structures, microcantilevers, and SAW devices. The three subsequent chapters focus on specific MEMS sensors. Chapter 3 covers the use of biosensors for monitoring biological cell functions. MEMS sensors are increasingly being used to measure cell activities, since the cells are so tiny that even optical detection is difficult. There are a number of issues that have to be addressed, which the authors identify: - What type of sensor - Optical or acoustic or something else. - Single cell or groups - How large are you?- How many? - How many to sample, etc. - At what rate - What is rate really? - Is it linear or an average over a time? - How can you measure it without changing the conditions? - And so on. - How do we know that what the sensor says is true? Chapter 4 focuses on sensors to measure cell motion, and it is written primarily for a research community. MEMS sensor principles are discussed, and the sensors reviewed are mostly the piezoresistive and capacitive types. The biosensors that are discussed are mostly biochemical sensors. The sensors are not necessarily used to measure just one thing. The focus is on biosensors, and much of the discussion is also how biosensors work. If you can figure out how to measure the parameter, there are a number of sensor designs available to sense the parameter. Chapter 5 discusses the development of new and innovative MEMS sensors for applications in cell-based biosensing. An overview of recent developments and current trends in the biotechnology, in MEMS research, and MEMS applications are given. These are followed by an assessment of recent research efforts in the areas of MEMS microfluidics, bioMEMS, microdialysis and microhemodialysis, and microreactions. For bioseparation, this chapter focuses on bioMEMS (micro total analysis systems). The MEMS sensors that are discussed cover those for monitoring physical, chemical, electrical, and electrochemical parameters that are important for biological processes. A survey is given of the various applications for biomolecules and cells, such as DNA detection, antibody detection, protein detection, cell counting, cell isolation, detection of a specific ligand or drug, pathogen detection, cellular signaling, and microfluidics.

What is the nature of modern science? How does science relate to technology? How does technology relate to society? The answers to these questions form the heart of the book. Science & technology studies is a major field that seeks to explore the nature of modern science and technology. A particular emphasis is placed on the complex ...

The purpose of this book is to present a critical overview of the main developments of the field of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The topic is one of the most important areas of microelectronics with currently a high and rapid development pace. The book is structured in three parts: chapters 1 to 4 provide a general overview of the basic technology of MEMS, and introduce the principles of MEMS structure formation, fabrication of structures and materials, material properties and principles of operation of MEMS. Chapters 5 to 8 discuss the most important application areas, and present the latest developments in the field. This part consists of 2 monographs in the area of microelectronics and MEMS, respectively. The focus in these chapters is on specific areas of application, such as microsensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, transducers, microrelays, microvalves, micromotors, microrelays, microgyroscopes, microgenerators, ultrasonic microsensors and transducers, microactuators and MEMS for microfluidic devices. This part of the book is in line with the recent trends in MEMS research.

MEMS, often referred to as micromachines, microelectromechanical systems, micromachines or micromanufacturing, describes machines whose critical dimensions are between 10 -200m. For this reason, the book covers topics ranging from microsensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometer sensors, microgyroscopes and microgenerators, gyroscopes and microgenerators, micromotors, microfluidics, microelectronics, and microbiosensors. It serves as a reference book for engineers and scientists working in the above areas. It includes a review of major patents and publications in the field. The book is divided into four parts. Part I provides the detailed methods required to understand the operation of the basic principles of operation of MEMS. Part II describes the operation and construction of microgyroscopes and its application in biomedical field. Part III is dedicated to miniature mechanical devices and their applications, while Part IV covers microfluidics and microelectronics. Part I: MEMS Basics - The first chapter introduces the key elements for MEMS and the application of MEMS in many fields. It examines the fundamentals of MEMS technology, and introduces MEMS concepts, materials and operation principles, device structures, basic device characteristics, the operation principles of micromotors and microsensors and biosensors. Part II: MEMS Devices - Chapter 7 focuses on microgyroscopes. The microgyroscope is based on the Coriolis force, which is the basis of microgyroscopes. Chapter 8 describes the microgyroscope principle, and also introduces the MEMS accelerometer and its operating principle. Part III: Driven Systems - Chapter 9 provides a review of gyroscopes, describing their performance and applications in various fields. Chapter 10 is dedicated to biomembrane gyroscopes.
