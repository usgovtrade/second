We don’t even call it lingerie any more. It’s just fashion. People want something feminine. The style is youthful, but the silhouette is not,” she explains. The most popular lingerie designs include the push-up bra, the thong, the one-shoulder strapless dress and the sheer top, according to our research. And, as we find when asking about how people think about lingerie, people have different definitions of what it means to be sexy, depending on your age. Interestingly, our survey found that younger women think lingerie is more about sex appeal and younger men think it’s more about femininity. But, for older women and men, it’s about beauty and sexual attraction.

Tips from the Lingerie Girls on Tips on How to Wear It:

Kylie Bisutti. “Don’t try to cover your shoulders in lingerie,” she says. “The more simple the silhouette, the better the lingerie is.” “The bras at the Victoria’s Secret stores are amazing, like the ones with lots of criss-cross detail.” “They always have to make everything in America pretty,” says Sara Zakarin. “But that’s not what I go for in Europe.” “In Victoria’s Secret bras, the band in the back is always missing, like the part that holds it in place, and it always rides up. It has to do with its original purpose. I do like the fact that the VS bras and bras from the ’80s are similar to those from the ’40s and ’50s. They are quite comfortable.”

Sara Zakarin. “We look at the Victoria’s Secret bralettes and they look really beautiful, but they are always quite large,“ she says. “For us, the lingerie is mostly for special occasions. We would never wear it as part of our everyday wardrobe.” “I had just gotten my driver’s license and bought the first thong that I saw on the wall at Victoria’s Secret. That was the year that Victoria’s Secret came out with their thong, so I got the first one. It was a little bit too small, so I still had to put my own lace around it.”

Anna Kova. “They have this one that is perfect and that’s their basic, which you can wear to go dancing with a mini dress. It has a beautiful lacy and a small black bow. It’s so cute!” “I was born in the ’80s, so I do like to wear lingerie, but there are rules: It has to be sexy or funny! The classic bra I wear when I have an important meeting. It makes a difference if you have it on or not.”

Ana Montesinos Angulo. “I am not very happy with what they are selling in the European stores right now. They do a lot of push-up bras, which are not easy to wear for my body type, and they have these very high bras that they call ‘Brazilian bras’. They are quite uncomfortable, and the Brazilian part is because we can’t pronounce ‘Brasil’ in Spanish.” “If you want a good lingerie collection, go to Japan.”

Liza Kirily-Hastings. “The Victoria’s Secret bras are very cheap, and that’s one of the main reasons I stopped wearing them,” she says. “I love vintage, and I want my bras to last.”

Mira Petrova. “I love that they bring new lingerie out every season. Their lingerie is beautiful,” she says. “They definitely have some of the best bras around. They have some really good ones for all shapes and sizes.”

Andreea Balan. “I love to buy the sexy ones that they bring to New York fashion shows for their VIP customers,” she says. “The brand makes a statement and there’s something unique about their products.”

Amina Koparan. “There is not a store in London that’s giving you great quality at a great price. They have some pretty designs, but they are expensive, and they don’t last. And it’s always the same bras in every color.” “People can show off a lot more through their underthings than they can through clothes. It’s more of a fetish thing. A good piece of lingerie doesn’t make you ugly, but it makes you feel better.”

Shawnee Talbot. “I do buy a lot of my lingerie at Victoria’s Secret because it’s cheap and trendy, but it’s also in my size,” she says. “It’s not the best quality, but it’s the easiest to wear and you don’t have to get them tailored. It’s a bit better than wearing a big sack. They have some cute ones for work, but not in every color, so I only wear them when I have to.”

Nadine Monge. “I bought a few pieces of lingerie from Victoria’s Secret a few years ago, and I wear it with a dress I really like from another shop,” she says. “The Victoria’s Secret is one of the trendier brands that I wear, but it’s not my favorite.”

Jasmina Graca. “I don’t find Victoria’s Secret very sexy. It’s always more for a girly girl than a sexy girl. They put too much in it,” she says. “My style is more androgynous. I have a few friends that are like me and we have a lot of fun with fashion. We look for vintage and go to markets. I don’t like this new kind of sexy, very high heels and too much lace and stuff. We like the funky look.”

Katarina Tveit. “Victoria’s Secret does nothing for me. The bras are not really made for my breasts,” she says. “They make it look like you have huge breasts, when you don’t.”

Mariah Coe. “Victoria’s Secret has great style and they definitely offer a variety of bras and panties. The push-up bras are gorgeous and come in every shape and size, and Victoria’s Secret has a large selection of the hottest lingerie to pick from. They definitely deliver on the sexy style that they market,” she says.

Ana Silvestre. “At one point, I was buying everything they had because they had so many different styles,” she says. “They have now started to put way too much junk on the racks, with lots of unnecessary decorations.” “I don’t really wear underwear. I wear the bras from Victoria’s Secret, but I wear it with jeans.

Eliane Cintra. “I really like Victoria’s Secret underwear, but I don’t find Victoria’s Secret too sexy,” she says. “You have to choose a style, and then buy the size that is appropriate. Some people buy too big and others buy too small. I used to buy all the bras and they always fitted me perfectly.”

Isabel Andrade. “When I was young, I used to buy everything from Victoria’s Secret. Now, I only wear the bras when I have to. You have to keep them in good condition so that you can wear them a few years. But their stuff can be a little pricey,” she says. “The bras are really beautiful and they’re very comfortable.”

“Lingerie is a very powerful thing,” Anita Dongre said, “The look a person gives you is very powerful, and in that regard, it can make or break a fashion show. It has to be sexy, but in a way that can be worn on the street, in a boardroom or in a nightclub.” It’s not about finding a place in an industry’s hierarchy</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:51
