Joe's Iced Coffee is so excellent, it has been featured on Chicago Foodie and Chicagoist. One person wrote: “After a winter slog through iced slush on the sidewalks of downtown Chicago, a walk into Joe's Bar & Grill can mean a pick-me-up from a classic iced coffee.” And I love it!

It doesn't have a strong vanilla flavor, but if you like iced coffee you'll love this. It is so thick, smooth and creamy, it's almost too good to be true. The perfect thing to drink while walking the neighborhood.

Iced coffees are available at Joe's and Rookery at $3.99 for large ($3.79 for medium, and $3.99 for a small) with the big cup for $6.99.

Joe's iced coffee is one of the best I've ever had. And considering I try new iced coffee all the time, I really have to give Joe's a thumbs up.

Joe's is located at:

2121 N. Halsted St,

Chicago, IL 60657

5. Rookery

The Rookery's iced coffee is also fantastic, and their large is $5.09, making this coffee about as cheap as you can get around town. I can't say it's the best iced coffee I've tried, but it's definitely a solid contender.

When it comes to iced coffee, the Rookery has to make my list of top five. Rookery iced coffee is a classic. The taste is wonderful and the ice is made with real ice cubes so it makes you wonder why anyone would pay more than a buck or two for fancy iced coffee.

If I'm feeling like having an iced coffee, I definitely reach for Rookery.

Rookery's iced coffee is not a fancy coffee shop but with such a high bar for iced coffee, I still find this place very enjoyable and satisfying.

Rookery is located at:

1658 N. Milwaukee Ave,

Chicago, IL 60647

6. Chicago Coffee

The Chicago Coffee iced coffee is probably not what you're looking for if you're out shopping, but if you want a iced coffee for a snack then look no further.

This iced coffee is $1.99 and has about 8 ounces of coffee in it. Unlike other iced coffee locations, there is no coffee shop or menu here.

However, as with all the other iced coffees I mentioned, this is a fantastic iced coffee. Chicago Coffee has a great coffee to iced coffee ratio. You get a good amount of coffee in the cup but not too much that you have to over sip it or drink way too quickly.

It has that nice smooth coffee flavor that I think is one of the best iced coffees you can get around town.

Take note: There's a $2 iced coffee promotion and there's often a $2 off small iced coffee for seniors promotion going on. All these promotions are a wonderful perk of having a great iced coffee like this one.

7. Skyline Coffee

Skyline Coffee iced coffee is one of the best I've ever had. It has a very good coffee to iced coffee ratio and it is also very smooth with a lot of flavor.

Skyline's iced coffee is very strong, about 8 ounces in a small cup (which is what I get) and they let you choose from 2 ounces, 3 ounces, or 4 ounces. I usually get three ounces because that gives me the perfect amount of coffee without making it too strong or not strong enough.

I actually prefer Skyline's iced coffee to Rookery's. Skyline's iced coffee is so rich and smooth that I enjoy this more than Rookery's.

There's also some pretty intense art work behind the counter and it has the kind of friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a Starbucks. It even has a little coffee bar that's perfect for people who enjoy drinking coffee, but like to hold a cup instead of using a styrofoam to-go cup.

Skyline's iced coffee is one of my all time favorites and it should be a part of everyone's day in Chicago.

Skyline Coffee iced coffee is located at:

2035 W. Granville Ave, Chicago, IL 60608

8. Soho Coffee Company

If you're into drinking coffee and you're not happy with Skyline's iced coffee, Soho Coffee is an excellent place to get an iced coffee. I am an iced coffee snob, so I do like Soho's iced coffee better than Skyline's.

Soho's iced coffee is still pretty good. It's a nice smooth cup with more flavor than your average iced coffee. You can find Soho's iced coffee in the city and other locations around the suburbs.

I try to go back to Soho's when I see it. This is a great iced coffee that I know I can count on, it will satisfy my iced coffee cravings without emptying my bank account or forcing me to consume way too much coffee.

It's a coffee so good, I don't mind buying more and bringing it in a Thermos.

Iced coffees are available at Soho's and Soho Coffee Express (there are three locations, just Google Soho Coffee Express Chicago and see which one is closest to you.) for $4.95 for a large, $2.95 for a small and $5.00 for an extra large.

Soho's iced coffee is one of the best I've ever had. Their extra large iced coffee is my favorite.

Soho is located at:

3300 N. Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL 60613

9. Intelligentsia Coffee

You won't find Soho's iced coffee, but Intelligentsia's iced coffee is much better than Skyline's and they are usually a lot cheaper than Soho's.

Intelligentsia coffee is one of my favorite coffee shops. The iced coffee is delicious. But I've never gotten an iced coffee in their so it's hard to say which iced coffee is the best.

My guess is Intelligentsia's iced coffee is on the high side of average. It's still a really good iced coffee, but I definitely prefer Soho's.

Intelligentsia Coffee iced coffee is available for purchase at their coffee shop and online.

Intelligentsia Coffee is located at:

1623 N. Milwaukee Ave, Chicago, IL 60622

10. Gino's Coffee

Gino's Coffee has a very nice iced coffee with a nice, smooth coffee flavor. I don't usually drink iced coffee, but when I do, Gino's iced coffee is a coffee shop I reach for.

Gino's iced coffee is definitely not my favorite, but it's a nice coffee shop to have around, and the iced coffee is cheap and not too strong. If you enjoy a iced coffee but don't want a lot of coffee, Gino's iced coffee is a great option to have around town.

There's some nice flavor here, and the fact that it's $2 makes it a cheap option to have around town.

Gino's is located at:
