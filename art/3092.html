The Tides Are Turning is the tenth studio album by the Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in October 1993 on Reprise Records. The album reached number one on the UK album charts. It also reached number 26 on the US Billboard 200 chart.

Content
Like much of his more recent work, The Tides Are Turning is composed of spiritual numbers like "Mystic Eyes" and "Beautiful Vision," alongside more familiar uptempo numbers like "The Way Young Lovers Do," which also appeared on the  B-side of his 1993 single "King of the Road." Several tracks are written from the perspective of an elderly person—or simply about someone who's older. The album's closer is a cover of the country-rock ballad "The Tides Are Turning," which had been originally performed by The Everly Brothers on their 1960 album, Songs Our Daddy Taught Us.

Critical reception

In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called The Tides Are Turning Morrison's "best record since 1990s Days Like This." In his review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called the album "magnificent," and commented that "it's hard to imagine anyone but Van Morrison rewriting this standard." Robert Christgau was less impressed in his column for The Village Voice and gave it an "honorable mention" though.
