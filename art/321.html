of 
seeing two black lines, I actually see
this. 
In this picture, we only have
one black line. So, when I took 
that picture of that plate I 
knew I had to get back to
camp. 
If I didn't 
understand this, I had to try again. 
If I had to do a second
try, I wanted to take that time 
to make sure I knew what I 
was doing. 
My mother was very excited when she 
saw how much 
I was learning and how fast I was 
going. I don't think she ever
said anything like "slow down" 
or "you're never going to use 
this in a million years." So, 
she was just excited and 
very excited that she was able to 
watch me on video every 
time I was trying to solve 
these problems. 
I knew I could do it. I could 
understand 
these concepts. 
And after a couple of weeks, 
they 
asked me to show them something 
that I had 
worked out and was 
excited about. 
That's how I knew I was doing
something that they were not. 
And so, that's a big 
moment for me. 
It was a big moment. 
That was something that I 
didn't think I could do at first 
but 
after a while, I really started 
to get into it 
and I really liked it. 
And then I started looking up 
topics online to try 
to see if there was any other 
things I could do with that. 
To see if there was any other 
things I could do. 
So, I went on this site, the 
Math Olympiad
International Team, and I started 
seeing videos from these 
other teams. These 
other great people trying to 
figure out 
who else would be good 
at math. And I started seeing 
other people. 
As I was 
continuing to learn and
understand more, I was 
getting into more complex stuff, 
more advanced 
stuff, and all of a sudden 
these other 
teams started winning medals. 
People who had never really 
competed in math 
or even learned the subject and
they started 
winning medals and doing well. 
That's what 
led me to apply to 
Olympiad Team USA. 
I didn't 
necessarily want to go to the 
Olympic 
games, I wanted to do it to 
compete with the top 
teams in the 
world, but at the same 
time to be 
better than 
those teams. So, I 
decided to put in an 
application to be on the team. 
And I saw that not 
only was the math team a part 
of it 
but that they also had a 
technology team and I knew I 
loved science so 
I also thought, 
"That's probably a good 
opportunity for me as well." I 
didn't 
know if I could be good at it. 
I knew I wasn't at 
the top level of skill, but I 
knew that if I had more 
time, I'd eventually learn 
what I 
needed to know. So, I applied 
and I had such a great experience 
that 
I also wanted to be part of 
that team. I just didn't know 
what 
my exact career would be. 
I 
didn't know if I would end up 
working 
on a team, or if I would keep 
doing math. 
I just 
didn't know what 
would come after 
high school. I knew I wanted to 
get 
a job that was 
math-based, I knew I wanted to 
do something related to math and 
tech 
and things that 
my brain was 
most comfortable doing, 
but I had no idea 
what that was. 
So, I just put in the 
application to 
the technology team. 
I didn't 
know what was 
going to happen with 
the other side of my 
application for the math team. 
When I 
got accepted to 
Olympiad Team USA, I was so 
excited. 
I thought, "Oh my gosh, this is 
going to be so great. 
I'm 
so excited to see what's in
store for me 
when I get there and the 
things that I can do." 
That was 
a big time for 
me because I wasn't 
always excited about 
math. 
I didn't 
have a particular
passion for it. 
When I 
started applying, I was 
excited and 
thrilled. But I 
was nervous because 
it's not a 
classroom-type environment. 
There are going to be people who 
are much smarter than me 
that I'll have to compete with. 
And 
I think I was scared that I 
wouldn't know 
enough to know I had 
what it took to be
competitive with them. 
And I knew I had to show that
that I did know what it took to 
be competitive with them. 
In order to 
be successful in math and 
science, you have to 
know how to learn and retain 
the 
information that you have 
been given. 
And if you don't know how to 
learn, then you're not going to 
learn the 
information you need. 
It was like I was 
going to go to this new country 
that I knew 
very little about. 
And I was going to have to 
start over from 
the beginning and try to 
figure out who I was 
and what I was going to do. 
I was really excited about 
that. 
So, it 
was very exciting. 
I had a 
huge sense of 
hype because 
I didn't know exactly what I 
was going to 
be doing and I 
was excited. 
At first, I didn't really 
know much about any of the 
other members 
of my team. 
Most of them were very 
interesting to me and I 
talked to them and they 
were interesting, but I didn't 
have much in common with them. 
And even when they were 
talking to me, I felt 
like 
they were talking 
to a different person from 
myself. 
I didn't 
know it was me talking 
to a different person. 
And that was a weird 
feeling to be like 
"I don't know who you are, 
but I know we're 
communicating right now, 
so I know you." 
I didn't know any of them 
personally, and some of them I 
hadn't 
known until we started 
working 
together and 
became closer. 
Because of the way I was put
together, I had 
trouble 
making friends with other 
people because I would always be 
trying 
to make friends with 
everyone. I really was 
just trying to get to 
know people and be 
friends with them. 
And because we were so 
diverse, it was 
hard. 
It was
hard to 
find people who we 
weren't very similar to and we 
would be compatible with. 
In the end, it wasn't necessarily
difficult because 
we were so different. 
I don't know why I put 
up with that so long because 
nobody 
should ever have to try to be 
friends with a white guy. 
That's 
just weird to me. 
But that was the problem. 
Not 
having anything in common with 
any of the 
other members of my 
team, I ended up 
focusing on my 
relationships with 
the 
Olympiad Team USA 
staff. 
Because I was having to create 
so many 
friends with these other 
students, it was hard 
to find people who I 
didn't know that well, 
who I didn't know very well, 
who 
I knew 
really well. 
I think 
it was so 
easy for me 
to get 
friendships 
with the staff 
and 
volunteers 
because we spent so</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:25
