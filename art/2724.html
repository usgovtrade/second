We can only imagine that when a young boy in Bihar, India hears his parents say, "We're sending you to school so you can have an education, so that you'll have a chance at a better life," he'll understand that those are words that will keep him alive. But when they take him out and literally stuff him inside the local coal mine, their hopes for him are quickly dashed. Now, his parents will soon be digging him out of the mine, and in this video, "My Mom Is Going to Kill Me!," the boy explains the events leading up to his death.

He says that the children who were in his "classroom" worked eight hours a day, then walked home for dinner. When they got home they were hit with a stick on the buttocks to keep them awake all night. He explains that sometimes the parents go with the children to the coal mines and sometimes they don't. His mother went to the mine and came back saying they would be allowed to come home on Sundays, because she had found a coal patch. They went back, and the children were never seen again, but some time later there were the sounds of shovels.

When he was discovered, he was in a box with the same height as him and was barely breathing. They were able to recover him, but he lost all of his fingers. He says that the workers in the mine did this to make it harder for him to run away from the shovels. His mother took him home and later died of a heart attack, leaving him to his father, who is also blind. It's sad that there's no longer anyone who could help him, but what's even sadder is that there are still those who are using children in the coal mines.

If you want to help stop this, you can do two things: Learn more about the issue, and donate to an organization like International Human Rights or Amnesty International. You can click this link to find the websites of some charities that will use your donation to help children in India. While I wish there was more that could be done for this young man, we do have a lot that can be done. And while the best way to prevent this from happening to other kids around the world is for kids in other countries to get out of the coal mines, since they are so common in developing countries, your awareness and support can help save these kids from death and torture.

I encourage you to donate money to a charity that will help children like this guy in India, and to stay tuned for another video from Amnesty International in January 2011. It should show you another horrific thing that human beings can do to one another. Thanks for reading.
