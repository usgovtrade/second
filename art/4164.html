What does “sickened me” mean?

I’m sickened by how those who would’ve otherwise been protesting the war and are out and about right now buying themselves stuff, rather than saving their coins, are giving the war it’s justifications with the blood of their brothers.
The article reads:

“I’ve read two books on Iraq and I was really sickened by how those who would’ve otherwise been protesting the war and are out and about right now buying themselves stuff, rather than saving their coins, are giving the war it’s justifications with the blood of their brothers,” said one.

What’s the meaning of “sickened me”? Why is the writer saying “I was really sickened by”? Why isn’t she saying “I’m sickened by”?

A:

"Sickened me" is an idiomatic expression. It means to upset or disgust someone. "I'm sickened by ..." means "I am sickened by ... "

...sickened by seeing a murder - What is the best way to describe "sickened by seeing a murder"?
...sickened by the stench - What is the best way to describe "sickened by the stench"?
...sickened by seeing a murder - What is the best way to describe "sickened by seeing a murder"?
...sickened by the stench - What is the best way to describe "sickened by the stench"?

To be really sickened by something is idiomatic, the writer should have used the expression. "Really sickened me" is the closest I can get. So the sentence means:

I was really sickened by reading the two books.

The meaning of "give the war its justifications" is ambiguous. To give the war its justifications can either mean

They give the war justification, i.e., make the war seem to be justified.
They give the justification for the war, i.e., present all the reasons for the war.

That it is the second meaning is clear from the context. The writer is sickened by the fact that people are now buying presents, rather than saving their money for the cause. In other words, the reasons for the war are either not known or not discussed, or, they are just excuses to go to war. 
So, this should be the sentence to be used:

I was really sickened by the fact that they are giving the war its justifications with the blood of their brothers, whom they killed for no rhyme or reason.

A:

Sickened is an idiom which means something like nauseated, horrified. It can mean "I am nauseated by", but it also means "I am disgusted by". 

sickened by, ADJ. 1. 
  1. 1. Nauseated or disgusted by something or some occurrence: I feel sickened by the corruption.
  2. 2. Very upset by something: sickened by the loss of her life; sickened by the death of the dog. (from TFD)

If I felt sickened by something, it would be something that nauseated or disgusted me. If I felt really sickened by something, that something would cause me the greatest possible nausea.

A:

I can't explain the context in which that sentence is being used.  
You could use it to mean that the writing upset you.
As an example, when you read about a sickening crime, it bothers you.

She was appalled by the level of cruelty in the man's character.
He sickened her.
He was so angry that he was sickening to watch.

Also, if you have a friend who has been sick for a while, that may bother you because you want to see them get better.

I am sickened by what is happening to my country.

That being said, you could use it to mean that you got some really bad news and felt sick about it.  Like a report about something really sad or something very disturbing.

"What should I do now?"  "I'm sickened by the news I heard just now."

It means you are not in control of your emotions at that moment.

"That is so awful. I really wish I didn't know that."
  "That is so awful. I really wish I didn't know that."

It's a way to say that you wish you had a different reaction than what you were feeling at that moment.

I wish I hadn't felt sickened by what he said.
