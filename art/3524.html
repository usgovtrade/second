According to the source, the casting agents had met with the model in Los Angeles and London, telling her that she had been chosen for the show. It’s thought that she was asked to do a number of tests, though none have been confirmed, with the filming supposedly being done in LA in September and moving on to London for more filming and then a series of filming dates were arranged, and she was told she had the option of doing a second series, as well as a documentary following her with the show.

It’s said that this is the ‘big break’ for the model that she’s been working for, with the source adding, “This could be exactly what she needs to get noticed as she hasn’t had the happiest of starts in her career. There’s a lot more work in the pipeline for her. It’s not all that she does though.”

“Reality shows are great for getting yourself into the public eye and getting a lot of attention, but it’s definitely not something that I would like to do.”

“Of course, I could have a lot of fun and my ego would be fine with it if they got my own show or chose me to be on another show. In my experience, I think reality TV is a good way to do something in the entertainment industry, but I’ve never been really keen on it.”

“But if I did something like this I would choose the right people and would work with people that have a good reputation – which would be important because they might be my agent, my publicist, or people who I would be working with in the business. “

Speaking of her publicist, it’s said that the model’s publicist is trying to arrange for her to do an audition in front of Bauer Media and her managers.

We do hope that this is indeed a case of someone being made an offer they couldn’t refuse, and that it won’t be fake. While the thought of the model going in front of a camera and doing a lie detector test sounds ridiculous, that doesn’t mean that it wouldn’t be interesting to watch. But will they be able to show what’s really going on behind the scenes or will it just be a case of showing viewers what they think they’ll want to see?

At the end of the day, it’s still an acting gig and we’re sure the model could be an amazing actress, but whether she wants to do it or not will remain to be seen. It will definitely be interesting to see what comes of this, and we can’t wait to find out what she’s going to do!

It’s a busy day for her as the model has just signed to Women Management in Canada for Canada Vogue. But perhaps one of the reasons for her signing on to Women Management is to give her a bit more work, particularly in Canada.

A statement from her management said that “this signing gives Lydia the global platform to showcase her incredible modelling career, which has come to a well-deserved crescendo. We look forward to an exciting new chapter for Lydia as she expands her profile internationally, following an already highly successful career in the UK.”

“She’s got great experience in editorial but her main strength is probably that she is very beautiful – that’s what they look for as a global fashion brand. They’re hoping that having her in the fold of their brand will open more doors internationally for us, and as the brand grows, so does she. We are very much looking forward to seeing her take off in this next phase of her career.”

The source also said that they’re hoping to secure her enough work in Canada to keep her busy, and that this signing gives her the chance to do more modelling work in the country and really make a name for herself in the country.

It’s been reported that the model will most likely be one of the faces in their swimwear campaign, with the source adding that she will be doing some catwalk shows in Canada. They did add that Canada Vogue doesn’t have any models working with them right now, but it’s said that Canada Vogue are looking to have an exciting campaign coming up.

In regards to the model’s love of acting, it’s said that Canada Vogue are open to working with her. It’s been reported that her publicists have already booked the model for a TV commercial and that she could be used for Canada Vogue’s future campaigns. So this isn’t just about her getting the job and then quitting – she’s been looking to get more work in the country.

It’s now been reported that after doing the job she did, Lydia has now been made the face of Canada Vogue – and by getting the job, she was supposed to have been given the chance to represent Canada Vogue overseas.

According to her agent, the fact that Canada Vogue are looking for a new face of their brand suggests that the model will be staying in Canada with the company. It’s been added that their previous face, Charlotte Taylor, left the company after four years working with the brand.

Speaking of this, the model’s agent added that “She is an amazing model who embodies all the qualities that a brand would look for in a model. She’s a versatile, classy, fun and professional model who works a lot in Europe but she wants to be an ambassador for Canadian brands and have herself a presence in Canada as well.

She is very open and available and willing to work with anyone – and they are looking for someone who wants to work with the company.”

It’s been added that Lydia’s new job will be a mix of both editorial and commercial, and that she will start booking her first modelling jobs straight away.

It’s reported that it’s all very exciting for the model, and that she wants to work hard to make it to the top in Canada. She’s said to be a great friend and an awesome model, and it sounds like she will be having a lot of fun with the job and the company. They’ve also said that she hopes to build a following in Canada so that one day she might move there.

It’s been reported that Lydia is also getting set to shoot with fashion photographer Steven Moleski for a catalogue shoot. They added that this may lead to more magazine jobs, which would be great for the model.

It’s been added that the source did say the model can work as an actor, but that’s probably only because she’s already been doing photo shoots and such like. They also added that this will likely mean a lack of work, which isn’t something the model is looking for.

It’s just the latest addition to an amazing week for Lydia – but is she ready to move to Canada and continue her modelling career? Does she have what it takes to pull it off? Let us know what you think.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:26
