Unable to upload images in the JotForm for WordPress system

Hello. I am using Jotform to set up my blog and wordpress system for Jotform. Every time I tried to use the built in image editor or even paste in an image url, I get the same error every time: "Something went wrong when updating your image." Help!

Here is the message I get when I click update. I tried uploading it through my wordpress media folder, it gives me a file permission error. I tried different extensions to see if that would make a difference but it is not. Any ideas?

Hi nikki. I see you have the issue with adding the image into Jotform. I'm not sure what the issue is but can you try to save your form, and then reopen it and use the option to use the uploaded image by clicking the images tab when you edit your form. If you still have problems, please email me with a link to the form so I can see what's happening.

Thanks Janne. I still have the issue. I have tried all of the suggestions you've shared in your article and on the JotForm support forums, but the images never show up on the form, just a blank space. Please advise on what I need to do in order to solve this issue and to post the photos on my blog page. Thanks!

Hi Nigel,

If you still have this issue then I would send us your form so I can investigate further. Thanks

I just wanted to let you know that I have finally got the images uploaded and am having to do some additional work to change the size from 2000x2000 to 150x150 but I have finally got it. I still can't figure out why I couldn't upload my own images. I will be sending you an email with the form and a screenshot. I have gone through the entire tutorial again, and it looks great! Thank you so much!

I found this today (in the bottom of my posts after I edited one of them) and thought I would let you know:

Thanks for all your help Nigel. I ended up redownloading the entire form in photoshop and changing the form so that it would upload correctly from my computer. I also had to upload the images again, and had to cut and paste the captions from my Word document, but the thing is now that it is uploaded, I can't use some of the fields that I was using on other pages. For instance, I had a radio button set up with options like Yes, No, Other, etc. on my page; the form for this page has a radio button to signify that you will agree to all the terms and conditions (which I had to put in for a different field but that's a whole nother issue). Anyway, I can't use this now because it only has radio buttons that say Yes, No, and Other. Does this mean I have to reupload all the forms in order for them to have all the options I want? It seems like an easy way to not get my files uploaded and then my form won't load at all. Sorry for being so unskilled at this...I guess I thought it would be more like Word, where you just cut and paste, but I guess I have to do all this work by hand, and it is not as simple as I had thought.

Hi, Nigel, I think you'll find that it works exactly the same way as in a Word document. The fact that you've posted your form in JotForm means you've set it up in the right way and all your fields are set up correctly for JotForm, so it should be working fine. However, if you don't want to re-upload your form then you could open up the form in Notepad and change the text within the fields and re-save. This should then create a brand new form and allow you to keep using it.

This will probably get all deleted but thank you so much for your help Nigel! I haven't been able to get all the fields on my page to work so I will have to re-do the form and upload a new one...it's no big deal because I have never gotten them to work in the first place. When I open the form, some fields that have radio buttons don't have the check mark or any of the options. I was wondering if I have to remove the radio buttons and upload a brand new form to get them to work.

One thing, now that I have changed some of the text I have in the form, it won't load. It shows blank spaces and only one "thank you page" box shows, it does not show the pictures that I had loaded previously. I checked all the boxes on "Edit Options" in order to see if they would load but none of them did. It is really bothering me that I have to go through this whole process again just to change a few text boxes and a photo that doesn't want to upload for me. And I am so close to getting it all back up...I hate to lose everything again.

hi nikki

1. in your form settings tab look at the field 'fields. I have the options listed below enabled and it works. This may solve your issue if you find all of the options are enabled and still not working.

2. If you want to change any form fields to what Word would be like open it up in word and just cut and paste the changes

Thanks so much Nigel! I just wanted to add that it really did help to have my original form in Word open. It was the first time I really could see what was going on with my form when I went through the tutorial, so now I don't need to open up all the other forms on my website to change how one form is loaded, it is enough just to view my form. Thanks so much for all your help! It was really discouraging to see that my form didn't want to upload. Everything seemed to be right. I am still doing the research and will let you know if I find anything. Thank you so much!

Hi Nigel, I just wanted to let you know that I was able to solve the issue with changing the size of the form images. It was really frustrating, and it was kind of impossible for me to resize and crop the images. Once I did everything for my page, I was able to get it working...Thank you so much for your help! It was a life saver!
