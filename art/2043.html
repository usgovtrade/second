You can always use the converter tool to convert PDF files to various formats.

A:

You can use OpenOffice to convert PDF to images. OpenOffice is a free office suite that includes a converter.

A:

The tool is included in the default installation of Adobe Acrobat Reader. Open Adobe Acrobat Reader, select FILE | Conversion to JPG.

You can also do it in the command line as demonstrated in the answer by @Basti, but since that requires installing third party software there is no reason not to install Adobe Acrobat if the program is freely available on your computer (as it is by default). 
On the other hand, the image program bundled with Mac OS is Preview and it does not have an equivalent to the tool included with Adobe Acrobat (though you can still use PDFSnap to export PDF files as images).
To create JPGs with Mac OS built-in Preview.app you can use QuickTime Pro, but that program is paid.

You can also use the program Irfanview, it includes a 'PDF to JPG' menu item, but it also does not include a batch image converter like the one in Adobe Acrobat. It also includes a JPG converter, but it doesn't produce the same results as the one included in Adobe Acrobat.
The results of the tools for making JPGs can be shown using any image viewer (built in or third-party). Preview.app's Preview window can be set to the Preview:PDF box so it shows only the preview images from the PDF instead of previews of the entire page.

The first option makes Preview.app only display images from the PDF and hides the rest.

The second option does not change the appearance of the Preview window in any way.

If you really want to know, you can also export the whole PDF to a PDF file by using Preview.app's Export As... menu.

The tool included in Adobe Acrobat is one of many programs included in the Acrobat Suite of products by Adobe Systems. You will need to use Adobe Acrobat Reader X to access the tool. The program can also be used in the free Acrobat Reader X if the Reader is installed (some users do not see it in the menus but it is always available in the application menu or the program file</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:53
