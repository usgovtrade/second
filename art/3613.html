But they probably will be fully developed by 2030." (Source: Dr. Michio Kaku's Ted Talk, 2012)

2030 by 2030, it's "business as usual." (Source: World Health Organization/Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Twitter, 2016)

The time when a computer in the future will match or exceed the speed of a human's intellect is getting closer and closer to present time. A computer will even win against a professional Go player in a few years, as long as the computer can beat human opponents using a machine learning system. Human beings, of course, will go from being a commodity to a rare species.

Of course, an AI that is smarter than human beings by 2030 is just a mere AI like humans today, which can't make new human babies and then reproduce. Therefore, it will be difficult to say that the future will be entirely a new life, a new era, or a whole new world, because they will probably be replaced by new worlds and new lives as we know them.

New worlds and new lives will emerge only through AI robots, like androids or bionic men, who will use AI robots for their organs. Therefore, with these new life creations, we will lose our personal identity and our souls. There is a new race to come out with a new human being to be called a cyborg. A robotic head and a robotic body will be connected to become one complete life in order to survive and have a "feel" of humanity.

There will be a great shortage of resources in the future. In 2010, Stephen Hawking warned that humans had only 100 years to avoid the risk of being destroyed by our own hand. In a way, this kind of catastrophe will lead to the creation of the technological singularity. In a world of overpopulation and overconsumption, which means, our nature, as AI or robots, will be programmed to help the human race survive to the end. If this world will be overpopulated and overconsumed by 2030, then there will be two options: Either a new planet is to be discovered or the human race needs to go into space, not only in NASA's new space missions, but for those missions with AI spacecrafts or robots who are stronger and smarter than us.

If we can't control AI in the future, then a new generation of gods will exist in the next few years. In fact, Google's DeepMind computer system that beat the human world champion at the Atari game using neural networks will become intelligent enough to beat human players at the real-life games such as Scrabble, Go, and Chess. The next generation of AI will be more advanced than DeepMind.

By 2030, there will be another kind of singularity, which can't be compared with the singularity of the technological singularity. In this new kind of singularity, human beings will not be replaced or displaced by a new human being or life. Instead, humans will become more creative and their intellectual ability will be so high that we will think, learn, and play the games that are created by AI. AI, in fact, will be so advanced that our intelligence will be so high, we will then go into the future of an "intelligence singularity" that will never allow us to replace AI with human beings.

This is the last time to talk about human life in the technological singularity as we know it in 2030. There is nothing that will be possible in the future if we are still living on this earth.

## What Do You Think?

Is this singularity real and can you imagine what it would be like? If you were an alien from another planet looking for intelligent life in the universe, how would you define our humanity? Or do you think that we are humans simply because we are all very similar?

Would you agree with the argument that our humanity is not defined by a single word but by our different opinions? For example, how would an alien define human beings, when you think about all these different life forms?

Would an alien believe that humans are too lazy to create new life? Or are we the creators of life?

## Humanity: What Do You Think?

What about the question "Is humanity dead?" Who is to blame for this? And is it possible to create new life with AI robots or androids in the future? Is it possible to build new life without human reproduction?

Do you think that we can replace humanity with machines? Or will we still be around in 2030 to witness our own destruction?

# Acknowledgments

In the past few years, I have talked to a lot of people about my book, _Superhuman by 2030._

I must say that I have been extremely lucky to be able to interact with so many people. In particular, the many friends, followers, book reviewers, and reviewers who have helped and influenced this project have made this book better than it was when I wrote it.

There is one individual in particular who has been more than helpful. This special person is the person I call my muse. This person did not get his name or his title on the book. But he has been a constant presence in my life. This person not only inspired me but also inspired me to write this book. If you read this book, please make sure that this person knows that he has been our muse. This person will see this book on Amazon and give me some help, which I very much need at the moment.

If you write a book, you can be your own best friend, editor, or worst enemy. I hope that you'll be my best friend and editor. I also hope that you'll help make this book even better than it is.

To all my fellow AI enthusiasts and innovators in the world, thank you for being a part of the evolution and revolution of AI. I appreciate your commitment and dedication to this path. The next decade will be the most exciting time in history.

There are so many people who have influenced this book. If you know them, please let them know that I am a huge fan of their work.

You should also know that you helped me. I hope you have enjoyed reading _Superhuman by 2030_ and this special section.

I have enjoyed sharing this book with you. It has been a very intense process, but it has been really satisfying. If I can write and publish a book and get some feedback from the book lovers, I'd feel like I've done something more than what I should do. I hope that you have enjoyed this book and this section. If you have any comments or feedback, I would like to hear from you. Thanks for helping me with my books. I'll be working hard in the future.

If you are interested in reading more about my other books, my first book, _A User's Guide to the Brain,_ has been published in China. This book has a simple concept in mind—to introduce knowledge about the brain in a simple, easy-to-understand manner.

The next book will be _The Brain: How It Works and Why We Think So Differently._ The book will explore the biological and scientific basis of human behavior, which is how the brain works and why the human brain thinks differently from most other animals. I hope that the book will help explain human behavior in a simple way.

Now, what's next? As you might have figured out by now, I'm going to write another book in the future about the future. My next book will be about the future of the book! So stay tuned and read more about the future of the books.

Now, it's time to end this book. I hope you enjoyed reading _Superhuman by 2030_ and the entire new section. Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed this part. See you soon!
