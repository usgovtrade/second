Often called the Marquesas Islands, there are eight unique archipelagos located here. Each island offers a unique combination of people, terrain, terrain and climate, and wildlife. Some of the islands are steep with towering trees at the top and the entire island is covered in shrub and tree vegetation. While other islands are flat and treeless, with just a little grass growing in a few places. Each island has its own rich history that can only be learned when you spend time on them.

The best time to go to the Marquesas is December through May, because that’s when the weather is the warmest and driest. This is also when most of the boats leave.

Marquesas Islands

A 3 Night/4 Day Trip

This adventure begins in the morning at Nuku Hiva island, where you will be picked up by your captain and taken on a catamaran to Motu Tocho. Next, visit Motu Tocho, Tongariki, Motu Ura, Motu Nui, Anapai, Teao, Motu Teavaenikai, and Motu Kao. A picnic lunch will be served on each island. Spend the afternoon sailing back to Nuku Hiva to return to our office to end the day.

This adventure begins in the morning with a transfer to Motu Nui by car. You will be driven to Pokaikai Bay, the entrance to the Motu and are welcome to take a kayak to explore. In the afternoon, visit Motu Hauo and Motu Arai. After a picnic lunch you will be driven back to the beach and bade a fond farewell to the team.

Our Guided Experiences and Small Group Adventures allow you to experience remote areas of the world on a private basis. This allows you to avoid long lines, to maximize your vacation time and to select the accommodations that meet your needs. All accommodations are private and are comprised of a combination of en suite rooms, smaller bedrooms, bunk rooms and hammocks.

All meals are included for our group travelers (not included for independent travelers). A typical day begins with a delicious buffet-style breakfast in the hotel’s dining room. After breakfast we take a walk through the village, to the pier or through nearby forests. Then we return to the hotel to prepare lunch, and to take a leisurely walk in the forest or along the beach.

You will spend 3 to 4 days on the islands depending on which itinerary you choose. From November through May, the hottest and driest months, many of the islands have regular power, cell service and Internet connections, so you can communicate as needed.

Independent Travelers (who join a group):

The independent traveler typically joins an existing trip in a group of 6 to 15 participants. When joining a group, your group leader, along with other guides, works together with our staff to ensure that the group’s experience is as planned. As the individual in a group, you may or may not interact with your group. However, you may benefit from being on a group trip with others who have the same interests or desire to share the experience. Please feel free to join or not join as you choose.
