"I'm sure not all of them. There were some that we picked up, that we did a lot of the initial development on because there were a couple of them where it was just going to be a bunch of guys hanging out. There were a couple of those that were sort of just a concept, where it was just an idea of a show, so we were able to do that. There was one, for instance, where it was a guy who was a chef, and he was a big meat guy. We found all the recipes that he used to eat on the job, and as the show evolved he kept them in his pocket in different compartments of the show. So every time we wanted him to go into this area he had to look down in his pocket, find the right one. We did some of that stuff. There were things where we'd find just a random little sketch, or maybe they'd already written in the back of a notebook where they had all the characters' names, and they just hadn't even fleshed them out into full characters or anything. So it was one of those things where it was just a matter of getting an idea, and then they'd send us that, and we would keep working on it, and then maybe we'd send them back a script, maybe we'd sent them a script, and they'd give us notes. It was usually the notes that would give us the ideas. They're the ones that are the most fun, because they're not only giving us notes, they're really giving us notes. Some of them would do it with drawings, or they'd say, 'I know you didn't put this in there, but I think it would be funny if...' They're the ones that really gave us a lot of stuff for the show. And then, I think one of the reasons why we ended up going with HBO instead of Cinemax, was because all of a sudden we were writing more, and then we were writing for longer periods of time and really diving in on it, so there was no such thing as a small part. It was one of those things that when you come up with an idea, we'd find out, let's say, the biker gang, all of them on motorcycles, that had these little leather masks and they had a big thing going, and I had this idea, 'Well what if, as they're chasing the bad guy, their leader had broken a leg or something?' And the biker who had the broken leg had to go for medical treatment or something, and he was out of it and they were out there on the motorcycle and the guy comes back. 'That would be funny.' So that became the story 'Sons of Butcher'. So we started throwing in all these little ideas, and little things that were going to be fun, so it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun to get something from them and give it back to them, but it was a challenge, because at times they would just start throwing in whole storylines. They did it a couple of times. And one time it was a guy who was a lawyer, who worked for a huge, multi-national corporation and he was the son of the head of the company, but that guy was going to be out of work and they needed the money for the corporation, so he was going to do something illegal, or something like that. We said, 'No, you can't do this,' but it was fun. The funniest ones I think are the ones you didn't know about until you saw it on the air. We did an idea for the first time with Joe Mantegna's character in 'The Job', when he said 'Oh, by the way, while I'm out, I'm going to do a special on the weekend for my daughter's school and they'll be showing it in the lounge. Please sit down to watch it.' That's a story that never got shown, but was written up. The idea was he would tell them, the students would sit down to watch it and watch him fall in love with a woman, and this woman would be somebody that he worked with, and they would go to this club in the next town over and they would both get drunk and dance together and it would be the end. They thought it was too much violence for an elementary school, and then we wrote that one where he's having an affair with his niece. They liked that one a lot better."
