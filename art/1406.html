The video stars Matthew West and is an uplifting, feel-good story about the power of hope and the victory of the faith.

On Nov. 17, 2012, West appeared on "The 700 Club" with Pat Robertson. In this interview, West explains how the video was funded and the response that it received.

When did you make the decision to make this "I Have Hope" video?

Matthew West: We filmed it over the course of about a month. We had a vision to shoot a music video that had a story of a young boy and his grandfather. The boy could sense there was something wrong with his life -- his heart was empty. His grandfather had some life issues himself, but he loved God and Jesus and the boy followed him and looked up to him. They lived in a time of persecution in Russia when the children were told they had to renounce their faith. The child's grandfather taught him a simple prayer that he could never forget. This was how the film started.

Where were you when you made it?

West: We were actually at the Cedar Springs Center in Tennessee. We had just gotten back from filming a Christmas concert in Australia in front of about 15,000 people, singing the brand-new song "Million Eyes."

How did you go about making the video?

West: We tried to keep it under one thousand dollars and under 12 weeks. I filmed it over four days. We had a camera-guy named Adam Lustig who worked at our label. He had been a film student at one of the best film schools in the world and came back. He had done music videos for some of my other music videos. We basically set up a camera on a tripod, a camera on a dolly, and shot it all handheld.

I do the sound. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm a fan of John Mayer. I just kind of cranked the levels up high. (laughs)

What did your daughter say about the video?

West: She was 11 when I shot this video, so it was a little bit more of a child's perspective on it, but she is really sweet and she loved it and she is looking forward to seeing it when it comes out.

What else was shooting "I Have Hope" like?

West: I was worried about the fact that I had never worked with a videographer before, so I was very hands-on in the actual shooting. But it's not a big, loud scene and it didn't take a lot of time to shoot. But I did have to do some really good editing work. You can tell in the video, I was having fun playing with a lot of the techniques that John Mettra and the team at [post-production company] OMFilms helped me with. It was the first time we had been to their offices. We filmed it over the course of a weekend.

Where does "I Have Hope" fit in with your other music?

West: I think "I Have Hope" will definitely do very well in the Christian market, although it's an album of the big-picture, you know? It's not just a worship album, or just a single. The main thing is to make sure people know this is a believer's album. I have a lot of love for people who are not believers. It's a matter of them hearing a believer who understands their pain and how it feels. People will say, "Matthew, I could never stand in front of an audience and say 'I have hope' to people, and let them know it's OK to be broken and not so pretty. And yet I have a Savior who took my place."

"I Have Hope" talks about how the Lord has your back and we have to love people, as they're living in tough situations. What I saw in this situation is that I have hope and He has me in mind, and He will get me through.

When the video was done, did it feel like a miracle?

West: I can't say that I felt like it was a miracle at the moment because I was just worried about how I was going to pay for it. Once it was on the Internet, it really felt like it was a miracle.

How did you decide what would happen in the video?

West: We tried to write it out. We had a lot of talk about it and how we were going to put it together. We didn't really know that there would be such a big response, and I think that's one thing that you could learn about doing a film -- you never know what the response is going to be.

When I was at the Cedar Springs Center, I could see our production people were getting really excited about it. They were texting me every hour. They were telling me that it had gone viral and all this stuff, but there was so much pressure because I was doing a project with a budget of just $1,200. You know what it's like, you think you have a budget that's great but it feels like it's still $1,000 short.

If it was all over YouTube, I would just assume you put it up, because you can use your own money and you don't have to pay the full rate for YouTube. (Editor's note: YouTube takes about 10 percent of your revenue in ads.) But if it was put up on YouTube with my face and there was a copyright infringement, I could have somebody knocking on my door. So it was nerve-racking because I didn't want it to go up on YouTube.

Any response from anyone you'd like to mention?

West: I'd like to thank my management team at Provident Music Group. I'd like to thank our public relations and management team, because without their help this would have been a bigger miracle than it has turned out to be.

The "I Have Hope" video was a fun video to make. There is a child's perspective in the video, and the message is a reminder that our Savior loves us and that he will get us through. People have told me they were moved by the song and have felt that they could relate to it.

The reason I say it's a "fun video" is because we got to meet a lot of cool people. In the music business, that's the one thing that everyone always has to get. To say that it was fun would be an understatement. We had a lot of people come in and help us do it, and we had this big guy who helped us do it. We would just try to have fun with it, keep the energy up, and have fun with it. So, just like with the music, I think people who make God-honoring music, they are just as passionate about the music that God put in them as much as we are passionate about how music is coming out and as much as the fans are passionate about it.

Matthew West appeared on the "700 Club" with Pat Robertson to promote his new album, "I Have Hope." The album and video were inspired by one of West's songs, "I Have Hope," which discusses the power of hope and believing in a God who gets you through tough situations.

It may seem as if President Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney would be on friendly terms since their respective families have been friends for years.

The president calls former Gov. Mitt Romney's father "one of my most trusted advisers" and his mother "an inspiration to all of us." But that friendly history between the two families doesn't extend to political views and issues, especially when it comes to the auto industry.

A year ago, Romney opposed the $14 billion in government funds Obama's providing for job retraining and helping the victims of the economic downturn. He has since agreed to $21 billion in such spending.

"When I said that we can't kill Osama bin Laden, that we need to get the boys and girls who've been there done there and bring them home, it's clear that there was a commitment to get to that," Obama said in the second presidential debate on Oct. 16, 2012.

"To think that somebody hasn't changed their view on this issue in the last 10 months is not being attentive. It's really, really disconcerting," he said.

"I don't agree that all the changes he's talked about that he's working on, I don't agree that they're as fast as people would like them to be. It's fair to say that he's in there fighting for changes. There is no question. They are not as fast as people would like to see. There is absolutely no doubt about it," Romney told Fox News host Chris Wallace on Oct. 3, 2012.

"The president went on national television and he said, I'm going to kill bin Laden, or I'm going to get Osama bin Laden, and he did it," Romney said.

"He had four months to do it and it took him five and a half years, I suspect something went wrong in Pakistan," Romney said of bin Laden. "President Obama gets it right away. You know, he went out and said he got bin Laden, which is a pretty big deal and deserved."

Obama, who made remarks at the second debate that have since become the biggest meme in the Internet, told Romney he was "the last</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:54
