School Holiday Programs

Bunk Camp

The Bunk Camp program is currently held at the Gold Coast. It is a camp for boys and girls from Years 4 – 12, which offers an opportunity for participants to get away from the everyday routine and develop self-reliance and independence. Each day is spent exploring, developing friendships, and having fun!

Themed Camp- Days and Nights in the Forest

Themed Camp- Days and Nights in the Forest is held over five days during the school term and can be provided on the Gold Coast, Cedar Creek or Mareeba.

The program is aimed at providing an ideal opportunity for young people to engage in learning activities while having fun and experiencing outdoor activities. This will also provide a unique experience of camping in a residential camp situation away from home and other distractions. The program focuses on developing life skills such as developing positive social skills, understanding cultural differences, managing fear of new situations and the ability to trust and accept people.

Day and Night Camps

Day and Night Camps are offered as a school holiday program and during school term at a range of locations. The camp is a unique experience where children are able to experience first hand the vast natural environment of Cairns. The Camp provides an ideal experience for children to participate in a wide variety of activities that they may not be able to access elsewhere.

Our day camps include a variety of activities ranging from water games, horse riding, canoeing, games and activities as well as morning assembly. Our programs aim to develop important life skills such as leadership and cooperation, while enhancing curiosity and learning. Our programs are available during the week to cater for school holiday programs.
