The food is made with almonds, peanuts, and other plants that are similar to soy, a key ingredient in most processed meats. Tofurkey provides nearly the same amount of protein, fiber, and amino acids as real chicken. But tofu is high in protein, and I don't expect everyone to drop every processed protein and go totally vegan. Beyond Meat is good in dishes like tacos or on a sandwich.

This is also a good breakfast for vegans. For just 20 calories, I get 6 grams of protein and I didn't miss the meat much. The texture is much better than I expected, and I think they have some great flavors.

Pumpkin Pie Oatmeal

2 cups (475 ml) unsweetened vanilla plant milk

1/2 cup (75 g) uncooked rolled oats (or your favorite quick cooking oats)

1/2 cup (120 ml) canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)

1 tablespoon (10 g) ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Dash of salt

1/2 cup (55 g) dark brown sugar

1/4 cup (45 g) packed dark brown sugar

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

2 tablespoons (24 g) chopped pecans or walnuts

Makes 2 servings

This recipe uses pumpkin puree in a new and different way. Using it instead of an egg in a traditional pumpkin pie recipe, this recipe is also vegan and low in fat. You can also add some blueberries if you prefer.

Chop a whole nut into pieces. Mix all of the ingredients, except the nuts, in a medium saucepan. Let simmer for 5 minutes, then add the nuts and stir until the nuts are coated. Simmer for another 3 to 5 minutes. You can pour it into bowls and sprinkle with the nuts or serve hot. The warm flavor gives a nice balance to some cold foods.

Spiced Pecans

1/4 cup (50 g) honey

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom

1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

2 cups (220 g) pecans

Makes 2 cups (110 g)

These are a great addition to oatmeal, or as a snack. If you add cinnamon, you won't miss the added sugar or fats. A half-cup serving has 17 grams of protein and is low in fat.

Preheat oven to 300ºF (150ºC, gas mark 2). Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl. Spread on a baking sheet in a single layer and bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until it reaches the desired doneness. Turn down heat to 250ºF (120ºC, gas mark 1) and bake for another 45 minutes. When done, place the pan in the oven to keep warm for a couple of hours, until serving time.

Spiced Pepitas

2 tablespoons (30 ml) canola oil

2 tablespoons (28 g) packed brown sugar

2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

2 cups (220 g) raw unsalted pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds), optional

2 cups (110 g) whole pecans

1/2 cup (75 g) dark chocolate chips (sugar free)

1/2 cup (62 g) unsweetened cocoa powder

1/2 cup (88 g) raisins (sugar free)

1/4 cup (25 g) slivered almonds

1/4 cup (57 g) coconut flakes

1/4 cup (40 g) unsweetened coconut flakes

Makes 2 cups (110 g)

Pepitas are one of my favorite snacks. These are a little sweet and full of protein. Mix the rest of the ingredients together and toss into an airtight container.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Granola

2 cups (110 g) plain oatmeal (or 1/2 cup [120 ml] dry oats)

1/4 cup (50 g) brown sugar

1/4 cup (60 g) brown sugar, lightly packed

1/4 cup (60 ml) canola oil

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/8 teaspoon allspice

3 cups (440 g) bran flakes cereal (or wheat flakes)

3 cups (400 g) chocolate chips (sugar free)

Makes 8 servings

I use this as a quick breakfast cereal. You can just add the ingredients in the bowl and enjoy the toasty flavors, or you can eat it with milk like a cereal.

Preheat oven to 300ºF (150ºC, gas mark 2). Mix all of the ingredients except the bran flakes in a bowl. Stir in the bran flakes and pour onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Spread out in an even layer and bake for about 10 minutes. Turn oven down to 275ºF (135ºC, gas mark 1) and bake for another 15 minutes. Take out and let it cool down. Enjoy!

Chocolate Peanut Butter Crispy Treats

2 cups (220 g) dry oats, quick or rolled

3/4 cup (130 g) smooth natural peanut butter

1/4 cup (60 ml) honey

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/2 cup (75 g) dark chocolate chips (or dark chocolate), optional

Makes 4 cups (960 g)

This recipe makes a crunchy, lightly sweet cereal snack. I love it and can't wait to have it for breakfast. You can use milk or water instead of almond milk for added nutrients.

Preheat oven to 275ºF (135ºC, gas mark 1). Prepare the cups in a baking pan. Mix all of the ingredients except the chocolate chips in a bowl. Spread the mixture evenly in the cups and sprinkle with chocolate chips. Bake for about 30 minutes.

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Chocolate Granola Clusters

2 cups (290 g) dry oats, quick or rolled

1/2 cup (96 g) dark chocolate chips (or dark chocolate), optional

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

2 teaspoons oil

2 teaspoons honey

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 cup (25 g) slivered almonds

Makes 4 servings

These are really easy and make a great breakfast or snack. Feel free to add or substitute any other flavorings, like lemon zest. Or you can substitute part of the olive oil for peanut oil, if you like. If you do use peanut oil, be sure to use one that is free of added oils or sugars. It can be found in your grocery store's health-food section or in the Asian food section.

Preheat oven to 275ºF (135ºC, gas mark 1). Prepare the cups in a baking pan. Mix all of the ingredients except the chocolate chips in a bowl. Spread the mixture evenly in the cups and sprinkle with chocolate chips. Bake for about 30 minutes. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Chocolate Strawberry Muffins

1 cup (240 g) canned pureed strawberries (not pie filling)

3/4 cup (90 g) dry oats, quick or rolled

1/2 cup (100 g) frozen wild blueberries or raisins

1 egg, lightly beaten

1 tablespoon (15 ml) honey

2 tablespoons (24 g) cocoa powder

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 cup (30 g) coconut flakes, optional

1/4 cup (28 g) dark chocolate chips (sugar free)

Makes 16 muffins

Making muffins is much easier than you might think, and you can keep them warm in a low oven if you have a lot of guests. You can also freeze them for later use. If you do freeze them, remember to change the paper when reheating. This recipe uses the strawberries to make it even more fun for the kids.

Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC, gas mark 4). Prepare muffin cups in paper cups and coat lightly with cooking spray or oil.

Combine all of the ingredients, except the coconut and chocolate chips, in a bowl. Pour into the paper muffin cups. Bake for 20 minutes or until the muffins are brown. Remove from the oven and let cool. For the coconut flakes, spread the coconut flakes evenly on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Place it in a 350ºF (180ºC, gas mark 4) oven until it starts to get lightly brown, about 10 minutes. Let the muffins cool a little, then sprinkle the tops with the coconut flakes and chocolate chips. Serve warm or at room temperature.
