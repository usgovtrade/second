It could lead to an inexpensive and potentially massive electric grid storage system. And by controlling the energy when it is stored, it could be safer than standard batteries that are susceptible to overheating and catching fire. And the list goes on and on.

Some are already suggesting graphene might be the key to new technological advancements such as wearable technology, flexible solar cells and sensors, and even the next generation of computers. It could also revolutionize medical technologies such as artificial skin, organs, and organs replacement.

But with graphene's potential comes its hazards and the potential for abuse. The fact that scientists in the US and China are able to produce graphene on the massive scale is also a problem.

Since 2010, Chinese factories have been churning out record amounts of graphene, and China's "graphene mania" has grown exponentially. Some experts believe this may be a sign that a global arms race is on the horizon.

While the U.S. government is making efforts to restrict the graphene rush, many other countries are already getting in on the act. In addition to a large amount of foreign demand, they are pumping in billions of dollars into research and infrastructure to support the race for graphene.

The race is on, with China, Canada, Brazil, and the UK vying for some of the market share. China even launched a $1 billion graphene investment fund for start-ups and big companies.

But with any research, there are risks. It's hard to say whether or not any individual country will succeed in the long-run, but it is still possible to identify which countries have potential and may have an edge.

And, since the research could result in technological advancements, it is worthwhile to see where the most promising research is being done and by whom.

Using data from the University of Manchester in the UK, we've looked at how much money is being invested in different countries and who is funding it.
