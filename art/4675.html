“Apparently the game wasn’t even the highlight of the evening,” Fort Worth Police spokesman Officer Daniel Segura said at a press conference at police headquarters in downtown Fort Worth.

The fight began in the parking lot of McFaddin’s Bar and Grill near Arlington on the south side of Interstate 35W, a popular bar that advertises itself as “The place to cheer on the Chiefs.”

Segura said the fight began when one group — not yet identified — was shouting racial slurs toward a second group who were having a party at a birthday party on the other side of the bar.

That led to words between one person from the birthday party and the people from the first group, Segura said. The birthday party attendees exited the bar and the trouble began.

“They were all unruly, unruly to the point of refusing to follow officers commands. They refused to leave the scene. It became a safety issue,” Segura said.

Segura said multiple shots were fired, but he could not say how many or by whom. One man who called himself a member of the birthday party but was standing in front of the bar during the shooting identified himself as Jonathan. He said he didn’t know any of those involved.

“Why would anyone shoot gunshots in a bar in Fort Worth,” he asked.

When the officers tried to arrest one member of the birthday party, that man pulled away from officers.

“He had an injury, he was bleeding and they had to Tase him to get him to comply,” Segura said.

By the time police were able to move the man’s bleeding body into the back of a patrol car, the brawl had become uncontrollable, Segura said. The man’s condition was not immediately known.

Once the fighting moved to the street, vehicles were backed over, and windows were smashed.

Police, who said they used chemical agents, pepper spray and Tasers against the crowd, arrested 23 people, 11 of them juveniles.

The party attendee who identified himself as Jonathan — he said he couldn’t give his real name for fear of retaliation — said there were a few who wanted to fight but no more than five.

“It was getting out of hand,” he said. “That’s what got people to going. There were plenty of people who tried to calm it down.”

Segura said the investigation is ongoing and that anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Fort Worth police at 817-392-4424 or anonymously call Crime Stoppers at 817-469-TIPS.
