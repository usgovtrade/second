the need to find an alternative to EOL as soon as possible. The 
current problems experienced with EOL have shown that Enron have 
to speed up their development and their implementation by increasing 
the number of employees dedicated to the project. The cost of this 
provision cannot be underestimated. The lack of confidence between 
traders and Enron have cost the company at least one billion dollars 
(the market has moved from 60 million dollars monthly average to 
less than 10 million dollars). What was the cause of the delay? The 
cause was the inability to guarantee an operating capacity at least 
equal to Enron's trading volume on behalf of the developers. In fact, 
our internal volumes on the EOL are only 50% of the volumes traded. 
To solve this problem, Enron developed a software platform allowing 
banks to make markets with Enron but with the condition that if 
Enron's volumes are under-utilized (as stated above), the banks' 
volumes will also be under-utilized. It is therefore natural that 
banks will not accept the responsibility of providing liquidity to 
the market if Enron is not the same confident. We now have the 
responsibility to find a way to operate the system even if Enron 
fails to implement the system. We believe that we need to 
construct a system which will: 
(a) allow Enron to provide liquidity to the market while 
(b) enable banks to operate Enron's system in case 
(c) make Enron's system more robust. 
These problems have been solved by the use of an automatic 
matching system in a distributed manner. The market maker's 
operation is not as the market maker, but as an 
intermediary/book-keeper. Similarly, Enron can be an 
intermediary/book-keeper, but without the obligation to provide 
liquidity to all market participants. This role can be 
automatically distributed to independent market-makers in case 
Enron fails to do so. However, in order for banks to remain active, 
Enron must give to banks the tools to operate Enron's system and in 
particular the tools to manage the counterparty credit risk. 

(c) Enron's future as a Market Operator 

When Enron can become the market-maker of choice for many 
counterparties by being able to operate the system of the 
counterparties, it will create new business opportunities in many 
other areas. 

What is this mean?

For example, there are many sites that Enron can bid on behalf of 
its customers. At the moment, the company does not buy or sell gas 
because it cannot make markets on EnronOnline. The proposed model 
allows Enron to buy and sell. If the counterparties are willing to 
hedge their positions with Enron, the prices will reflect the true 
values.

An example will clearly show the point. A customer wants to buy some 
3 year natural gas from Enron's suppliers (or traders). The 
customers' price is the price set by the inter-regional bid-based 
markets and agreed with Enron's suppliers. Enron's margin will 
depend on the management of the counterparty credit risk.

To become the market-maker of choice for its customers and 
counterparties, the company must allow its customers to 
manipulate prices if they are willing to do so. A way for the 
counterparty to manage the price risk is to use call options 
(option to buy or sell) to manage the position risk. This 
operation will allow the customer to lock the price risk at the 
price set by Enron and the option to purchase the gas at the current 
price. The operation is very similar to the energy basket 
construction if we consider the futures contract as the energy 
basket. 

This is the proposed business model in case Enron wants to play 
the role of the market-maker of choice. The main drivers for 
Enron's business are the following: 
(1) become the market-maker of choice for its customers 
(2) allow customers to manage their positions by acting through 
its market making entity, in the same way market makers manage 
the positions of their customers. 

The management of the positions will generate a control on the 
counterparty credit risk by allowing the customers to modify 
liquidity/ funding and cash flow positions, i.e., time and 
collateral requirements. As a consequence, the system can be 
implemented without a haircut for the banks. 

This is a proposal of the future of Enron's business. We are 
looking at various type of structures and legal agreements with 
Enron (including bankruptcy). We hope to be able to explore more 
this issue and propose further improvements in the trading system. 
The implementation of this structure will not eliminate all risks. 
The company's management must be aware of the risks that are 
inherent in the trading operations. 

(d) Collateral management solution.

The main risk in the trading operations is related to the absence 
of collateral and to the haircut applied on the defaulting parties. 
A structure in which the defaulting party is going to be forced to 
sell part of its positions to the market-maker is eliminating the 
risk from the system. The collateral received from the market 
maker for the hedged position will allow the defaulting party to 
meet its obligations and keep on trading. The collateral can be 
either in the form of futures contracts (in case Enron acts as the 
market-maker of choice), or cash/insurance in the case in which 
Enron acts as an agent. 

The collateral management should be performed by a &true8 
market-maker or by a regulated market-maker (or swap dealers in 
the US). The collateral management procedure is as follows: 
(1) Enron will set-off the mark-to-market of the portfolio sold to 
Enron against Enron's risk-free position. If the mark-to-market 
of the portfolio is higher than the offsetting Enron's risk free 
position, Enron will buy futures contracts with the counterparty 
and transfer the position to the third party (default management 
agent or a bank) for settlement. In the case Enron acts as a 
market maker of choice, the transactions must be cleared through 
an Enron subsidiary. (2) Enron will close out all positions managed 
by the third party. Enron will give the third party an option 
(call option) on Enron's portfolio (which is a combination of 
futures and/or insurance). The call option should be written for 
a period of one year and must be settled at the option's inception 
date. The option will have a strike equal to Enron's risk-free 
rate plus an additional 20% margin, and a time value of zero. The 
premiums on the option will be equal to the mark-to-market 
exceeding the mark-to-market of the portfolio. The call option 
value will therefore be equal to the market value of the portfolio 
(the total value minus the shortfall of Enron's risk-free position). 

Example 1: Enron is long 1000 MWh in a region with a settlement 
of day-ahead market. The mark-to-market position on day a is 400 
MWh. Enron's risk-free position is short 500 MWh. Enron will close 
the position by buying 500 MWh and write an option for a net 
shortfall of 500 MWh. 

Example 2: Enron is long 1000 MWh in a region with a settlement 
of day-ahead market. The market maker position on day a is 750 
MWh. Enron's risk-free position is short 200 MWh. Enron will close 
the position by buying 200 MWh and write an option for a net 
shortfall of 500 MWh. 

Example 3: Enron is short 1000 MWh in a region with a settlement 
of day-ahead market. The market maker position on day a is 750 
MWh. Enron's risk-free position is short 200 MWh. Enron will close 
the position by selling 200 MWh and write an option for a net 
shortfall of 500 MWh. The portfolio is long 700 MWh and short 300 
MWh. 

The risk-free position is used as the reference portfolio and the 
call option is written on Enron's position. The portfolio to be 
managed is Enron's risk-free position. The strike price of the 
option is the sum of the risk-free rate and the initial margin. 
The price of the option is calculated by the following formula: 
C * (P^ strike * sqrt(T) + 1) * exp(-r * T) / (P * sqrt(T) * 
sqrt(T))

Where:

C is equal to 20%.

P is equal to the risk-free rate, which is defined as the U.S. 
Treasury Bill, three-month interest rate.

T is equal to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:19
