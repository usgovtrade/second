When I watch TV or a video, I can always count on
“The Bitchy Waiter.”
That’s right, if I have a bad day, I can
always go home and watch this show, which
is a comedy based on the idea of a restaurant
waiter, played by Robert Wagner, who is really a
professional actor and also an asshole, and is
always going to have an attitude with the other
people in the restaurant. He seems to have a
problem with anyone but his fiancé, who is a
waitress in the restaurant he works in and is
played by Marilu Henner. They play the usual
couple together, which, while they are the only
ones in the restaurant, makes it funny to watch.
If you like the old days of Benny Hill, you will
really get a kick out of this show. (It is
available on Amazon, Hulu, etc.)

For those who like TV comedies, it’s funnier
than most comedies on TV, and I give it five
stars, but I don’t know if I’ll watch it
again. It’s nice to get a show that is
based on people who actually are like this in
real life. You don’t want to think of the
waiters you have seen in other places as being
the same as the one in the show. It’s just
impossible.

So, you want to laugh at something funny and if
you want it to be even more funny, turn on
“The Bitchy Waiter.” There is more about it at
http://www.tvguide.com/shows/the-bitchy-waiter/show
-description/341559.aspx?tcmark=1&r=
.com/tv/shows/the-bitchy-waiter/show-description/341559.aspx
. There is a website at http://www.thebitchywaiter.
com/ with more about the cast of “The Bitchy
Waiter” and other TV shows about waiters, which
you might also like to watch.

Another show, which I only knew about because
I read about it in Entertainment Weekly last
year was a lot of funnier and better than most
of the other shows I watched on that list. It
was a comedy from the 90s starring Matthew
Broderick, which I have never seen and might
never see. That shows how much I don’t watch
anything from the 90s.

The show was called “The Tick” and was about
a guy who has a weird brain injury and he is
an odd-looking character. He also wears this
costume that looks like it belongs to a character
from the circus, but he is a superhero who is a
good guy, but can also hurt people, because he
was brain damaged in a fire, so that when he is
in one of his many disguises, he cannot control
what he does. The weirdest character about him
is that he says that he talks to people in a
voice, but it’s really just the voice of the
person on the phone who he is talking to.

His sidekick is Arthur, who is a talking dog who
does not bark. The first time I saw this show,
I was laughing, because it was so absurd, and
I still find it very funny today. The actor who
played Arthur had a talking dog in his hands in
every episode, but you could never see the dog.
You saw only his hands, where his hands were.

I would recommend this show to anyone, but as I
say, you don’t want to think of the waiters
you see today as being like the ones in this
show. (It’s worth watching for the funniest
talking dog on TV.)

In closing, I remember reading about the show,
a mystery show on TV called “Forensic Files,”
which was also about an ex-cop, which I had
never heard of before. On “Forensic Files,” he
was not a cop. There were two women at the
other end of the phone talking to him about the
death of a woman named Kitty Genovese, who
was raped and killed in New York City, and they
tried to convince him that they knew who the
rapist and murderer was and that he was still
alive.

It was probably the funniest show I have ever
seen, because the women were not like anybody
you would ever meet, because the guy knew that
they were just talking about it and not telling
him anything. He kept pretending to know
everything, but he never really knew what was
going on. There was one scene when he got the
name of the killer from the person on the phone.
He pretended to find the name important, but
the name did not appear again.

Another show that you may like if you liked “The
Bitchy Waiter” was called “Everybody Loves
Raymond,” which was also on T.V. and starred
Ralph Kramden, which was a TV show that was
from the 1950s, and it was about the “perfect
hometown” where everybody knew everything about
everybody else, where no one did anything bad
or the police never got involved in anything,
and everybody was happy about it. But it was
about a guy named Raymond Barone, who was about
a 50s like that.

I have to say, if I were you, I wouldn’t want to
sit next to a woman who likes this show about a
guy in a crazy town.

He only sees it in dreams and has never seen it
in real life. I know. You are saying, “But he
has seen her and met her,” but in this story,
he doesn’t see her at all, as I said in a
previous letter.

In another story, he was told that he would
know her, but they lied to him, because it was
such a big deal when you got to meet someone,
but he never got to meet her. But here is what
I told him. “I have never heard of anyone who
got into college based on who they were, or
on how they could be someone who made a major
impact. So, you have probably never heard of
someone who got into college because of their
name or who they were.”

This happened in the mid-90s and some years ago.
You probably have never heard of the
person, and it may be difficult to find anything
about it. He could even be dead by now.

This would be a good time to take a break and
watch a few more shows before I write the next
letter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
And always remember to follow your heart and
never get involved with people who don’t believe
in you. Also, remember what President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt said, “The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself.”

I hope you will agree with me on this one and
remember to take responsibility for your life.
Good luck with your education. I want you to
have a good future, so keep up the good work,
my friend.

As I said, he had never read anything about
people who got into college based on how
they were and not what they did. A person has
to do something to get in. So, you have probably
never heard of people who got into college by
having a famous name or who they were.

Well, he had heard that there was a student in
college that got a big scholarship. I
was sure he would ask me who it was, but I
did not know who it was, because I do not follow
this kind of news. He said he knew that this
person got a scholarship based on who they
were. So, I told him that I really don’t know
anything about someone getting a scholarship
based on who they are. I only know about someone
who gets in based on the things they do and how
good they are at something. This</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:22
