Once </a></div><div class='nav'><a href='421.html'> << </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='424.html'> >> </a></div><div class='article'>Quitetly, Quiggly stepped into the darkness as he stealthily approached and steeled himself for battle.

When the time was right, Quiggly, in his normal size, stepped forth into the light and struck the demon with a blaze of fire, destroying it instantly, and with Quiggly’s sudden assault, he had saved the lives of the monks, and with Quiggly back at full strength, he destroyed the remaining demons and he was left wondering what he had ever been worried about.

The next day, Quiggly said he was going to go and rest, so he just spent the day around the inn, having many breakfasts and conversations with the monks, who were very happy to see that he was returned to full strength, and had been able to recover from whatever he went through to become so small.

In the days that followed, he and his friends were resting after battling with the fiend, Quiggly told them he would be leaving the next day, and went back to resting.

The next morning, Quiggly said his goodbyes to all of them, as he headed back to his village to report on what happened to the people and he would then go back to stay with his family and friends.

The next day, he returned to his village, where everyone in his village was glad to see that he was back and asked him what had happened. He told them the story of his adventures, and when he was finished, he spoke with everyone, as he learned that he’s been gone longer than he thought and everyone had been worried for him. Quiggly was then offered to live with a farmer’s family that had four children, and accepted, and they had raised him as their own child.

So ends the tale of the adventure of the young boy and his friends, though he was not really in danger, he did have a very hard time convincing the young prince of the village to allow him to stay and fight, until he convinced him to, and when he got back, everyone was very happy to see him and Quiggly was treated with the respect that he deserved.

Quiggly lived a very happy and long life, for many years after, when he was very old, he became a monk and lived for many years afterwards, he continued to lead monks into battle when they were needed. He stayed his old age, living as a monk, but he did live to old age and passed away one day after a very happy and long life.
