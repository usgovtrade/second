I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things." He looked at his watch. "Well, what are we waiting 
for?  Let's get the first group on its way." He motioned with his
hand. "Mr. Jameson, here is the route I want you to take. "Jameson
looked over the route.  "Why don't I take the first group out?  This
group will be on their way to the airport in about an hour and 
a half." he looked at a map on the wall. "Where exactly is this airport
located, Mr. Secretary?" He looked at the secretary who had a 
little map in his hand. "We have an airport about twenty miles 
away, sir.  It takes a while to get there. "If I will take this
group on my route, we will meet them at the airport." The secretary
had an idea. "Hey, if he can get his airplane, we will make the
group three times as strong."  "Well, I don't know how long the plane
will take him," he said, as he reached for his folder. He found
his airplane's number. "Mr. Jameson," he said, handing Jameson the
paper. "This should get you going in a hurry. " He picked up the
phone. "OK, Jameson, and tell the pilots to keep it quiet. They will
have to keep it low flying because of the trees around the lake."
Jameson nodded. "I will go right now and tell them. " The secretary
turned back to Peter. "I would like to know why they are stopping 
their project at all." He picked up the folder and looked inside. 
"I hope the President is not losing his marbles."
--- 
After the plane left, Peter took a deep breath. He saw the secretary 
glare at him. "You were right, sir. You are in for it now. 
"That's a good beginning for you. You just started my vacation."
The secretary looked at him like he was crazy. He was about to say
something, when he decided to start something else.
--- 
"A while ago, we had an intruder in our building, who took a lot of
money."
--- 
"And it happened in your office?" The secretary shook his head.
"What happened to him? " Peter asked. "He left our building and
did not say a word to anyone. 
"We have never heard from him since. "He looked at him
confidently.

--- 
The secretary shook his head again.
"It makes me a bit nervous when you stare at me like that." He
knew he had made a mistake with that statement. "I was just thinking
of how things will be when I leave. "He looked at Peter and waited
for a reaction. He did not get it.
Peter smiled, "Well, Mr. Secretary, I am sure you will be as famous
as you are now. 
"Mr. Secretary, you will not be as famous as you are now."
Peter watched as he reached for the phone. "What do you mean by that?"
"Did you ever ask the president who did the research? The answer is
us. You have been wasting time and energy. The president was a fool.
That is why I think he should have hired his cousin instead.
--- 
He hung up the phone. "The President did not know who did his research,
did he?" Peter picked up the phone. He decided to try the other
guy." He waited while he talked to someone else. "I want you to go
to that building where you first tested us. I want you to bring
the first group to a place I will tell you. " He put the phone
down. 
He stood up, "Well, we are done for today. Let's go." He pointed
to his empty plate. "I am glad you gave us two plates." He turned
and saw the secretary was eating the rest of his chicken. "Let's go. 
"I wonder where he is.

---

He was walking back to the office. "Hey, I thought you two took that
bus down. " He looked at Mike. "No. Somebody took us for a ride. We
left in that building. " He told them where to go. "We will be there
as soon as we can.
--- 
"All right, everyone to your places and ready. 
" I'll say!" Mike said. "They are gone already? "Jameson
looked at his watch. He turned around to the guy, "Get the truck
ready. We are moving." The two of them turned and ran out of the
building.

---

The secretary ran into the building. "Mike, get up here. I don't know
what is going on." He walked down the hall. "Damn it! Mr. Mike?
Mike? "Jameson turned to him. "Oh my, what is going on here?" 
He saw Mike and looked around. "This is not right. "Mike saw
him walk over to a door. "Get that door open!" He saw Mike reach
for the door. "I mean it, Mike! "He looked down the hallway to see
the door was open and no Mike. "What in the world has happened?"
--- 
"Peter, where are you?" The secretary looked around. He tried to find
out where Peter could be. "Hey, don't stand there. Get down to
the lab." Mike, he heard a voice he knew. He slowly walked down
the hallway. He heard voices coming from the laboratory. "How in the
world did they get out?" He walked into the laboratory and looked
at Peter. He gave him a pat on the back and then sat down. "Are you
out of your mind, sir? "He walked over to Peter. "What did you do,
sir? " He started to get up when he felt the chair next to him move
up. "Well, what is this? A chair next to me? "He looked up to see
Sanchez and Mike. "Don't you boys know that I do not want to be
here. If the president sees me I will be fired." He took a deep
breath. "Is this a trick, sir? "He looked around. "You guys are
here. "He looked around. "What is going on? "He looked at Mike.
"Mr. Jameson, get up and get out of this chair. "He got up. He was
in no mood for jokes. "You guys, if I do not get my ass out of this
chair, I will get you fired. You do not want me to get fired, do
you?" "Mr. Secretary, it is all right. You know how much we need
your help." Mike walked up to him. "Let's go." Mike grabbed
his arm. "Mike, do you know how that old man feels about being
touched. " He shook off Mike. "My God, sir, he just saved your life. "Mike
grabbed his arm again. "But, he did not like to be touched." He
turned and saw Sanchez. "Are you seeing this? I am not a piece of
cheese, and I do not like to be touched."

---

Jameson watched them walk down the hallway. He did not know why
they were carrying him. "Hey, I don't want to be carried like a baby. "He
stiffened when they stopped in front of the elevator. "They are taking me
up in an elevator. What happened to the stairs?" He looked at Mike.
"You took those stairs just yesterday. "He looked back at Mike. "Did
you bring me back here? "Mike gave him a strange look. "What do you
mean by that?" He looked at Mike. "You could not be doing that
to me, Mike. You really are a good guy. You are as decent as Peter.
You guys should have been brothers." He looked at them. "You guys are
not letting me down here. I did not tell you to bring me down here.
Get me out of here." Mike patted his back. "Hang on, sir, and let
us get you to your office. "
--- 
Jameson looked at the secretary. "This is not funny. "He waved
his hand. "I can't believe this. I did not even take any pills. " He
looked at the doctor. "Mr. Secretary, why is that man walking like
he is in a trance?" "Maybe because he did not do what I told him to
do. "He turned to see that the man on the table was awake and knew
his surroundings. "He was awake when he was brought here. I hope
you boys did not do anything that will get us all in trouble. 
Jameson looked at the secretary. "This is not funny. He knows
what he did. "He looked back at the doctor. "That is why I am so
puzzled why you would tell him to do it." He looked down. "I am sorry,</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:56
