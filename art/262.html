a restaurant, bar, lounge and banquet room. The building is located in the heart of 
the city at 25 S. Madison Street, at the corner of Washington Street and Jackson 
Street. Built in 1853, the historic building has undergone a complete restoration 
and now boasts high ceilings, intricate woodwork, original columns and stately 
chandeliers. The decor of the main room is reminiscent of Victorian era with 
colors of soft browns and tans. One cannot help but notice the beautiful parquet 
flooring which runs throughout the room. The restaurant seats between 40 and 
50 and opens to the bar, which can seat another 50 and is located adjacent to 
the large meeting room, where weddings and other private events are hosted. Joe's

definition TVs and a balcony which seats 35, offering another venue for private 
events. In the banquet room, the tables are set for up to 200 people. The 
banquet room has views of both Washington and Jackson Streets, and has sloped
