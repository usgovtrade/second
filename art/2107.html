It is never my intention to offend anyone or to try to diminish the feelings of any other mother, grandparent or any woman who has fought for equality and is making strides in our society. My intention is to provide information and encourage an open dialogue in order to prevent misinformation from becoming accepted as fact.

I have spent many years and much effort studying, participating and encouraging social equality. I have been working with the MIA to achieve change for our daughters. I am a supporter of President Clinton and the Democratic party.

I am a firm believer in the democratic process and the right for anyone to vote for a candidate or a party they support. I also believe it is my right to share my views and my experience with others.

It has not been a pleasant journey. I have been attacked and called names, I have lost friendships, I have been bullied and ostracized. When I am questioned as to my beliefs I am told that I don’t know anything about the subject. When I point out mistakes and misinformation I have been accused of trying to diminish the work of others, I have been called a bully and have been accused of trying to control others, of being divisive and of not sharing my opinions with others.

I have never taken a poll. My input and experience is my own and based on my beliefs and my faith. My opinions are only based on what I have observed and have learned. What the Bible says in these areas is not in doubt. What has been handed down in the written records and teachings of the church is not in dispute. I have never claimed or taught anything that is not taught in the Bible. I have never made statements that are not backed up in the Bible or other writings or my experiences with others who are experts in these areas.

My mission and objective in sharing my beliefs with you and others is not to diminish or denigrate you or your views. My mission is to provide you the information you seek so you will be informed. My objective is to educate. My motivation is to improve the quality of life for our daughters and families.

When a conversation about the subject of equal rights or parenting or politics, or politics or parenting with someone who has an opposite belief system from you, there are many things that are important to understand.

There are no excuses for being ignorant. It’s never acceptable to say that a woman was made for a man, it’s not acceptable to suggest a woman has no business working outside the home. It’s wrong to say or suggest that our daughters are a piece of property and should not be a part of our lives and activities. It is wrong to say</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:59
