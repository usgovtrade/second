We've compiled a list of things you can do to stop the attacks, whether you're a mom or a dad, a businessman, a teenager or a politician. Whatever your position or ability, we're sure you can do at least something to help - if not all, at least some.

For many of the attacks, there are things you can do that don't even take any time away from your daily routine. Click here for more.

Unfortunately, you can't just order up a batch of explosives to blow up a skyscraper, but explosives are definitely used to bring down a massive structure. Click here for more.

In 2012, a fertilizer plant blew up in the town of West, Texas, leaving a giant mushroom cloud that sent people scurrying for cover.

Even though the smoke wasn't visible because of the cloud, it still contained enough chemicals that could have caused the blaze. Click here for more.

The government of Venezuela and Chavez have refused to admit that Venezuela was at fault, although they made it clear that if it weren't for the United States and its neighbors, Venezuela would be a much different place.
