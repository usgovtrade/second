This week, a job seeker on Reddit named cactus said that he or she sent the following email to one of the companies:

“Good day to you! I have recently applied to several jobs that you advertise on your website and your company email server. I noticed you keep sending me information regarding these jobs through automatic email updates. Unfortunately I’m quite busy at the moment and cannot really check on the jobs anymore. Could you please stop sending these emails to me?”

And the following were the companies’ responses:

“I will definitely look into this,” said Microsoft.

“Thank you for your feedback and I am sorry to hear that you are so busy. If you’d like, you can remove yourself from our mailing list by going to http://careers.microsoft.com and selecting ‘unsubscribe from this mailing list’,” said the company.

And this was LinkedIn’s answer:

“Thanks for getting in touch with us. I’ll take a look and get back to you.”

And Monster replied, “Thank you for reaching out. Let me see what I can do for you. Thanks.”

And Indeed’s was much the same. It seemed pretty much universal.

A job seeker on Reddit said that his or her supervisor did the same thing. One supervisor who got burned a few times from the unsubscribe email was so happy that he sent it to the CEO of the company.

I did a search on Indeed for “unsubscribe from this mailing list” and indeed the email does exist as a result in the footer of the page. It also looks as though Indeed has been sending it to job seekers as of at least 2013.

The one who put this up on Reddit said that if the unsubscribe was not successful in removing the company from your inbox, then send them this Gmail template and ask them to make it public:

Hi, this is a job seeker at your company. Please stop sending me unsolicited job listing emails as I know I’m not your target market.

The commenter said that it worked for him.

In other words, if you don’t want someone else’s job list to come in your inbox, do what the companies in this article are doing: Unsubscribe.

Job seeker or a recruiter who wants to get rid of the same job recruiter? Start spamming job seeker’s and their employers with unsubscribe emails on LinkedIn and LinkedIn Answers. Don’t forget to change the subject line as well. How’s that for a blast from the past?

If you want to try sending emails, then I’d suggest looking up the company’s email addresses on this list of job recruiters who are spamming job seekers on Linkedin: 20+ Companies Spamming Job Seekers.
