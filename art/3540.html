Like any living thing, hurricanes are subject to random acts of violence such as natural disaster and global warming. In 2004, Hurricane Charley devastated the Tampa Bay Area, which sits in the heart of "the hurricane alley". The following year, Hurricane Ivan claimed 41 lives and caused $3.5 billion of damage when it moved ashore near Gulfport-Biloxi, Mississippi. Florida Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency in Florida after the hurricane came ashore and remained a hurricane for over a week as it moved up the state. The next year, Hurricane Charley's damage was estimated to be $28.5 billion after it struck North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida on August 13.

In 2004, Hurricane Dennis, after hitting the Texas coast as a Category 3, it stalled and came northward up the eastern seaboard of the United States. From the Carolinas all the way into the Delmarva Peninsula it flooded coastal areas. Hurricane Ivan moved up the East Coast in 2005, with $3 billion in damage in Florida. In 2006, Hurricane Ernesto caused $4.1 billion in damage as it moved up the East Coast, causing nearly $1 billion in damage in New York City. This Hurricane came close to hitting New York City with almost 100 mph winds with winds estimated to be at least tropical storm force.

In 2011, Tropical Storm Lee flooded areas along the mid-Atlantic and caused about $5 billion in damage in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. On the same year Hurricane Irene, hit New York City with 110 mph winds. It caused $15.8 billion in damage and it flooded various parts of the country.

Storms on the gulf coast
Storms off the Gulf Coast have always been an issue. The threat from hurricanes, especially from wind is very real. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew made landfall over the southern tip of Florida and ripped through Homestead, killing eight people and causing billions of dollars in damage. The 2000 hurricane season saw two significant storms: Hurricane Charley (which made landfall on the Florida panhandle) and Hurricane Ivan (which hit the Florida panhandle, the Bahamas, and near Georgia). The 2005 hurricane season saw two major hurricanes; Hurricane Dennis and Hurricane Katrina.

Storms between the Caribbean and the United States
The 2011 season for tropical cyclones was a near-normal season with slightly below average activity. The following is a list of notable tropical cyclones that impacted the North Atlantic basin from 2010–present.

Hurricane Earl: a small tropical cyclone, the storm hit the Bahamas and then Florida on the way north towards Massachusetts. The storm was considered unusual because of its track. A subtropical storm is typically much warmer than it is cold, while Earl was cold.
Hurricane Alex: moved northwest off of Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico, Alex then made landfall in the state of Veracruz as a Category 1 hurricane before moving into the Bay of Campeche. Hurricane Alex was unusual due to the timing of landfall (after the hurricane season has ended). Hurricane Alex killed 12 people.
Hurricane Sandy: hit New Jersey and New York City and caused around $75 billion in damage. It was the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, as measured by pressure. This was also the costliest Atlantic hurricane on record.
Hurricane Irma: a large Category 5 hurricane that made landfall near Marco Island in Florida. The storm passed north of Bermuda as a strong Category 4 hurricane. Irma killed 20 and injured around 30.
Hurricane Maria: took an unusual track between Bermuda and Puerto Rico. The storm was unusual in that it crossed into Bermuda before heading to Puerto Rico. It made landfall in southwest of Puerto Rico, then hit the northeast of the island. The remnants of Hurricane Maria reached Nova Scotia and later the United States East Coast, causing heavy rain across Canada and the Northeastern United States.
Hurricane Nicole: A very rare hurricane in that it followed an extremely unusual north-westerly track and then became the first hurricane to hit Grand Cayman in the Atlantic hurricane database's entire history.
Hurricane Ophelia: Made landfall on western Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane and moved across southern Florida.  This hurricane hit southwestern Florida at Category 2 strength, causing $1.9 billion in damage.
Hurricane Rina: Rina strengthened off the southern coast of the Dominican Republic, before moving north to strike Haiti as a powerful Category 4 hurricane. Rina was unusual due to the storm's weak winds and rapid movement towards Haiti.
Hurricane Iris: moved north across Florida, then entered the Atlantic, where it turned westward, passing to the north of Bermuda and made landfall in Ireland. This hurricane was unusual because it rapidly strengthened to Category 5 status. Iris killed two.
Hurricane Matthew: became a Category 5 hurricane with 120 mph winds near the Windward Islands of the Caribbean, becoming the first Category 5 hurricane to hit Haiti since 1964 and the first one to strike Florida since Hurricane Frances in 2004. Matthew caused one direct death and around $1.5 billion in damage.

Storms that originate over the Pacific Ocean

Tropical Storm Kiko passed just south of the Hawaiian Islands as a subtropical storm, before hitting Oahu as a tropical storm. It was unusual for a subtropical storm to hit the islands, but because of an increase in sea surface temperatures, Kiko reached hurricane-status in the open waters to the north.
Tropical Storm Norbert passed near Guam as a tropical storm, causing around $1 billion in damage.

Tropical cyclones that originated from the Atlantic Ocean

Tropical Storm Ana: caused over $6 billion in damage due to landslides and heavy rainfall in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Its remnants also caused heavy rainfall in the northeastern United States.
Tropical Storm Arlene: A tropical cyclone that killed two people in the island of Dominica and $50 million in damage when it moved through Dominica.
Tropical Storm Bret: moved quickly through the Caribbean islands and Florida, then entered the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into a tropical storm with winds of 65 mph. It continued to strengthen, becoming a hurricane, and hitting the Carolina coast at Category 1 strength, causing $40 million in damage.
Tropical Storm Cindy: moved north across The Bahamas and Florida, making a brief jog up the coast before hitting Louisiana as a strong tropical storm. It later weakened to a tropical depression over Ohio, then dissipated over Indiana and Ohio. The remnants caused severe flooding in the eastern United States.
Tropical Storm Debby moved across Florida, but caused massive flooding in Louisiana. Debby also caused two deaths due to drowning and flash flooding.
Tropical Storm Ernesto, and was the first storm to hit New York City since 2008. Ernesto killed one person and caused about $30 million in damage.
Tropical Storm Gordon: moved across the northeast corner of the United States, it was unexpected in that it hit the Cape Verde islands before moving up the northeast coast of Brazil. Gordon later turned north and weakened into a tropical depression.
Tropical Storm Ivan: One of the few hurricanes to have caused massive flooding along the east coast of the United States, Ivan is remembered for its extensive flooding in the Houston area. In 2004 the storm passed through New York City as a tropical storm and killed 13 people, it is the deadliest storm to have ever hit the area.
Tropical Storm Jerry: Jerry struck North Carolina and became a tropical depression before hitting Alabama and Georgia. Jerry was unusual because of the time of year that the storm hit the region, and the lack of storms that hit during a time when other storms often do.
Tropical Storm Lee: passed through the Leeward Islands, causing $25 million in damage.
Tropical Storm Lili: Passed through The Bahamas. Lili killed 1 person.
Tropical Storm Marco: a weak tropical storm that caused over $50 million in damage in Texas when it hit.
Tropical Storm Narda: hit Bermuda as a tropical storm. 
Tropical Storm Nestor: hit the Baja California Peninsula as a strong tropical storm. It later weakened to a tropical depression.
Tropical Storm Opal: A weak tropical storm that brushed the British Virgin Islands as a tropical storm. Opal produced heavy rains in northern Florida, causing over $1.5 million in damage.
Tropical Storm Rosa: hit the coast of Texas and Louisiana, killing five people.
Tropical Storm Rafael: the first hurricane to hit the Turks and Caicos Islands since records began. Rafael made landfall in Cuba as a strong Category 4 hurricane, after which it weakened into a Category 2 hurricane and later dissipated.
Tropical Storm Sebastien: Tropical Storm Sebastien made landfall in Louisiana as a tropical storm with winds of 40 mph. The storm caused around $100 million in damage.
Tropical Storm Tammy: hit Mexico and made landfall near the Texas border as a tropical storm, although its winds were lower than the other storms that week, Tammy was the strongest storm to hit Texas in five years.

Other notable events

A tropical storm moved across Bermuda from May 19–20, which is rare as only eight tropical storms have done so. However, this would be Tropical Storm Zeta's fourth, therefore this was its second time in this area.
In 2012, Hurricane Alex made landfall as</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:28
