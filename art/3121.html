After all the hype and anticipation, this was the question that many observers asked as Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20.

The stock market dropped on the news, while analysts pointed to the rising deficit, concerns about trade deals and looming fights with Congress. Yet Trump has yet to launch any large-scale initiatives with the government to show the effects of his campaign promises. This was a risk for Trump, but so far so good.

While Obama’s critics often suggested he was a liberal icon, Trump ran a campaign that spoke to many who felt ignored by Washington. He was a political outsider who promised to dismantle the status quo, all while calling on the public to “drain the swamp.” Despite the fact that he’s now the most powerful man in the world, Trump has yet to do anything that could ruffle his fellow citizens. This makes it hard to see a crisis, let alone a foreign threat. Even without the backing of a major military or major corporations, Trump can still use his Twitter account to keep the world up-to-date with his activities, which could be interpreted as a positive for the country.

On the home front, all is quiet. The new administration has thus far shown its softer side with the repeal of some regulations and the scaling back of others, as well as the promise of more to come. This has boosted morale of workers as well as investors. According to CNN, confidence among big business executives has “soared” as they applaud Trump’s efforts to roll back regulations and to “dismantle or scale back some of the business taxes.”

Amid the euphoria of the new administration’s early months, some supporters still point to the election of Trump as an answer to the ongoing failures of Washington. Trump can help the country when it comes to foreign policy, because it will allow him to sidestep the red tape of Congress.

After all, it’s no coincidence that the United States bombed Libya shortly after Obama had taken office, or that Obama sent troops to Iraq without consulting Congress. There are those who wish for Trump to end a war or an intervention like we saw under Obama. Trump is on track to do that.

It would be a mistake to overlook the potential for trouble, however. Most countries will continue to support their allies, even if it means disagreeing with the new administration. China has long warned that the TPP was a threat to its own interests, while many of America’s European allies have expressed concern over Trump’s anti-NATO and anti-EU rhetoric.

As much as he promised to fight global terrorism, there are those who worry that Trump will fail to address the ongoing threat of radical Islam. Obama took some small steps in this direction, while Trump has yet to deliver on his promises to tighten up immigration laws or put more pressure on Muslim countries to fight terrorism.

Trump’s plans for tax cuts and a smaller government will also give companies more power over workers, setting up the potential for labor strife and social unrest. It is hard to foresee why such changes could cause a rebellion, but some who did not vote for Trump or his predecessor find themselves on the opposing side of the struggle. In fact, Trump has yet to speak of any sort of new labor reforms, which means that any fight could be coming soon.

After a long political campaign, this is exactly what Trump wanted. The economy has slowed, with GDP growing at a rate of just 1.5% in the first quarter. The public is frustrated with Washington, and with the current state of the economy, many voters will agree with Trump’s election slogan: “Make America Great Again.”

There is good reason to doubt whether Trump can make America great again, but it is hard to imagine he won’t try, especially with an upcoming election and with many conservatives unhappy with his early proposals. While Trump may not be the answer, he is the most entertaining part of the political circus. For now, it is hard to look for a bigger disaster than Trump’s election, as there are some dangers here that are harder to predict. The potential for conflict comes not from radical Islam or an economic disaster, but from an unpopular new president who doesn’t like the status quo and who may not be a conservative in the way he likes to portray himself. A better analogy would be an unruly 5-year-old.

If Trump can keep his promises without hurting the nation, the backlash should be minimal. Yet it would be foolish to think that Democrats will roll over to avoid the conflict. If Trump can win the fight, all the better, but if he can’t, Republicans will find themselves playing defense.

As of now, Donald Trump has won the election — he has won the White House. With the inauguration, a shift in power in the world’s leading superpower is underway.

The U.S. government is still a constitutional republic, but it is no longer what it used to be. This inauguration was different. The White House’s Facebook page said it best: “We Are One People, United As One Nation.” It is hard to imagine a more honest description of America’s role in the world than that.

It may be a new day, but most people are still waking up to what just happened in their own lives. Most Americans were already looking toward the future. But if we now have an empire, where is America’s tomorrow?
