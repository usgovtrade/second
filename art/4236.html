The study is being conducted in two phases: an open label (OL) Phase I with 4-weeks treatment and a 3-month, double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) Phase II to examine the efficacy of lithium. After completing the OL Phase, patients who respond to 4 weeks lithium treatment are eligible to enter the DBPC Phase. This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a projected total sample size of 200 subjects. Outpatient volunteers with a history of chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) and a diagnosis of current nonpsychotic major depressive disorder are eligible for the study. Following a one-week, single-blind placebo lead-in, patients will be randomly assigned to lithium or placebo for a period of 6 months. Following the lithium lead-in period, patients who respond to lithium are eligible to enter the DBPC Phase. Safety, tolerability, and antidepressant efficacy will be assessed throughout the 6 months of the study. The final study analysis will examine the long-term effects of lithium (3 to 6 months post final treatment) and the DBPC Phase. The study has enrolled 33 subjects to date. The patients entered have a mean age of 40.3 years with a mean dose of 1728 mg/day. The mean HAM-D scores at entry were 24.4 with range from 17-34. These symptoms were successfully treated with the single blind lead-in period. During the follow-up period all subjects except one discontinued lithium as defined in the study protocol. No subjects experienced significant unwanted effects. Fourteen of 19 completed the study (with 3 dropping due to loss to follow up), and 9 were lost to follow up. This is in contrast to the 20 subjects (2 drop-outs) in the placebo group. Our results show that lithium can be used as a prophylactic agent in patients with chronic schizophrenia, as well as many patients with primary depression.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:13
