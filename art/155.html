point person to keep us all updated.  

If they'll be doing any shows, I'd like to attend that night with 
family members of mine.

I could definitely see Barrie stopping by for that week.

I'd also like to plan on Jeff attending with some members of his 
family during that week.

Just let me know

I can't wait to hear what Joe has in store.  

Take care

Marty, thank you for your note.  I, too, am very excited about the
opportunity to see what the Lone Star State is all about.  I hope to make
it over for one of your Redneck gatherings.  However, given my busy
schedule, don't know if I'll get there for the "shoot out" or the "tail
gate".  Those that attend the shoot out will have to excuse my tardiness.

Just let me know when you have those little get togethers.  Also, I'd love
to visit with you about your thoughts on how things are going at Enron
India and whether there is anything we can do from Houston to help
brighten  your day.  I visited with Sanjay a few weeks ago and he had
nothing but positive things to say about the way the business is
progressing.

While I am in Houston, I will also enjoy catching up with Kim, Gill, Roy,
Suresh, Bagwell, John and the other folks here.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

Cliff,

Thank you for your note - sounds as though you guys are busier than ever.

No commitments on the agenda at this time - though I understand a few
things are in motion.  We are trying to confirm a proposed date for the
Houston ISDA committee meeting and will let you know ASAP.  Also trying to
work out the agenda for the Energy & Developing Countries Conference so we
can get Mike back early.  The proposed dates for the European conference
are still on track.  Would you be available for dinner on Tuesday evening
March 21st?

Mike should be in town over the next couple of weeks as he prepares for his
"first" (he says) speaking engagement at the Academy.  We have agreed to
let him speak to the EES employee and trade groups in Houston on
Tuesday-Wednesday and to the ISDA employee group in NY on Thursday
afternoon. He is also giving a talk at a local venture capital institute
and will return to NY for one day at the end of the month for a recruiting
trip to Columbia. During his visits, he has proposed you meet with him for
an overview of Enron Online, followed by a more detailed discussion about
derivatives trading. I know you are extremely busy, so I will respect your
time but appreciate your willingness to spend a few moments with him.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Marty

Marty,

Just wanted to keep you in the loop re our Board presentation here at
Enron.  Please recall that the Board will meet on Wednesday, March 22,
8:30 to 9:00 a.m. here at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Houston.
You are the Chairman of the Governing Board, and I believe that it is your
pleasure to introduce all attendees (about 30) and run the meeting.  We
have submitted an agenda for your review which is also attached.  We would
like to begin the meeting at 8:15 a.m. allowing for the various
presentations and Q&A's.  I believe that this will give everyone an
opportunity to settle in their hotel rooms, have a continental breakfast,
and we will have completed preliminary discussions prior to meeting with
you at 8:30 a.m.  We will have the presentation materials with us and will
furnish a copy to you prior to the meeting.

Please let me know if there are any questions regarding the agenda. We
look forward to seeing you next week and receiving your thoughts and
comments.

Regards,

Cliff

Marty: 
I met with Bill Bradford, VP of Governing Board on February 8th to 
discuss 
Board level communications.  We agreed to put together a list of suggested 
messages 
and distribute for Board approval.  As we discussed, one of the major 
concerns 
expressed by the Governors is that they are not hearing from us.  Attached 
is 
the suggested agenda for the meeting, which includes an open mike for 
Governors.   
Please take a look and make any additions or deletions.  If the Board agrees 
with 
the suggested agenda, we can begin using it. 
Thanks 
Mark</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:12
