And speaking of love, in _The Big Fat Truth_ , you'll find twenty-five questions you can ask in a bar to test your lover's honesty. For example:

_"Does your wife look sexier to you when she's not around?"_

_"Have you ever had more than one wife at a time?"_

_"Do you have an agreement not to kiss her in the kitchen?"_

_"Can you think of anything sexier than a wet dress?"_

_"Are you in a position to get me an exclusive for the evening, or am I just another freebie?"_

_"Have you ever been unfaithful to me?"_

_"When you go home tonight, do you plan on going to sleep or going straight to the living room?"_

_"Do you want to go upstairs or out to dinner?"_

In addition, you'll learn the five secrets of the single man (he is not picky or unconfident, he does not always think before he speaks, he gets a rise out of you, he always takes the lead and he knows how to get ahead), the twelve keys to successful dating, and the thirty-eight most successful dating questions to ask a man, just in case you're struggling to ask any. So as well as all the dating tips and techniques, the fun part of this book is learning how to ask those thirty-eight questions to your potential new boyfriend, your new love interest, your new boss, or even to the guy you met in the beer garden last week who was so hot and bothered. Whatever your age, whatever your profession, whoever you're looking to impress, these questions will help you.

And just in case you can't seem to stop yourself from thinking about the future you, I've included another short booklet—also free!—called _The Big Fat Truth, Volume Two: Behavioural Clues and Other Red Flags for Dating Men_ , which reveals all the signals that indicate he's not right for you.

And if you're a man who's interested in trying to become the perfect date for the woman you're dating, or you're even just a little bit interested in trying to pick up women, then this book is for you as well!

You've seen a lot of magazines at the dentist's waiting room. You've seen a lot of articles in newspapers. You've seen some of them advertised in the air as you drive. Most of them are full of "useful tips" for women—because women are at the bottom of the pecking order when it comes to dating. We get the least amount of respect, and I think this is because it's not easy for men to talk to us without sounding like they're giving us a hard time, like they're judging us and not complimenting us. When men try to talk to us, we're very suspicious because we know they're probably trying to make a sale, and if we didn't have to buy something, we'd be far too embarrassed by the thought of men trying to sell to us.

But this book is not about dating tips. It's about something far more important. I've been on the air for eighteen years, dating five husbands, eight boyfriends, and one long-lasting fling. For twenty-one years, I've been a professional seductress, educating women in the art of dating and romance. For thirty-two years, I've been reading between the lines of your magazines, watching the television screen as you laugh at some idiot male who can't get a date, and wondering, "Why?"

This is the book I always wanted to write, the book I would've written if I'd been able to read it to you sooner.

So please, take my word for it. These tips will change your life. They will change the way you look at yourself, the way you look at the people in your life, and the way you look at the men out there who are just like you but who have the power to make your dreams come true. They will bring you closer to the man you always dreamed you would meet but were always afraid to approach. And as a bonus, they will open up a whole new world for you—the world of men who are completely obsessed with dating, men who know what they want and where to find it.

And if you want to know exactly how I found out this information in the first place, don't worry. I'm going to tell you all the little tricks and details I've learned along the way in case you ever get the opportunity to be invited for a second date with any of the guys I've mentioned, or if one of the guys ever reaches out to you and asks to meet you again.

I've also included a questionnaire at the back of this book that you can use to help you decide how to dress for your next date. There's a little section for men in case you ever want to go out with a man. In addition, I'm going to share some of my personal dating stories so you can see for yourself why it is, after almost fifty years in the industry, I'm so passionate about the subject. I know what it's like to pick up that man of your dreams, to keep a man with you for the rest of your life, and to have your dreams come true. I want to share it all with you so you can have the same experience.

I'm going to get right down to business. Here's what I want you to know.

Your confidence with men is the only thing standing between you and your happiness. How you see yourself and how you think about yourself are the only things that will keep you stuck in a place of unfulfilled hopes, a broken heart, or a dating life that isn't working out.

This book is your survival manual to help you reach for the stars. It's like having a little friend to keep you in check while helping you get to where you want to go, and more important, to how you want to look.

So let's jump right in. Let's get you ready for your first date!
[CHAPTER ONE  
HOW MEN THINK OF WOMEN](Bake_ISBN9780738712559_epub_c4_r1.html#Anch00063)

The first question I get when I appear on television is, "How can I find a man when so many men have an attitude problem and when women have such a difficult time finding Mr. Right?"

So I take all the information from every date I've ever been on, date every man who's ever shown interest in me, and I put it all together. And I know why most women can't get a date on their first try. But more important, I know why most women have trouble finding Mr. Right, even when they know who they're looking for.

You may never meet this man. You may never be single for more than five minutes after you meet him, but this man will help you through your life from the day you're born until the day you die. He'll be your most important teacher, your greatest source of happiness, and the most important man in your life.

This man will be your perfect man, your perfect match, your best friend, your lover, your husband, and the father of your children.

He's the man who's going to turn your dreams into reality. He'll be your savior.

Your Prince Charming.

He's your life's companion, your heart's desire, your perfect match, your perfect date, your love, your sweetheart, and the love of your life. And more important, he's a man who will change the course of your life. He is the man who will help you find a life partner, the man you want to grow old with, the man you want to have children with, the man you want to be happy with forever.

To be able to recognize when you're dating a man who's out to charm and impress you, or who wants to get close to you without really going all the way, you need to have a lot of knowledge on how men think. And as I've learned through the years of dating, it's easy to date a man who's really on the make. The first thing a man is going to do after he picks up the telephone and calls you is try to get you to give him your full attention. He'll give you every bit of attention that he can possibly give you in the time that you're together. He'll try to make every phone call, every e-mail, every text message count. He'll try to make every conversation memorable and special. He'll put effort into everything he does to try to get the message across that he wants to be special to you, and that he wants you to be special to him.

But no matter how special he's making himself to you, you've got to remember that men are very rarely ever being 100 percent sincere. They might be making things up about themselves to impress you, they might be trying to make themselves sound more interesting and unique than they are, or they may be desperately trying to get you to like him.

To put it bluntly, the man you're dating is probably telling you a little bit of the truth but lying about a lot more.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:06
