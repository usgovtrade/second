The Centre for Innovation and Technology (CIT) is set to reopen in the spring with more facilities for exhibitions, workshops and a new permanent gallery space.

The expansion, which is subject to funding, will allow the centre to become Scotland’s national science centre and will play host to a wide range of events.

The £3.9m expansion will take place over the next year and will also see the addition of a new public gallery space for people to learn about the science behind everyday items.

According to a council statement, the expansion will allow CIT to “reach out to and welcome more visitors and increase engagement with the local community”.

Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “This will be an invaluable asset to the city of Dundee and an inspirational space for all ages.

“Dundee is already home to the likes of Rampant Scallops, ScotDairy and the James Watt Centre. It’s vital we build on the work of these innovative companies and others and foster the city’s growing reputation as a hub for technology.”

The expansion will be an addition to the centre’s existing exhibits, including the Rampant Scallops, a display of the world’s largest collection of scallop shells which stretches over a metre wide, and the James Watt Centre for Science and Technology.

According to the council, the expansion will allow people to “discover scientific wonder” and give “visitors and passers-by a chance to learn and play in a vibrant and engaging space.”

Dr Stephen Gillespie, CEO of Dundee Science Centre Trust, said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for Dundee and Scotland to have the national science centre of the country.

“We are going to create an even more engaging experience for all ages.

“We believe that Dundee is the best place for a science centre. The facilities are second to none in the UK for STEM, or science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and it is in the hearts of the city. We have got the facilities, the people and the technology.

“The space that we will create will allow the science centre to reach out to and welcome more visitors and increase engagement with the local community. We will be able to provide more engagement with primary and secondary schools and show the children how science works.

“And, the events and activities that will be carried out will cater for everyone. Whether you are an experienced enthusiast or you’ve never been in a science centre, you will find a fun and friendly environment with something to suit everyone.”
