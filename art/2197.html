This was during the second verse, as this was the verse that everybody remembers, and it's not as though the lyrics were some long drawn-out rant of misery and despair. In fact, it's pretty funny. One could argue that the lyrics were actually the most hopeful thing ever uttered by a human being. After all, when did Woody Allen say, "I'm glad that it's almost over. I'm sure you are, too," or, "Why is it that one man in his lifetime reads more books than any other man in any other lifetime? And why is it that no one remembers his name? And yet his impact on his world is eternal." So, yeah, pretty funny.


When the song finally died at the tail end of the '70s, we thought that we'd never hear the line "The line will be drawn tonight" in anything but bad sci-fi movies.

"But it had to happen," you say. You may be right. We can all agree that this is a pretty neat song title that we use to describe many things we don't want to explain in the past tense. However, there is one point that no one can possibly deny, and it will never be refuted.


As an artist, Bob Dylan said some profound things about the world around him that can never, ever, be overstated. From "What's going on, man, don't you understand" to "I've grown accustomed to her face" and "I'll let you lick my peanut butter," Dylan has a wealth of lines that would be more than sufficient to justify the popularity of this album in anyone's mind.

The line that should be remembered, and always will be, is from that incredible second verse of "The Line Will Be Drawn Tonight": "This is my last phone call, I'm on the last train leaving town." That would be it for the last song of the album, which then began to fade to silence on the very next song, giving the listener time to think about what was just sung.




The next two songs were, respectively, "Not Dark Yet" and "Dirt Road Blues." The former, written and sung by Dylan, described the narrator's feelings on being unable to sleep, and how he is constantly exhausted and never sleeps for very long.


The line from "Dirt Road Blues," also by Dylan, that describes this narrator's relationship to God is just so incredibly sad. It's a perfect example of why this album is the best of all time.


Moving right along into the next song, "What Was It You Wanted," we get another one of Dylan's classics. I don't want to say too much about it, because I would hate for everyone to hear the song, and not be able to hear "The Line Will Be Drawn Tonight" when it comes up on shuffle, as it will inevitably happen, which is pretty damn funny.

What's even funnier is the way the song shifts midway through and switches from a sad, slow, dark, downbeat song to an upbeat and, frankly, absurd celebration of life. If I was to summarize the whole thing, it would go like this:

"I'm feeling down and out, lost and lonely,

And it's really starting to hurt.

I don't think I can make it through this year,

It's been a long year,

I know that it's my own fault, but I don't want to go through it another year,

I'll sit around for days, but I still don't know what to do,

I've got no home to go back to, I can't see no light at the end of the tunnel

But I know there is no other way to go

I'll never be free, until it's done,

It's just not for me, not for me.


I'm getting old, I'm not that young anymore,

I want to go home, I miss my children,

But I don't know how I can make it through another year,

It's been a long year,

I know that it's my own fault, but I don't want to go through it another year,

I'll sit around for days, but I still don't know what to do,

I've got no home to go back to, I can't see no light at the end of the tunnel

But I know there is no other way to go

I'll never be free, until it's done."


Okay, so it's funny that I have the song on shuffle when the lyrics turn from sad to happy, but I can't help myself. You just have to hear it for yourself, man.


The next song was, of course, "If Not for You." The song had already made it to number four on the charts in the UK by this point, and is considered by many to be the least interesting song on the album.

Sure, it has the famous line, "Well I don't know much / But I know what I like" and, also like the line from the previous song, it takes that line and extends it into a seemingly never-ending discussion of wanting to find love and wanting to just be able to hold a girl and maybe kissing her once.


But the song is a perfectly fine song for how it is structured. The first three verses basically describe the narrator's inability to stop thinking about the girl he desires, a girl who could be out of reach. I mean, the guy has her name, you know, and at one point, he can even name the street that he walks by in the morning before work.


The fourth verse though goes a bit off the rails. You see, the song's narrator is a pretty good guy. He's doing everything right. He's kind of just sitting around and waiting for love to come to him, and he even gets a girl to take a photo with him once. This, of course, leads to an epic "well, hell" moment.


The fact that the narrator of this song is such a nice guy really does take away a lot of the impact of the song. It's a bit of a letdown that it's the narrator's personality that makes this song less than as significant as the previous songs. However, once again, it's also extremely sad, as it describes the narrator's inability to let go of this girl and just date anyone else.


Next, we reach the song that, as I mentioned earlier, is also considered by many to be the least interesting on the album. It is, of course, "Got My Mind Made Up," and one can only imagine what lead to that title. Dylan was very interested in telling the stories of three people on this album, and he was not very interested in their stories being told through the eyes of a narrator.


First of all, you have the first verse. I always get asked about what this song is about, because it's so simple and straightforward that it's almost impossible to figure out.


It goes like this:

"Got my mind made up,

I ain't wasting no more time,

And ain't gonna be chasing no more rainbows,

Put my house in order"


Pretty awesome, right?

The problem with it, of course, was that Dylan was not going to make the listeners walk through those doors with him. He was just going to tell us about this guy with his house in order, and how he was not wasting any more time. In the second verse, he continues with the story of the guy whose mind is made up,

"Got my mind made up,

I ain't chasing no more rainbows,

Ain't gonna waste no more time,

Get things straight in my mind"


This is all interesting, but really none of it has anything to do with the guy whose mind is made up. He just wants to make sure he's going to be able to make it through the year before he breaks down and spends one more day doing something he doesn't want to do. "Ain't Gonna Wastin' No More Time" doesn't have any real sense of urgency behind it, and I think that's a major point of the song. It's Dylan singing about some issues that he's known about for years, and it doesn't sound particularly exciting or interesting. However, the second half of this song is very different, as the guy he's writing about gets a girl pregnant, and he knows that he'll have to pay a price for that.

The chorus repeats the "a" word, as in "ain't," "ain't gonna," and "gonna," once, twice, and then finally three times.


The line in the second verse that has always intrigued me is, "It woulda been alright, it woulda been alright, it woulda been alright," because it seemed like the narrator was waiting for a "yes," but it never came, so now the narrator can't handle it anymore and wants to leave. So, this could very well be the chorus. I don't know, but there is something fascinating to me about the song and the repetition of "ain't" as an important word in the song.


I love "Got My Mind Made Up." There was a time when I considered this to be</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:07
