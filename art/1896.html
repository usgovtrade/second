That leaves us with a thin bench even thinner after the fact.

That was the point he was coming over here to make yesterday. With the starting 5's length of service and performance, they need more time to gel before taking another step.

That was a terrible basketball play. I would love to have seen it for a few minutes as well and let it play out. I can tell you it wouldn't have ended like that, and as much as his teammates looked like they were a few steps behind, he could've made a good play with a few dribbles instead of getting into a position where he has to either get into the lane or shoot.

You keep saying that you want to see a few minutes of what happened so you would like to see it play out but you don't say what you want to see out of this game. You don't say whether you want to see them give him a dunk or even a layup since he missed both layups but you clearly want to see him be able to make his shot.

You want to play the game out with him make layup or dunk and to see if they still make up for missing the dunk. It doesn't appear to me that this has any benefit other than that.

I have been trying to figure out why people are against Curry and for Barnes. Let's face it, Curry won us a title and Barnes has been consistently mediocre and is overpaid. Barnes has been injured the last 2 seasons and has gotten worse on defense as he gets older. I have been surprised at the amount of people who actually like Barnes. I don't get it.

Erik's performance in that game was the catalyst for most of my dislike of the Warriors.

I was all for Barnes becoming a Warrior in 2009 when his rookie contract expired. He wasn't the #1 pick like Steph was, but he was clearly the best player on that 2010 Warriors team.

I just think that when you make one of the best players on your team less productive, it means that you as the coach aren't doing anything to utilize the skills he has and that's what has annoyed me about Phil Jackson and his teams. His players were either overpaid or overrated.

But when you make your #1 option a liability, that means the game plan has failed and it has failed a lot since Jackson became the coach.

The thing is, Barnes has been injured for most of his time in the NBA. How many players in the NBA have had a season where they have gone to the playoffs with that type of injury? It's not like the Warriors got him because they have an injury plan. He's got a history of injuries. Injuries will definitely take a toll on you. It's not something to take lightly. Barnes just got hammered by some bad luck this season. It's still ridiculous how much we've suffered from injuries to this team. We have been playing without our top point guard, our best defender and most of our backup point guard. That's a lot to work through.

It wasn't just Barnes that was hurt, we also lost Bogut for a portion of the season and Curry played without feeling well, Curry at times. So, for the season, we have had to deal with the loss of our franchise player and the injury of two others who are important pieces of our team.

While Jackson seems to just blame injuries, I am not willing to accept that and when I can't rely on Barnes to produce at least what he did last season (which was not much), I am wondering what's going to happen in the playoffs when things start getting serious.

No, Barnes has not played enough at SF to know if he will ever be a consistent scoring threat, but he is a perfect fit for bench unit. While Barnes and Iggy make for an unassuming starting 5 they really are well rounded players who fit into most lineups. The biggest concern is Barnes inconsistent 3pt shooting, which I think he can improve, and if he continues to play defense like he has of late we really won't need another SF.

He may be a bit undersized but I do like his ball handling and shot.

I was fine with Barnes until the last few games when he seemed more concerned with scoring than he is on team defense.

His 3-point shooting is his biggest weakness. He may have a decent touch around the rim but his jumper is just not good enough for him to be a major contributor at SF.

I'm not saying Barnes is a bad guy or a bad person, he is basically the opposite, but with the rest of the roster I have some doubts if he can be the main contributor on any title run.

If I was a GM and this guy was about to make $10 million, I would take my chance on a young star PG and sign him to an affordable contract. A guy like DeAndre Jordan who is still unsigned is going to get paid. We have a small window with Bogut here to win a title. If Bogut continues to heal, we can sign another vet PG or a young guy like Lance Stephenson who is playing well now.

The guy is just not worth the money he is getting paid. He is worth far less to the team and he has missed almost all of the last two seasons with various injuries.

But as a fan, we are the ones who pay his salary, so we will continue to support Barnes, and all players, no matter what we think of them as people. Barnes just got injured, but some would argue Barnes doesn't play with that much heart. However, his game is on and off. Hopefully, the injuries will not continue as they did the last season. If he gets hurt again, I hope it's not in the playoffs because of all the pressure that will be on him.

You keep saying that you want to see a few minutes of what happened so you would like to see it play out but you don't say what you want to see out of this game. You don't say whether you want to see them give him a dunk or even a layup since he missed both layups but you clearly want to see him be able to make his shot.

Not even then. My biggest gripe with Barnes has been his inability to be an effective wing defender in isolation or from behind the arc. He's always had the ability to defend one on one in the mid-post and at the rim but he has not been good on the perimeter with his man posting up and guarding him in space or when their man goes off of him in help defense. To me that weakness makes Barnes a bad fit for this type of system. There will come a point where Barnes has to step out and shoot or he is going to be a liability for this team. I don't think he can play in the mid post like he did during the playoffs and the last two years for this team because those are the things where he will get benched by Casey.

it is always an issue that goes deeper with Curry and it is not something he can overcome with individual effort.

He plays his best in the playoffs but at this point he is just a player that cannot be relied on at all in the regular season.

There's a difference between Barnes' skills and how they are utilized and Barnes and not playing well. Barnes is better than he shows. He is a much better, more reliable offensive player than Amir, and he has the skills for the point forward position,</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:40
