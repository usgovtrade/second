Data Processing System, DPS, is an integrated, end-to-end solution for developing, deploying and managing intelligent business services across any infrastructure or device and across any organization. DPS transforms a business into a trusted advisor for digital initiatives through the integration of unparalleled industry expertise and domain-specific, user-friendly visual development tools into a single agile data center platform. DPS empowers the creation of user-centric applications by empowering business users to quickly and easily develop the applications to solve their business problems, reducing the time from problem formulation to solution. DPS makes it easy to: create new interactive business services and business applications quickly using familiar modeling languages and business rules; integrate and extend services with other applications using web services; transform the resulting business service into any form for deployment on a variety of devices; provide secure access and privacy controls to enable access and operation of user-focused data in the cloud and on any device; deliver business services and applications to users on any device using a native user experience that provides the user with seamless transitions between connected devices and a familiar user interface; and manage, deploy, monitor and troubleshoot applications in the cloud and on any device.
Enterprise Cloud Management for Digital Business, ECOMDB, is a web-based, extensible platform for secure and reliable delivery of dynamic and intelligent business services for enabling digital transformation of enterprises. ECOMDB enables the creation, delivery and management of application-based services for all users in real-time while providing secure access to those services using multiple access points such as a web browser, mobile devices, native applications, and even an interactive voice response system. ECOMDB also provides a rich set of administrative tools for building and deploying and managing application-based business services in a unified way across multiple delivery points using a common core. Using ECOMDB, the user can deploy, configure and administer their business services in real-time with zero configuration and zero management interfaces. The application can be installed and configured remotely from a central location, allowing multiple end users to access the same set of business services, without the need for extensive training.
The aforementioned, related art fails to provide an effective solution to the problem of creating highly secure data processing systems. Moreover, the existing approaches fail to adequately address the creation and administration of data processing systems in a unified way. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved method and system for creating highly secure data processing systems. There is also a need for an improved method and system for creating and administering data processing systems in a unified way.
In accordance with the object of the present invention there is an improved method and system for creating highly secure data processing systems that eliminates or substantially reduces disadvantages or problems associated with previous systems and methods.
The system of the present invention provides an effective, unified solution to the problems associated with the creation and administration of data processing systems in a highly secure manner. The present invention provides a unified model for developing data processing systems in a uniform and streamlined way without creating a redundant code base. The unified solution also enables the creation and administration of data processing systems in a uniform and streamlined way without creating a redundant code base.
The data processing system includes one or more resources, one or more security features and one or more security policy. Each resource is assigned to a role and each role has a series of defined permissions. The data processing system employs a uniform communication platform to allow inter-resource, inter-role, inter-policy communication and interaction. The inter-resource communication is based on a common</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:17
