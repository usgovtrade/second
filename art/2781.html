These songs were written in 1985 and 1986. They began recording those songs with producers George Tobin and Bob Rock.

Production 
The album was produced by George Tobin, who was known for producing albums by many artists such as: Aerosmith, Kiss, Queen, and Whitesnake. These eight songs were written by David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. Most of the songs featured both musicians who were sharing lead vocals. Also the songs were performed with the backing vocals by Jon Anderson, who was the lead singer of the progressive rock band Yes. These eight songs were performed live at the concerts from 1987 to 1991.

Jon Anderson was approached to sing on this album because this album's producer, George Tobin, had produced two Yes albums and wanted to release some material with Yes-like harmonies on it.

Music journalist Phil Sutcliffe commented that the music was like "a musical tribute to the 1970s".

Release 
The album was released on July 8, 1988. In the UK, the album peaked at number 33 on the British album chart. In the US, the album charted at number 71 on the Billboard 200 album chart, and number 39 on the Billboard Rock Albums chart. It is the last album of both singers, as they disbanded in the following year.

The band also released a single "Into the Fire" and "I'm the One", featuring a music video directed by James Shearman and filmed in a Hollywood soundstage. Both singles failed to chart.

In 2006, the album was released on a special edition with an expanded liner notes and other additional tracks. The bonus tracks were "Lovechild", "I Believe" (the second single of the album), and "The Ballad of John and Yoko" as a single or in live performances by David Coverdale. In 2009, it was released on the compilation album The Early Years, which features the best of both Whitesnake and Deep Purple.

Critical reception

AllMusic's brief review said: "A solid offering from Whitesnake is this, David Coverdale's first stab at solo work. The lineup is quite solid, especially on songs like "Dancing on the Edge of the Razor," "Laying Down the Law," and "In and Out of Love." Though "Dancing on the Edge of the Razor" is the most immediate, there are also good cuts from this album, "I'm the One" and "Lovechild" being two of them." In 2017, Sputnikmusic staff highlighted this album as one of the best blues-rock albums of all time.
