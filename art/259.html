If graphene didn't take off, the technology would still be a success.

There was a BBC article today about a material called Buckyballs. Rather than
laying graphene "layer upon layer", these are the carbon atoms _arranged_ in a
similar shape to graphene, not _laying_ on top of each other like graphene.
They're about 5 atoms thick and are currently quite expensive to make. Also
they don't really have a use, just curiosity value.

They're not exactly the same. They have similar characteristics, but it's not
100% clear that they're going to be as usable as graphene.

Just got a "You can't add products to your cart at this time" error. Anyone
else?

I am getting it as well.

I figured it was some kind of karma / error. But it persists.

~~~
littletimmy
I doubt they are being spammed so badly that a permanent error would be caused
by some random action. Perhaps there is some technical problem?

~~~
tocomment
So it has happened consistently for about an hour or two. So it must be a
technical problem. I wonder what they could be fixing.

i was a big fan of graphene when it was discovered, now that it has been
discovered to be a less exciting material (no more miraculous uses for it) I'm
disappointed in graphene as a wonder material.

i hope there's enough of a market to push graphene research forward and find
useful things to do with it.

It still has great potential in nanotechnology. A year ago I read a great
article about it from Popular Science [1] that made me curious about the
nanotechnology side of the field.

thank you for this article, the page loaded quick.

This is interesting - here's the video from the Royal Society announcing the
paper:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGc7FZ7PzF8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGc7FZ7PzF8)

(not sure what the title is - it's not "Founding Father of Graphene Dies at
93"...)

~~~

I don't know if he was involved with graphene or not (and can't find the
article about it online). In some places he refers to graphene as "graphitic
crystals" which the article seems to use to describe the material's actual
structure. Graphitic crystals are a common form of carbon-based fuel.

He wasn't, but he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work with graphene:

It has been hard to know what to with graphene other than that it cannot be
used for its primary purpose. Now that graphene's been a dud its time to find
the next wonder material and hopefully that one will also turn out to be a dud
and that too will become another great milestone in tech history.

Weird to have "founding father of graphene dies at 93" as the HN headline,
when the first post here today at Hacker News from the journal Nature[1]
reports an obituary, not a discovery of a new material.

This is not a new material at all -- the article is about graphene as well as
its applications. See
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphitic_crystal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphitic_crystal)
and
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene)

Thanks for linking those, looks like they're being used extensively in the
paper in question.

I had no idea graphene was used as a paper product. I was going to suggest it
as a high-tech paper substitute but now that I know it's used in a very
different market, it seems that maybe it shouldn't have a different name.

Great, now the internet is going to turn to carbon ? They've found a way to
make graphene, which is great. But now let's talk about _how_ graphene
manufacture was discovered, instead of the discovery itself ? Great
continuation of this meme, everyone should stop and think about how science is
a process, and not a destination.

P.s. this is HN, this is why we can't have nice things

The first discovery is a "new material", graphene is just an example of the
material.

~~~

You could say graphene is the first and greatest material of the new age of
manufacturing ?

A news article with a picture of graphene? How did we get on HN?

Interesting that the name 'graphene' was found by Professor S. Geim and Dr.
Kostya Novoselov at Manchester University.

Great article is here:

I don't understand the point of this criticism. Do you think geim and
novoselov would not have found graphene if not for the article?

~~~
anonymfus
They are simply being sarcastic. I wanted to provide another source and I did
it. Maybe it would be a good practice to mention such sources on similar
topics in comments.

~~~
hackcasual
I don't know what you mean by sarcastic. Yes, I agree if you mention another
source in the comments you should do that.
