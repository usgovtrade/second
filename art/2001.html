“The ‘Million Dollar Mistake’ is a phrase that became popular in 2008-2010 and a million-dollar mistake refers to an expense of $1,000,000 or more that could have been avoided.”



“I think this concept is something to be aware of because it’s something that can happen to all of us.”

If you have a small business, you might want to check your own expenses to make sure you’re not overlooking anything that’s costing you thousands of dollars.

“You can’t save money if you can’t find it.” – Tonya Reiman

In today’s world, we’re exposed to information faster than we ever have been. You can’t just “live your life” and hope you’ll be okay in retirement or in other areas of your life. You have to plan and work for the future. That means saving money and reducing expenses.

“I think it’s important to get clear on what a ‘small’ business is. Small businesses often find themselves behind the times as compared to big companies. If you’re still using a typewriter or fax machine, it’s time to consider an upgrade. Technology is always advancing and if you find yourself wanting, or thinking about wanting, a major expense like that, put it on the back burner until you have the money to spare. Because you never know when something will go out of business or just plain shut down. It could happen to you any day.”

Saving and investing for the future is essential. Many people aren’t sure how to do it. They don’t realize how many expenses they have. That’s where retirement calculator apps come in handy. They can help you see your expenses in a whole new way.

“As far as your questions for me go, I think it’s great that you would ask about a retirement calculator. While it’s still not my specialty, I can share some of my personal knowledge with you about investing and how they’ve been designed to help individuals. I have always relied on my personal life for my own experiences and observations to inform my understanding of investing and it’s always worked out quite well.

“Retirement calculators as far as I know are something that really became popular in the 60’s and 70’s and they were used as a tool by financial advisers. It was a way to help them assist clients in planning for retirement. In short, a retirement calculator will take the information that you provide and calculate a number of variables with regard to how you might fare in retirement and you might see numbers like that one example that you gave me which was around $30,000 per year. So that would be your ‘comfort level.’ A key idea here is that you really want to assess your ability to withstand some sort of disruption in your ability to make an income and if that’s your plan, it’s critical to do that.”

We’ve had some great discussions about living expenses and how they affect retirement. You can probably work a few of these ideas into your own personal planning.
