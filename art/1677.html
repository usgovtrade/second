This coffee is an acquired taste, not sure I'm for it. I've been drinking it for two months and I still find it odd...

The whole thing about the coffee thing has been nothing but a bad experience.

The most ridiculous part of this is the fact that they offer the same coffee at their drive thru's, at one of their local stores. There was an employee who was pouring it into cups behind the glass. When I told her that I did not like the coffee and was not going to buy any more she stated that the store manager made her come over to me and apologize. She actually cried and asked me to come back so that they could make things right. I'm sorry but I don't appreciate a company that doesn't want my business even if they want my business they should never try to manipulate anyone into buying their product. I would like to meet the store manager, personally if that is even possible. Anyway I called them back a few days later and spoke to a manger. He told me to come in and we'll make things right. He came into the store that I went to and introduced himself. He gave me a free container of free coffee. He then said that they don't usually do that. If it were his decision he would have fired her on the spot. That's how much I did not like the coffee. There were a couple of employees there who actually served me coffee and everyone else who was there were either managers or higher up.

I was going to order some Starbucks and I was worried about the milk/lactic acid. But now that I read your post I'm glad I didn't order any. I can't imagine trying to drink this stuff at the same time I'm trying to eat with the kids.

What a great story! Well, actually a bad story but what the heck. I have never had a product fail me so quick and so completely. I'll never drink Starbucks again either. I've just about thrown up whenever I smelled the coffee, or worse, seen it (in one of the many coffee shops that my hubby insists that we go to). I was in Starbucks last night and couldn't take it, so we went home and did some work instead.

I think if I was that manager I would have sent the manager from the drive thru over to talk to you. When she tried to apologize to you and you told her you don't like coffee... she probably took it more personally than you might think. You would think that if you don't like it then just leave, but it was more like she wanted to make you like it. It's really the people who can't stand the heat, that get burned. I have had the same experience. I don't like coffee, but I love Starbuck's coffee, because the employees are kind and patient. I had a very sweet girl working there who gave me a free coffee and I wasn't even ordering a drink. She just wanted to do something nice for me. But when I tell people in real life, no they didn't give me a free cup of coffee...they didn't think I was being serious. And that's when it gets funny. They try to use you to get free coffee.

I will not go to Starbucks, but I am tempted. I will wait until it goes to discount (they have sale right now) then I'll go for a cup. My friend ordered a large one, she's the one who got the free cup of coffee.

It's a bad company for starters! You have to pay for overpriced coffee with your own money. But that is just my opinion. I am not rich but I don't go there. But some people will do anything to get that freebie!

I just came back from my visit to starbucks after I've read about it... The employees were nice and so were their coffee.... i didn't order anything but a coffee because I'm not a fan of coffee (I really hate drinking hot drinks in the summertime) but since I have to stay there longer, I did order the drink they had as you could only pay thru the computer. They also have that iced mocha drinks. Their drinks were tasty....and it was my first time ordering anything from starbucks....

But I'm getting the chills thinking about it...

Starbucks is definitely a good place to get your caffeine, and a few of my co-workers go there all the time. The coffee is fine, and even though I don't particularly like their atmosphere, it is a great option for someone looking for a place with an atmosphere to unwind.

I just hate to think of how many tons of coffee waste they produce with all of that coffee drinkers. I know there is a lot of plastic waste, and also paper waste... but what really concerns me is the pollution caused by this many people ordering something from coffee... pollution that will affect everyone on earth, especially the poor people and people in other countries..
