Sara and her family moved to Stamford in 1999. A New England native, she’s always had a fascination with the area and, even more so, with the history of Stamford. She has been a history buff since her days at Stamford High School. During her junior year, Sara was the student who gave the history presentations. She was chosen for the job because she was able to tell the story with passion and humor and was not afraid to pull from the more grisly sections of history. Sara and her dad would often visit cemeteries in the dead of winter, reading the funerals’ epitaphs and doing some research of their own. Sara has been reading gravestones and chronicling history long before these blog entries. It was in 2005 when she decided that the entire family should record the time, events, and people of our community and country. Sara is an advocate of government transparency. Sara has been active with the Citizen’s Band Radio Service (CB Radio) since she was fourteen. She’s interested in recording the history of the community in a unique fashion. Her radio show, The No-Raisen Hour with Sarah No-Raisen can be heard on Wednesdays at 6:20 a.m. on WDST (1480). You can contact Sara at No-Raisen@gmail.com or (203) 933-2568.
