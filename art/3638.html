The video starts off with a shot of a giant storm cloud and then cuts to an old school phone booth, presumably in an apartment building, and then to a street where a man is looking around suspiciously. The camera then zooms into a window that shows several young men eating, and then the camera zooms further into a window where one man is peeing. The scene cuts back to the man outside the phone booth, and then quickly changes to show a shot of him watching a news report about a hurricane, causing him to turn around and walk away. The camera then quickly changes back to the man in the room with the phone booth and shows him staring at the window, clearly disturbed.

A woman in a bikini is seen walking towards him. He turns and walks away as she is seen walking away, revealing her to be wearing a full body swimsuit and wading through water.

It then changes again to a man standing on the side of the road, watching the storm and the woman walking away. As the woman gets closer to him, she walks down to the storm's edge, peeing on it. He then gets angry, and looks up at the sky, where a huge dark cloud and bright light appear as loud thunder rumbles throughout the area. As the camera zooms in, the two men are seen staring at the clouds from afar. The next scene shows a shot of two policemen, a man with dreadlocks, and a woman in a large bikini walking away from the man with the dreadlocks. The scene zooms in on the face of the woman as she walks, and then zooms out to show her butt. The scene then shows the man with the dreadlocks and the cop walking away, and a young man is seen standing on the street corner staring at them as he is seen getting hit on the head by a baseball bat. The last scene shows him on the ground, presumably dead, as the camera zooms into a police officer standing over him. The movie ends with the line, "It's the end of the world as we know it. And I feel fine."
