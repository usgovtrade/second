This is the second book in the Underwater Life series, and it is probably my favorite so far. Richard Ellis continues to tell an incredible story about a world that is so unfamiliar to me (i’m more of a land-based kind of person) and fills me with such wonder. The novel opens in the middle of a story that we’ve seen hints of, and we get to see all the threads that you were promised, slowly unravel.

I love that Ellis does more with the underwater life than simply showing us the world below the sea. He goes as far as allowing us to meet some species, and shows us more details of their habitat. He shows the reader more than what is possible by using the perspective of the narrator to tell the story. We are taken on a wonderful ride as the story progresses from one mystery to another, leaving you guessing at the plot twists and turns before they happen.

I love his writing style. There are very few books written that have the same effect on me as this series has on me. I can’t wait to read the final book.

It’s an understatement to say that this is the most epic underwater trilogy I’ve ever read, but in this stunning follow-up to The Blue I am not sure I can put a new label on it. The story opens with the mysterious disappearance of two submarines in a remote part of the ocean. And yes, our narrator who has a keen sense of being lost in life, is back for book 3. We are treated to the history of the submarines and the background story of life below the waves. Ellis’ ability to create an underworld setting as rich as any we’ve seen before has been phenomenal. If you’ve been wanting more and you don’t read the first two books in the series, don’t skip this entry. While the first book was mostly a love story, this one will entertain you whether you love submarine stories or are completely new to the genre.

This trilogy should be required reading for every kid who dreams of being a submariner! While the underwater world itself is not as developed as Ellis’s other books, this trilogy as a whole is a magnificent, must-read experience. You have characters dealing with issues of faith, family, relationships, responsibility, and loss, all while being trapped in an alien world so beautifully created.

The second book of the Underwater trilogy is a fantastic continuation of the story told in The Blue. Ellis captures the wonder and wonder of the ocean with beautiful prose and fascinating details. It is a must-read for every sailor.

There are many undersea creatures described in this book, and I loved the thought process and scientific detail that went into them. It is a rich world of life below the waves that is very easy to get lost in. It is also a story full of deep emotion. Ellis has done a great job developing the characters, as they go through their development of their abilities. This was a fun adventure.

Well I’m definitely a Sci Fi reader, so this is right up my alley. I did feel I had to be on the edge of my seat all the way through. Some of it I had a tough time believing, yet when did the next surprise comes that turns the tale to reality. If you like tales of the realms of imagination and reality intertwined you will have your hands full this evening. The story just kept rolling along, no matter what I thought. Well done Mr. Ellis and crew. Well done.

The Ocean’s Surprise is a great follow-up to The Blue, the first in Richard Ellis’ trilogy about life on and under the sea. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and found it really interesting from the character development to the intricate descriptions of the various lifeforms and environments on and under the ocean. This book stands on its own but I felt that The Blue is definitely a must read if you’ve read the first book. This series was very good and so I look forward to the conclusion to The Ocean’s Surprise.

When I picked up The Blue, I didn’t know what to expect. I ended up being surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The second book in the series, The Ocean’s Surprise was right up my alley, and kept me on my toes through the entire story. Ellis has written a vivid picture of the ocean and the people living in the sub-lives below the surface, and I highly recommend this series.
