"It's My Night" was also issued in the UK as a single and failed to chart, while a version recorded by The Delfonics reached the US R&B charts.  It has since become regarded as one of James' signature songs and has been described as one of his greatest recordings.  Author Sylvia Robinson refers to it as "the definitive James 'Dandy' song" and describes the song as "perfect".

Song information
"It's My Night" was recorded in 1966 and released as the B-side of "Be My Baby".  "It's My Night" has become one of James' signature songs, and has been described as one of his greatest recordings.  Author Sylvia Robinson refers to it as "the definitive James 'Dandy' song" and describes it as "perfect".  Producer Willie Mitchell wrote that the Delfonics, who released their version of the song later in the year, "could have had a smash hit with it if it was given to them", although other writers claim that it was the Rolling Stones who inspired the song.

Writing and recording
The song was written and produced by Stax songwriter and producer Willie Mitchell and is one of several soul songs written by Mitchell. Like many other Stax songs, it was recorded by the Mar-Keys, although it was never released by them on record. The Mar-Keys were an R&B group formed at Memphis' Sun Records label in 1964 by Otis Redding, Steve Cropper and Joe Morgan, who were later joined by Wayne Jackson. They recorded their debut session at Stax and then left for Atlantic Records after Redding was denied permission to record a group composition. The recording of "It's My Night" became their last recording session. The song was later included in the re-issue of their first album, Mar-Keys '65.

Release and aftermath
Following the recording of "It's My Night", Otis Redding left for Los Angeles, where he signed a deal with Mercury Records. Before leaving, he recorded "A Change Gonna Come", a song which was originally written as a ballad. Redding's version was re-recorded with funkier music and dance-style rhythms which became one of his signature songs. When Redding left for California, James Williams took over his position as lead singer of the Mar-Keys and began his tenure as Stax's primary vocalist. Redding's "A Change Gonna Come" made the top 10 of the US Billboard R&B chart in 1966 and became a popular cover by black artists.

The Mar-Keys' version of "It's My Night" was released on the re-issued version of Mar-Keys '65, issued in 1966. It was also issued in UK as a single in the same year, backed with "Go-Go, Tell Aunt Rhody" on Stax UK. This version, issued as Stax 1493, failed to chart. Stax began to struggle after losing Redding and their other artists. 
The Delfonics recorded the song for their 1967 album, The Delfonics Present a Soulful Tribute to Mar-Keys. "It's My Night" was re-issued in November 1967, and the Delfonics' version made the UK charts. This version also reached #13 in the US R&B chart and #45 in the US pop chart.

In 1972, John Lennon covered the song as a duet with Yoko Ono on his album Some Time in New York City. Ono also covered the song in her live concert at the 1971 Vancouver Pop Festival in which Lennon attended.

Covers
"It's My Night" was covered by Bill Bartee and the Bocci Band.  They had a US Billboard R&B #11 hit in 1974, and again when the track was re-issued in 1995. In a review for JazzTimes, critic Dan McClenaghan wrote: "Bartee and the Bocci Band prove they’re as sharp a pair as we’ve heard in years." 

"It's My Night" was covered by the UK band Madness for their 1979 album Seven. Madness' version was produced by Steve Lillywhite and Steve Sanger. The song peaked at #3 in the UK charts.

In 1984, the song was covered by the post-punk band The Sisters of Mercy for the soundtrack of the film Vision Quest, including its sequel, Beyond the Vision Quest, as well as their cover version of "Ain't it Strange", also featured on their Vision Quest album.

An electronic remix version of the song appears on the 1997 Soul Coughing album Let It Be Known.

The song was also covered by Norwegian electronic musician and producer Ulver, appearing on their 2008 album Skittish.

This song was also covered by the British new wave band Heaven 17.
