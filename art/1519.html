I had a blast performing. It's always so nice to hear that an artist appreciates your work. Thank you Jody and the fans at the club for making my night!

You can check out the performance video on the next page. Enjoy!

We did do one thing that I haven't done before: A special acoustic performance with just the song "I Will Destroy You." This song was used as the entrance theme to the video game NHL 09 which features the New York Islanders. (Yes, you read that correctly. A hockey game was part of my entrance song.)

It was a different experience being an audience and listening rather than performing.

Thanks to Jody and her team for letting us do this and for helping me promote my music.

My buddy Tia Ray did a guest vocal performance on a special acoustic version of my song "Falling Leaves" with David Brooke of The Shins.

Tia gave me my first introduction to the "Boombox," a device that is used as an amp. This was my very first experience with a Boombox. I did take a pic of the gear, but it's hard to see my friend with the giant headphones on.

I actually purchased a new "turntable" after this gig. It's a great addition for any budding DJs, I recommend it. You can have fun with your home entertainment set-up like Jody did, I think it's really cool.

A couple of months later I got to take the stage to perform for another group of people. I was honored to be invited backstage to take a photo with Chris Brokaw of the band "The Shins."

It was a fun experience having a few minutes to chill with the guys from the band and talk music and life. I was excited to have met them because Chris has the number 1 song in the country "The Greatest."

I'm so thrilled for Chris because he is very talented. I'll be checking out The Shins "Campfire Songs" when it comes out. They are just plain awesome.

I want to thank you for coming to my shows! This was my third time performing for the Long Island City crew, and it was just as awesome as the previous two times. We had some great people at the gig including the super talented Tia Ray and her friend Dave.

This was my first time performing at "The S.O.B.'s." I had no idea that there were so many people here tonight for me, a small group of family and a few friends. I was nervous about performing in front of such a large group of people. I'll have to work on that because it makes for a better show when you can really connect with the audience. Thanks again for coming out to the show and supporting my music.

A friend of mine took a video of one of the live acoustic performances at Joe's Pub in New York. I had the opportunity to take the stage and play one of my original songs "Falling Leaves" with another amazing musician, Tia Ray. The song was on NHL 09, a video game that I did the theme song for.

We are both playing at a special game release event at Joe's Pub. The event will be from 6:00 - 8:00 pm on Tuesday, May 22, 2012. We will be performing 3 songs for the game. We will have a special performance at 6:30 for fans and players, an additional acoustic set from 6:45 - 7:00.

You can purchase the video game on Amazon by clicking the link below. Also, check out my EP entitled "I Will Destroy You."

It was the first time for me to play at The S.O.B.'s, a new club on Long Island City, New York, which is pretty awesome. I was honored to play this private event for one of my long time friends, Gary Vaynerchuk, the entrepreneur, investor, internet superstar and host of The #AskGaryVee Show on the VaynerMedia network, on Vaynermedia.com.

I was joined by the amazing drummer Brian Chait who lives in Connecticut. If you ever get a chance to see Brian play you should check him out.

Thanks for supporting my music, check out my album "I Will Destroy You."

I really like the album cover for I Will Destroy You. My manager at the time had me dress up in a suit with a white t-shirt and sunglasses. I thought it was a great way to represent my rock and roll sound but not to lose the originality of my sound.

Here's a behind the scenes video of me recording the song "I Will Destroy You" from my album "I Will Destroy You."

I was proud to perform in this showcase at Webster Hall, located on the bottom floor of the former Loews theater. The show was sold out and it was a very special experience to perform in front of an audience that was expecting a great show. My musical friend Jody Gerson gave me my first introduction to a Boombox which was interesting to see for someone like me who is still getting used to the device. I just wanted to get more from the song "Soul Destroyer" than just the studio version, a big challenge for me. But it was a big success and the crowd went crazy.

I'm thrilled to be playing "Gamer's Night at E3" and working with the fine people at ASTRO Gaming. The game will be at E3 starting June 10th and I'll be performing at their live event on June 9th as well.

ASTRO Gaming is doing a ton of cool things and having my artwork on their line of accessories is awesome!

I'm looking forward to being part of the special Gamer's Night at E3, which will kick off the week-long annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, the world’s leading trade show for computer and video games, for the very first time ever. Gamer’s Night will be held at Westgate City Center in Los Angeles on June 9. The live performance will be an exclusive one-night-only event.

"Gamer's Night" is a special charity event where gamers can hang out, play games, win prizes, make friends and have a great time all for a good cause. This will be a very special way for me to kick off my Summer Tour that will take me across the United States. I'll also be doing a big show in Houston later on this year. The "Gamer's Night" logo is all over my Tour shirt and will be featured on other merchandise as well.

Check out my newest music video "Falling Leaves" which is featured in the soundtrack for NHL 09. The video is directed by Scott Sossamon and edited by Daniel Sossamon. I'm so excited to be part of this project that was developed by EA's RedOctane division that helps with licensing in the video game industry.

Here is the video of me and director Scott Sossamon talking about the footage for my second music video "Falling Leaves."

The video was shot by James Wright at his house in Connecticut. Wright is also featured in the video along with The Shins's Chris Brokaw who plays the character "Sam" in the song. It was very cool to finally meet Chris, I have admired his work and his music for quite some time.

I have a new video coming out soon, "Falling Leaves" from my new album</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:05
