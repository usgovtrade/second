There are a number of surgical techniques for implanting lenses in eyes that have become cataracted or which have developed other conditions that interfere with the natural lens. Such surgical techniques include phacoemulsification (cleavage), lensectomy (intracapsular or extracapsular), anterior or posterior sub-capsular intra-ocular lens insertion, and secondary lens implant following failed cataract removal or secondary implant following failed laser treatment. It is known that after such surgery, both a clear, visual impression of the implant and close proximity of the implant to the target tissue is important in attaining high implant success rates.
When preparing the eye for cataract surgery, many surgeons use a capsular tension ring to stabilize the capsulorhexis. There are also a number of secondary procedures that have been used in an attempt to secure an intraocular lens in position after it has been inserted. One such procedure is excimer laser ablation which is an ablative process of removing surface tissue of the anterior and/or posterior capsule to create a smooth surface so that an intraocular lens can be set in place.
Excimer laser ablation of an intraocular lens may be accomplished by first creating a bubble of fluid, for example saline, by injecting a predetermined volume of fluid into the lens capsule or capsular bag prior to creating an opening in the capsular bag by use of an excimer laser. The bubble is then moved about by moving the shaft of the laser fiber so that a track of several different bubbles is formed across the anterior capsular surface. This procedure is time consuming and must be repeated several times at different locations to complete the capsulorhexis and to treat the rest of the capsular bag to insure a smooth opening and to break up any adherent membranes, that may still be present in the anterior lens capsule.
Another method of fixing an intraocular lens in place involves suturing a loop of surgical filament to the intraocular lens and then bringing the filament through the cornea in front of the iris, and out of the eye near the scleral incision. After the filament is drawn through the sclera, the ends of the filament are tied and cut, thus providing a temporary fixation for the lens. After the healing process, the filament is removed from the eye. A disadvantage of using a surgical filament is that it is very difficult to control the tension of the suture since it is pulled by the surgeon through a small passageway under poor visibility.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,897 discloses an apparatus for positioning an artificial intraocular lens in a lens capsule. The apparatus comprises a lens holding member which is adapted to hold an artificial lens such as a deformable or expandable ball. The lens holding member has at least one aperture for receiving a portion of the edge of a capsular bag. When in position, the ball exerts pressure onto the bag, thus reducing the volume of the bag which enlarges the bag opening.
There are also several other techniques for securing an artificial intraocular lens in place. A typical method for securing the intraocular lens is by way of sutures. An intraocular lens may also be fixed by sutures which attach the lens to the scleral spur to the ciliary sulcus or zonules. Another method of fixing the intraocular lens in place is to place a loop of surgical filament through a scleral tunnel, and pull the loop of filament through the sclera, then tying and cutting the ends of the suture to form a temporary fixation for the lens. After the healing process, the filament is removed from the eye. This surgical procedure requires the making of a scleral tunnel which is time consuming.
There are some other known methods for securing an artificial intraocular lens in place in which portions of the periphery of the artificial lens are physically attached to the eye. One such method involves forming an annular portion in the edge of the lens capsule. An example of this type of method is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,462. Another method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,573,998 involves forming an annular band of light-sensitive material in a portion of the edge of the lens capsule, and using light to secure the lens to the eye. Still another method involves forming a flange or flange portion around the outer edge of the lens to form a mechanical interlock between the lens and the periphery of the eye, as illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,447 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,282,852.
The methods of securing a lens in place using sutures or surgical filaments and known fixation methods have several drawbacks. First, the methods require extensive tissue manipulation such as puncturing, suturing and tying to secure the lens in place. This requires time consuming procedures which have a higher potential of surgical complications such as infection, accidental laceration of other structures, hemorrhage and damage to tissue. Second, a serious complication may be caused by placing a suture loop around the iris as a result of this movement, which leads to an undesired change in refraction of the lens. Third, during surgery, there is a potential for injury to the eye such as an inadvertent puncture or tearing of the cornea and/or the lens capsule.
Methods for preparing an eye for an artificial intraocular lens include surgical techniques, i.e., forming a scleral tunnel or a large and continuous incision, and non-surgical techniques, i.e., cutting an appropriately sized artificial intraocular lens and inserting it into the eye. The former method involves making a scleral tunnel which is time consuming.
With regard to the latter method, some prior art intraocular lens insertion devices utilize a vacuum in which the intraocular lens is inserted. Other prior art intraocular lens insertion devices do not use a vacuum to secure the intraocular lens within the eye. These prior art insertion devices are designed so that, when inserted into the eye, an intraocular lens is held in place by the natural suction of the eye.
One such prior art intraocular lens insertion device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,408 to Smith et al. In this device, a series of plates pivot to open and close an open top channel for receiving a lens. The plates are controlled by an actuator having a pair of hydraulic rods and a solenoid which connects to a dial to turn the rod tips in and out. The force with which the device is inserted into an eye will vary directly with the degree of hydraulic pressure being exerted onto the plates in the insertion device.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,789 discloses a prior art intraocular lens insertion device which includes a hollow tube connected to a source of vacuum to remove all air from the tube so that a lens can be placed into a prepared eye and secured in place. However, the device includes no means for aligning the eye or for properly aligning an intraocular lens prior to insertion. Furthermore, since the lens is placed into an eye through the open distal end of the hollow tube, no air escapes the distal end of the tube during the vacuuming process and before the lens is inserted. This causes the intraocular lens to be sucked against the opposite open end of the tube which forces the intraocular lens to be misaligned with the eye.
There is a need for an intraocular lens insertion device that can be used in non-surgical, less traumatic procedures and in surgical procedures in which there is no need for making a scleral tunnel. There is also a need for an intraocular lens insertion device which can be used with less than perfect targetting of the intraocular lens by the surgeon, for example in the absence of an accurate laser based method of marking a lens.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:32:51
