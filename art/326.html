The word, 「來」 (come), can be read differently with the Chinese characters it contains, but the meaning is still very much the same. 「来」 (to come, to draw near), is closely related to words that also contain the characters for numbers, such as 「三千里」 (3000 li), and can be used similarly to express the meaning of a thing that comes and yet will never reach a complete end. 「不到時會到」 (It will come to pass, and yet not so soon) sounds like the Chinese equivalent of the English saying, 「Not until...」 which means that someone will come, and yet will not do so in the immediate future.

It could also mean that a process will come to pass, but will be incomplete or will not be finished before certain other conditions are met or until a certain time has passed. With 「來」 (to come) there can also be a sense of the future that you are not sure about. 「不到時會到」(It will come to pass, and yet not so soon) is certainly a possible translation for the lines. It is interesting to note, though, that no one has yet mentioned how the English could possibly mean that, only how it is similar to another line. There is actually another meaning, but I believe 「不到時會到」can be properly interpreted and understood by looking at the rest of the lines.

For example, a few lines down it says, 「著近不到（長山高）升堂時。」(In every place, the near and the far are inseparable from each other. No one knows when the time will come for the high hall to reach its apex.)

「著近不到」 (nearer and farther) is another way of saying 「不到時會到」 (it will come to pass, but not so soon). The difference between the two is a simple one. Both of them can mean that a time is coming that will be so good that it is unknown whether it will ever come or not, but the idea in 「著近不到」is that something is happening right now that is so good that it has not come to an end. 「著近不到」 is a good translation, but it is almost as though you have not started to explain the meaning of a line.

This may be a bit too philosophical for a dictionary, and this post might seem as if I am trying to argue that 「不到時會到」(It will come to pass, and yet not so soon) means that something will happen in the future that can never be fully understood or explained. It is as if I believe that everything must be figured out and understood now because it will not come to pass until the end. I don't think anyone could claim that I believe that the meaning of a single Chinese word could be a puzzle. Of course, it can be difficult to determine, but the line would be difficult to explain with the first translation that I have given.

「不到時會到」 can be understood without knowing that it is related to a Chinese word. I believe this to be the case because a translator can always give another explanation that fits a different set of conditions.

I have mentioned two other meanings of the word, 「來」 (to come) earlier, one meaning is to come here, and the other meaning is to approach a place. As for the two other meanings, the other words with the same characters, 「著」 (to hang, to suspend) and 「近」 (near) seem to have something to do with events occurring after the events of the three phrases of lines 「應當須臾不能歸。」 (If you should happen to be here, it is impossible that you should do otherwise.)

With 「著近不到」 (nearer and farther), we are dealing with a different matter. The one to be discussed earlier deals with the future, but this comes from the past and is about people who are long gone. It is related to the phrases, 「歷盡風險」 (have made the most daring leap), 「憂無執卻」 (not afraid of ruin), 「無事無病能平安臨」 (untroubled by illness, and so forth).「 」 (courageous) can also have a connection with 「談愴吾何。」 (How dare I, I have no words.).

At any rate, if one knows the other things listed above, then the meaning of 「不到時會到」 is not difficult. We are, after all, discussing the events before the time of 「應當須臾不能歸。」(If you should happen to be here, it is impossible that you should do otherwise.), which were the events that occurred during the Warring States Period. They were events that are mentioned by Confucius in the Analects, or events that have been documented in the history book of China.

In the Analects, it is recorded, 「 」。The phrase, 「著近不到」, which is not difficult to understand, can be interpreted as a comment by K'ung Fu Tzu, who mentions, 「 。」 (I am not wise enough to fathom things).

That is not it. You may interpret it any way you like. 「著近不到」 can also mean, 「著近在。」(To be nearby.) I, however, am not too sure. It seems that 「著近在」 means, 「有相近」, and, 「著近不到」, with the words, 「近不到」, can be translated as, 「有相近并远不及」(you are just as close, and yet far from that which is being described.)

「有相近」 is an essential part of 「著近不到」(you are just as close, and yet far from that which is being described.), and while it may be an easy translation for some people to understand, it is, after all, not the way that I intend to interpret the phrase. I was going to say that I am not too sure how the phrase should be understood, but that is not really the case.

In short, I would say that 「著近不到」 can be understood and explained by looking at the translation for the phrase, 「應當須臾不能歸」(If you should happen to be here, it is impossible that you should do otherwise.).

Finally, it is better to try a different translation because the meaning of the phrase can be understood by other people with other interpretations, and because I am not that great of a writer and would not be able to explain it as well as someone who speaks fluent Chinese or someone who reads Chinese very well. 「著近不到」can mean that the phrase is used when the original speaker hopes that the other person will understand the true meaning of a line.

We might know how the translator has decided to translate it, and we might not like that translation, but we must be grateful that he or she has decided to provide the details that we want. I might not like what he or she has done, and I will always be able to say that he or she has explained the phrase in a way that I do not understand, but after all, that was not the purpose of this translation.

「 」 (to have) can be used with the word, 「能」 (able) and 「 」 (can), in order to mean, 「能 」(able)。It is a way of thinking about someone's ability, and there is more than one possibility of having it.

「 」 (to do) can be used with the word, 「能」 (able) and 「 」 (can), in order to mean, 「能 」(able)。It is a way of thinking about someone's ability, and there is more than one possibility of doing it.

「 」 (to have) can also be used with the word, 「能」 (able) and 「 」 (can), in order to mean, 「能 」(able)。It is a way of thinking about someone's ability, and there is more than one possibility of trying to have it.

「 」 (able to) is simply 「能」, (able to)。

「 」 (can) is more than just being able to do something, and the expression 「能」 (able to) would be better than 「能 」(able). The same goes for 「 」 (can) and 「 」(able to).「 」 (can</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:25
