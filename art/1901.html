Oh wait no it's not.

I know it was a funny game but it's time to get back on topic.



I don't really have much else to say here besides.......



Thanks for playing! This is my first update, I hope you guys like it.



The new update is much smaller, but more stable.



I fixed the loading screen when first starting.

As before, you still see the 'Preloading' message on the top of the loading screen.



One of the fixes was to fix this issue:

https://bugs.mikro-code.com/view.php?id=3346



-Fixed broken path saving



Another bug I fixed:

https://bugs.mikro-code.com/view.php?id=3430



-Fixed an issue that could cause memory leaks and crashing on android



I also created some sounds that will be used when you die on any deathmatch.



There's still a lot of things I need to work on, especially the new menu screen where you actually select the mode. For now I'll just keep updating and fixing the small stuff,



I'm going to make a small guide on how to play, and perhaps give an explanation of all the controls.



Edit: Oh yeah, remember I need to make an intro for the menu screen.

Here's a preview for the menu screen.



Oh no, I messed up the text! So I'll leave the screen to the right alone, and replace the text with this.



Sorry for that,



Next up, I need to make a new menu icon and some graphics for it.



EDIT: I can't believe it, I've made a new menu icon! New update now out, version 0.3.6 is out.



I fixed a lot of things, but one issue is that the game crashes a lot when I get in close proximity with the game over screen.

Fixed major problem where the game crashed on android when exiting a game, also fixed some more random bugs that people have been reporting.



I hope you guys enjoy.

Bug fixes, new Menu icon added.

Added a lot of new sounds.

Pause menu is now a single pause menu for all situations.





Version 0.1.1

https://imgur.com/a/NvJI4 #mce_temp_url#



New update:

Gamemodes, Game Over, Options, Stats, and other improvements.



Fixed an issue with the menu icon of the pause menu. I think I should have it fixed, but it still shows some of the previous icon.



Gamemode's menu icon and stats are based off the icons from the main menu.



Just added these ones:
