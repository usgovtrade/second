"Fear," which opens Slayer's album, is a track about the band's late front man, Jeff Hanneman. While the songs on "Show No Mercy" and "Undisputed Attitude" deal with Hanneman's death, "Fear" deals with the "emotional hangover" that comes after.

Slayer is set to release "Show No Mercy" in the U.S. in January.
