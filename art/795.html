"So, what did you find?" ......

"Nothing, the ship is an empty hulk, they all went missing, they did a mass jump to a unknown location. ...... All of the weapons too, they were all disassembled or missing"

'.....I was not aware that they were equipped with weapons?'

'.....That's classified information sir, but that is also part of the reason for this investigation and why it is not permitted to publish these results. They are also using the same stealth technology that I have given you as proof of life."

"That was one of the reasons that I gave you so much funding and support, I am sure that it will prove to be a worthwhile endeavor, that you will soon find evidence of the lifeforms that were aboard the ETL's ship, and that they are alive and fighting back!"

"Yes sir, I know the technology is classified but I can also confirm that it is real and active, the ships' weapons were deactivated but there is other evidence of their existence."

"We have two more missions to carry out, with this knowledge, will you continue in your position?"

"Absolutely, I'm sure that your intelligence operatives are working overtime as we speak, and so are mine. I don't know how many people were aboard the ETL ships but there must have been hundreds of them. I think we would be better able to solve the mystery if we continue with the same crew on the same team, it will at least prove to us what is currently there. If there is no life and they used the stealth technology as you claim then they would most likely not be able to detect us and our stealth technology as well"

"Then we will continue as planned"

There was a brief pause of silence, before Mr. Jones nodded his head as he spoke to the intercom, "Okay Captain, I guess we have a new mission, set course for the planet, we are now on our way."

"Okay Captain, so then we shall have no delay on our new mission............."

"You will have it when you have it Captain, I'm sure you have a lot on your mind........."

"Yes I do, but that is a story for another day" ........

Mr. Jones was indeed telling a story, though nobody knew what the story was all about. It's not every day that you get such a great gift, and even better when it gives you a new story to tell, a different story than the one you already know, it adds to your credibility and gives you a bigger story. .........

The second mission was carried out successfully, as well as the third, and fourth. The entire planet had been surveyed for evidence of any kind of living creature or remnants of life. Nothing was found. ...........

It was then that Captain Jones received a new promotion. He had been promoted to Captain of his own ship, where he would head out to space and attempt to track down the missing ships and anyone who had been to the lost planets. He would make it his personal mission to finish the last mission that he was given by the ETL's, in spite of the newly discovered planets that did not contain any trace of life.

That's why he was so interested in the sixth planet, because he already had enough mysteries. He felt that he needed to prove that his ship was still in his control and that nobody had any influence on his abilities as a leader of men. ............

Chapter 25

We have reached the end of the sixth chapter in this exciting and strange story. It has been a long journey for all of us. I hope that you found it all interesting and that you learned more about life on earth. Even if you have read this book before, I hope that you will once again read this and think about all of the characters and their motivations. ............ I have enjoyed writing this book and it has been a journey for me as well. I am sure that we will all learn a lot about life and our place in the universe.

I would like to thank you for your support and I would like to be a part of your next project. I am always looking for more projects to work on and it would be great to contribute to your next great story, which you too have started. ............

You can now return to the rest of your life. You have done well and I hope that you have enjoyed the story, whatever your thoughts are, I look forward to hearing from you again.

With every good wish for a great future, I remain your obedient servant,
