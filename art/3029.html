Lake Erie Islands: The Lake Erie Islands are a string of small towns a couple of miles off the mainland. They are connected by a series of bridges and causeways. The majority of them lie in Ottawa County, which also encompasses Presque Isle, the county seat and the area's largest town. Ottawa Lake extends south of Presque Isle, connecting to Lake Erie and the rest of the Great Lakes. It's named after a Canadian Indian tribe that once lived in the area.
