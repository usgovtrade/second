You have to know how to read a script, not just your lines. It is just as important to know how to read the part of the script that’s called casting, that is, the part that tells you who to get the job. That's where you come in. By definition, we have to look for someone who's different, someone who's more interesting than the people who normally get this part. But that's not enough. You've got to remember one thing: If your name is up on the screen, you're the one who's gonna be remembered for the entire film. Remember that. It's your face that's gonna be seen around the world, not a star's.

Look at it this way: Would you have sex with someone you don't know? Or someone with whom you've only had one date? Of course not. Now imagine you've had a one-night stand, and now you've run into your new lover at a family dinner, and she doesn't recognize you. I'd be embarrassed and a little ashamed, wouldn't you? Well, that's how you should feel about acting. If you look familiar to anyone, it's because they saw your face on TV, or in a movie, or in a commercial. And believe me, it's not always easy to know if the person you're meeting is gonna know you.

Now, you can see how getting the job for this movie might be a bit more difficult. This is a film that the producer has already agreed to pay $8 million to cast. And when your name comes up, it will be in writing. The studio and producers have already agreed to have you play this part, and if you reject the part, the other actors have to get paid for coming to the set, and the studio may be able to recoup the money lost in casting you and then having to reshoot the whole thing. Even if the other actors have had the screen test and had the auditions, even if they're already fully prepared, it won't matter.

And here's the thing: When you get the job, you have to work like a dog. If you're not up for the part, they can always get someone else. They can't hire someone who isn't prepared, can't teach someone who doesn't want to learn, can't create what isn't there. But if they do, they'll be sorry. If you want this job—if you really want this job—you'll be on time, learn your lines, be easy to work with, come in every day ready to do the work, and turn in quality work. You must do your best, and you must understand that your performance will be what keeps the company alive. Because if you don't work well in this film, then how will people see you and remember you? If they can't find you and remember you, they won't hire you again. And if they can't hire you again, how do you expect to get that new job you've been dreaming about?

Is It Really That Difficult?

Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. If you're an actor, you're on-camera 90% of the time—at least when you're on a movie set.

It's true that for a little while you're a big fish in a small pond. But then you move to the big pond. And all those actors who moved up from smaller movies to do films that make the studios millions of dollars? That all went away when the camera turns, and the sound man says, "CUT!"

The casting agents want you to work hard. They don't want you to be lazy. They want you to work every day, so they can get their next job, which will be yours if you work well, but they will not go out of their way to work with you. Don't think of yourself as just another actor. Think of yourself as an actor for hire, one who's chosen to work for them for a few days. You must understand that if you do not perform well, this production will have to reshoot, with a different actor who has to learn your lines and memorize his part. You don't want that. So do not be disappointed when casting people reject you for roles. They don't like giving good things away. That is why there are so many actors who are cast in crap movies and are constantly rejected by casting directors and producers.

Don't forget that in this business you're a product. The better you look and the more of a name you make, the better your chances are of getting another job. And actors want jobs. They may not want them as much as they want to make money and get the limelight, but they do want them. So you have to make it known that you want them. Work hard and go to work looking your best. If you fail to do so, then people will assume that you do not want to work and you will go nowhere.

The more successful you become, the more responsibility is placed on you. It is because of the choices you make that many of your colleagues fail.

The Curse of Success

I read a story about a young girl who was dating a very successful actor. She was about 17, and her father was a movie producer. The girl's dad brought her to one of her boyfriend's auditions.

The successful actor was cast in a part in a movie that was going to be filming in seven weeks, and he had to be at the studio by then. He was also doing several other movies that were starting in three months.

The casting agent called to tell him he was fired. The first movie was no longer a possibility and he had to get out of the other three. "Who else do you know who could possibly replace you?" she asked. The guy looked at the girl and smiled, "Honey, this is the way it is in the business. I got paid a lot of money, and now I gotta go find another sucker to take my place."

I was once asked to come and help cast a film called _Big Hero 6_ —a Disney production that became a huge success and spawned merchandise. The movie was directed by John Lasseter and produced by Walt Disney Animation Studio.

I was working on the set when the production manager approached me. "Hey, Mike, do you have any friends who could get the part of Hiro?" he asked.

I looked at him, confused. "Yes," I replied. "This guy," I said, pointing to one of the crew members. "Why would you ask me?"

He looked at me and pointed to one of the crew. "Mike, look at how he looks, and then look at the way your friend looks." And there it was. My friend didn't have the face for the part, and he needed another face for the production. That was all there was to it. The director couldn't see anyone else for the part and had to go with someone else. But even though that's the truth, you will still find actors who will tell you they were "forced" to replace someone else.

It doesn't matter if you're the director or producer or writer. You have to go with the best. The casting directors and producers don't want to be the ones responsible for failure. That's why it's always a struggle to get a movie made. It is not your producer's job to be nice to you and to make sure everyone on the set is doing his or her job. That's why there are people on set who are working. And if you aren't working, why are you there? For most actors, it's an unpaid job.

So if you don't work well, the company will replace you, but if you do work well, you'll probably be asked to come back for a larger role. Remember: A little job can go a long way.

Here's another thing. A successful actor is often asked to star in a movie, or a sequel or spin-off to a film he or she starred in. The more successful they are, the more actors are interested in hiring them for any number of things. You will get called and asked to come in for a meeting. The actor will do his or her very best to get you the part. However, if you don't work out, the studio will go with another actor. The job will go to a star who will be given the part, and you will get offered less work.

There are many instances of actors coming back, but there are also many actors who don't, and their reasons vary. But I always hear the same thing: "I am not good enough."

What you have to understand is that you have to be a good enough actor to do all the things you want to do in this business. Don't be surprised if someone gives you the part in a film. Many actors would kill for a part in the movie of their choice, but they don't get the part because someone else wants it. In this business, you must do your best, and you must be better than the other person who wanted the part. This doesn't mean you're second best. It doesn't mean you'll fail. It just means that someone else has to die to give you a chance</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:53
