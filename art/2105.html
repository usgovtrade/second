Not at all. I should know better by now. I don’t know what’s going on in my life, but I’m afraid.

I sit up and find my shirt, pulling it on and brushing my hair as if I were preparing for a day in court. I pull my knees into my chest and look up at the ceiling. Maybe there is some truth to this after all.

The pain in my chest is lessened with a thought: I am a bad person. That’s the crux of this problem. Sure, it’s in the back of my mind now, but that doesn’t mean I won’t think about it from now on. And I don’t deserve to have a boyfriend. Not anymore.
