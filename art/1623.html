## To the Reader

I pray you have found this novel to be an inspiration to you, just as it was for me. Perhaps this is the first of a new series or perhaps it is the one book that shows you there is more to you than meets the eye. As much as I would like to make each story unique, I had a story arc I had to follow and, therefore, I was unable to create unique new characters in each story.

If, however, this was not the book for you then feel free to let me know why and, more important, let me know what inspired you. I would love to hear from you and will gladly reply to your comments.

### INTRODUCTION

After two decades of writing, I can honestly say my debut novel is the one of which I am most proud. The idea was born from my need to encourage and challenge women who were in a mess and, after a year of fighting for my life and a near-death experience, I am more convinced than ever of the importance of the message within this book.

_When You Meet the One_ offers a unique perspective of what it is like to be married. Most couples are familiar with some aspects of marriage but not others. What makes this book unique is that each story focuses on something different—how your partner deals with finances, whether he or she has the confidence to be the only breadwinner, how they choose to parent, how they deal with the challenges they encounter in life, etc.

Although I have been married for twenty years, these issues, as I outlined in the introduction of this book, are also present in the lives of many of my friends and they have offered valuable insights to help mold this book. The information I gave to them was not as detailed but more of a sketch than a novel.

Many people will argue that the truth is only found in Scripture, but that simply is not true. Many times the truth found in scripture has been twisted through the ages, making it wrong. When Jesus spoke, many of his teachings were about peace, love, and unity, and it is because of those views that we can say he is the Son of God and is God. If people want to say he is the Son of God because he said those words, I will still stand with him, but that is not all there is to it. I am not in any way perfect and nor are my thoughts or even my words. I</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:15
