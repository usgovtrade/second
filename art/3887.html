The family said they had not yet spoken to the teen’s parents about the suicide, but said they were not aware of any problems. The school had not been in touch with the family since the death, though they were expecting an appointment from the school on Monday, the family said.

The teenager’s parents have not yet visited the family. “In the first 48 hours, I think you really need to be there for yourself and your kids and not be jumping up and down screaming about legal consequences and everything else,” the student’s father told CNN’s Ashleigh Banfield.

“The only thing we know is that we have lost our son, our baby,” he said.

In Britain, school officials said the boy was known to be autistic and had been receiving education support.


“This is a tragic case for the family concerned and also for his school and our thoughts are with him and his family and with our staff at the school at this sad time,” Mike Clancy, a spokesman for the U.K. Department for Education, said in a statement.

He said the cause of the boy’s death was being investigated. “At this stage, we believe that his death was not related to bullying or harassment,” he said.

In one video shot in May, a crowd of pupils were seen hurling abuse at an autistic student, including making fun of his disability and the way he speaks, as well as using insults about gay and transgender people. Another video shot in March shows the same boy being punched.

The videos were provided to CNN by another student at the school. The teen shown in them asked not to be identified because his family was concerned about the safety of the students involved.

The videos appear to be shot by the same person, in successive days, according to the student.

At the school, pupils were divided into four houses, and the victim was in a different house from the alleged bully, who is also autistic, the student said.

In a separate incident in March at the same school, a 14-year-old student was charged with assault in connection with an assault against a peer who was described by classmates as “transgender,” according to school administrators.

The school did not have a policy on “bullying and harassment,” according to its website. The school’s code of conduct “outlines standards of behavior that all members of the school community should learn and adopt,” the website says.


“Students and parents are advised that harassment that involves personal or private information about another person will not be tolerated. Students who are subjected to or witness harassment or disrespect toward themselves, their peers, or their property will also be addressed.”

The school community is “always on the lookout for ways to help each other,” the code adds.
