"Sure, I'll put an order in." "Thanks, hon." "Bye." "Bye." "What are you doing on your day off?" "Oh, you know..." "Took a little trip down to Mexico." "Went swimming." "How's Kirsten?" "Fine." "She was here earlier, I just sent her home." "She didn't feel so good." "Yeah, you know, she was really pale and clammy when I met her." "Well, she really needs to be getting some rest." "Don't we all, right?" "So it's been over a week, and still no word from Scott?" "Did you try his cell?" "Oh, yeah." "His voice mail said he was out of town on business." "Well, you should try his partner Derek." "He has a phone number and you'll see it on the bill when you sign for it." "Yeah, all right." "Well, if that doesn't work you should just try calling him again." "He's not that bad of a guy." "Yeah, right." "So what do you think you're going to do with the extra bedroom?" "Oh, I dunno." "I thought I would turn it into a nursery, you know?" "Oh, I'm sorry, Kirsten." "I hope it's not too awkward." "Not at all." "Let's just hope things work out better between them." "Hi, dad." "Where are you?" "I was hoping I could see you." "I'm at my friend Rachel's house." "I can't talk right now, dad." "If you call me back," "I'll see if I can come by later." "Bye." "Thanks." "So did you decide what you wanted for your birthday?" "Actually, I'm looking at them now." "They're really cute and I just want to make sure that we can afford them." "Oh, no, don't." "They're so expensive." "It's okay." "No, you deserve them." "After all you do for me." "Here." "I wanted to give you some sort of a thank you for this evening." "I'm sorry for the way things have been going for me lately." "It's not your fault, dad." "I mean, all I can say is that I love you." "That's all you need to say." "Okay, I need to leave in a minute." "We're going to be making some food." "Good to see you're coming out of your shell a little." "Hey, who says I'm coming out of my shell?" "Can you make it five, so I can run and get a shower?" "Sure." "You know, dad, we need to talk about what happened between us last night." "We were so stupid." "We thought we knew each other, but we don't." "What do you mean?" "It was a lot to ask of a girl like me." "No, you were great." "Okay, well, I mean, you weren't that great." "What do you mean?" "Well, you were so mean to me." "I don't understand what I did." "You were totally flirting with other guys." "You totally humiliated me in front of everyone." "You tried to pull out of our date at the last minute." "No, I didn't." "You did." "It's not my fault you chickened out." "And then you made fun of my family." "Yes." "I'm sorry, alright?" "I..." "I lost it and it was stupid." "Do you want to go out with me again?" "Yeah, I do." "Well, then let's go out tonight, as friends." "But why?" "Because I'm a grown up and I don't think it's that weird." "I'm glad you changed your mind, actually." "So..." "Are you gonna tell me why you're here?" "Well, actually..." "It's not gonna be easy." "I kinda like you, okay?" "I mean..." "I think about you a lot." "Maybe you should leave before I become more of a gentleman and start punching you." "Yeah, that would be really bad." "Thank you, thank you." "Thank you." "There was no need to be rude." "Kirsten, I am here as a messenger of the truth." "Kirsten, you're in danger!" "I just need a minute." "Do you have a minute, please?" "Yes, yes, one minute." "Yeah, that's great." "Thanks." "Oh, she looks so beautiful!" "Hi." "Hey, what's the matter?" "I just got some really bad news." "What happened?" "It's Scott." "What?" "Kirsten, he's my only son." "My only..." "Only..." "Scott's his name." "You think I don't know that?" "Do I think you don't know that?" "Oh, I'm sorry." "Look, don't be so mad at me." "Okay, forget it." "I don't know why I said that." "It's not your fault." "Yeah, that's true." "Scott's just so much like him and I just miss him so much." "I don't know what's going on with me." "Hey, come on in." "Yeah, thanks." "I was worried about you." "Why?" "Just in case you couldn't reach me by phone." "Well, did you talk to Scott?" "Yeah, he said he can't talk right now and he's stuck at work." "He said he'd call me back." "Are you sure he wants to see you?" "It's not just him." "It's me too." "I'd really like to get over this whole fighting thing." "I think we could do it, if you'll let me try." "Are you sure you can deal with it?" "I can handle it." "I want to be with you, dad." "I really do." "I love you, kid." "But, son, you can't go back on your word." "I'm sorry." "You and I are gonna talk about this later." "You said one of the other patients was going to be there." "What are we doing here?" "You'll see." "I'll wait in the car." "Yeah, I won't be long." "Dad?" "Hey, come on in." "Hey." "You're alone?" "Yeah, just me and the bats." "I'm sorry I'm late." "I just got in from work." "You look really nice." "Thanks." "How did you get in here?" "Dad's a doctor." "Of course he is." "So how are you feeling?" "Okay." "Yeah?" "So you guys are back together?" "Well, yeah." "I think we can get past this and..." "And what?" "Maybe get back to where we were before." "That sounds really good." "You look really pretty." "You know, tonight has been really weird." "I'm sorry." "It's not your fault, dad." "You don't have to keep apologizing for everything you do." "I'm sorry." "It's all right." "Look, I guess I shouldn't have gone out tonight." "Why not?" "I feel stupid." "I know you don't like to go out anymore." "I don't want you to stop doing things because you think that that might make me feel bad." "I just..." "I want us to be able to be friends." "You're right." "Yeah, I'm sorry." "I know you don't need me to tell you that I love you." "I just want you to know that you're always going to be my baby." "That's sweet." "Aren't you going to tell me what that was all about?" "Oh, well, you know, our daughter was being a real pain, so I just had to discipline her." "But that's it." "Nothing serious." "It's not that serious, right?" "Well, I think it's serious enough that it won't happen again." "Okay." "So how is she?" "She looks pretty sad." "Well, that's just a stage." "You know how kids can be." "Oh, look at this, it's a gift certificate." "You guys want to grab a bite to eat?" "Well, I..." "Thanks, I don't think so." "What's the matter?" "Are you sure you don't want to eat something?" "Yeah, I'll get something in here." "Well, your dad is so sweet, right?" "Yeah." "But sometimes I wish he'd stop worrying so much about me." "Well, I think that what he wants to know is that you're okay." "Yeah, but I'm not." "I never will be." "The best thing to do is to make friends in school, okay?" "And you can make lots of friends at school, if you just try, Kirsten." "I just don't want my family to worry about me." "You guys are the only thing that matters to me." "Yeah, but no matter what happens," "I'll always be there for you." "Do you want a sandwich?" "No, I'm all set."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:05:00
