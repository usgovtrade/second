New Yorkers Against Fracking is a group that opposes natural gas extraction via fracking in New York State.

On November 17, 2013, New Yorkers Against Fracking, Clean Water Action, the Council on Downstate Agriculture, New York State Catholic Conference, and the United Farm Workers joined together to file a federal lawsuit against the DEC to stop fracking in New York.

The new settlement is meant to "strengthen regulations for drilling, impose new cleanup requirements for former gas fields, and place a one-year moratorium on drilling pending the completion of a study of water supplies in the state."  The NY State Department of Environmental Conservation has approved six of the ten "voluntary" "frack-free" pacts.

Environmentalists and opponents of fracking claim that the process of hydraulic fracturing is dangerous and should be banned throughout the state.  Opponents claim the process contaminates the ground and even forces groundwater and drinking water to become contaminated. While fracking in New York State has not yet begun, a few companies have submitted requests for permits to drill.

Public health risk

According to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, about 75 percent of the wells drilled between 2007 and 2009 used a form of fracking called hydrofracturing.  In New York State, about 75 percent of the wells drilled between 2007 and 2009 used a form of fracking called hydrofracturing.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, hydrofracking can result in contaminated ground and drinking water supplies. It was found that hydrofracking had contaminated the drinking water in Pavillion, Wyoming in 2010.

Hydrofracking was banned in New York State in March 2012.
