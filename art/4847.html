What is an invasive species?

An invasive species is any species that has become established and spread where it does not belong. Invasive species have no natural predators or controls on them in their new environment. These species can cause harm and even death to people, livestock and wild animals.

Examples of invasive species include but are not limited to foxes, rats, and rabbits.

What are some ways to combat the spread of invasive species?

Removal and prevention: If a species is already established, removal of animals or habitat is the only way to stop its spread.

Predator management: Ants, rodents, some wildlife and large animals such as deer can be controlled to decrease the population of the invasive species.

Biological control: Insect or chemical methods are used to control the spread of invasive species.

Bird control: Birds that are carriers of the disease can carry or spread diseases to other animals. Diseases spread by animals including birds and wildlife, such as bird flu.

Wildlife control: If a species of animal is in danger of being endangered, one way to save the animal is to kill the animal.

Diet Control: The food that the animal eats can also be a factor in whether the animal spreads to a new area. If an animal is eating garbage or wildlife, it is more likely to spread to another area.
