As it happens this year, it fell to the Labour leader to get me out to Bath for the day to see that wonderful and extraordinary cathedral. I was the designated driver (I take no pride in driving for a living) so I took a little time to explore this magnificent and venerable old building.

It’s certainly impressive, at any time of the day, but particularly in the late evening, when the shadows fall and you can appreciate all the details of the windows, carvings, inscriptions, architecture… It really is quite breath-taking.

There’s something very special about it, something unique. I’m not sure what it is, but it’s like that in all my favourite places. It’s particularly noticeable in smaller places, such as the ‘cathedrals of the air’ (or is it ‘cathedrals of heaven’?…) That is those really intimate, small and beautiful churches that are the hallmark of this country. I think it’s probably something to do with the proximity of those churches to our daily lives and the fact that the majority of our people were born and bred here and are familiar with every foot of this country, so there’s an overwhelming sense of belonging and rootedness in our own land.

On the whole, I don’t think that there are many English churches which reach the standard of this building (which should be classified as a ‘major national monument’). It’s not the building that is the marvel, it’s the story. Look at the stained glass windows. Look at the carvings and inscriptions, the architectural detail. Look at the sculpture of those lions. It’s telling of a time when there was a wealthy ruling class. It’s not difficult to imagine the opulence of those bishops, priests, monks and nuns.

Take, for instance, the inscription under one of the two main portals.

Pray for the Souls in Purgatory

‘Sovereign, Lord and Kyrie Eleison.’ It’s a reference to Christ’s title as ‘Kyrie Eleison’. It’s a reference to the three orders of prayer for the dead (i.e. ‘Pray for the Souls in Purgatory’). (There was a special devotion to the Sacred Heart around 1700. This was perhaps inspired by the devotion that had appeared in France. In the main aisle of the Cathedral there is a figure of Christ in Majesty, crowned with the Sacred Heart. There are no references in the cathedral to purgatory.)

It’s an allusion to another time. This building was built, in the medieval period, on the ruins of a much older one, and the newer one was much richer and more extravagant than the older one.

Look at those carvings and inscriptions. How many of them do you know?

Take another look at those lions on the west front. Look closely at them again.

Look at them, and then at those above them.

“He who looks attentively at the statues of the two noble groups that are carved above the large west entrance on either side of the statue of Christ will be amazed at their similarity. All sorts of interpretations of what they represent have been made, some absurd, others clever, none of them convincing. They seem to be very noble-looking figures, perhaps two of the founders of the cathedral and perhaps the two bishops who worked with him in dedicating the church. The figure on the left has three bands on his robe of office (a bishop’s hat) and is obviously the senior figure. He wears a miter and is holding a pastoral staff in his left hand and a Gospel in his right hand. He is giving a blessing. His companion, who is dressed like him, is wearing a long garment (like a robe), and over it a mantle that can be taken for a bishop’s cope. His right hand is holding the Gospel, his left hand a pastoral staff, and he also looks as though he were blessing. There is also in the same place, to the left, just under the tympanum, the statue of Christ dressed in long undergarments and mantle, holding up the sacred heart in both hands and making the gesture of benediction.”

These carvings are clearly in response to the carving in London’s Guildhall and the monument to Peter Oliver, the founder of the Royal Society, outside St. John’s Wood. It was not so much an answer to Oliver’s statue, which is so unspecific, as an affirmation of the great achievements and successes of this particular time in our country’s history, and an appeal to their example to the people of the nation.

When I was there it occurred to me that it’s very easy to see what people meant, but very difficult to explain how to do so.

Perhaps it’s possible to say that the images on these statues were the result of a meeting of minds between the bishop and architect, George Basevi. I think we can say that those lions are a celebration of English achievement.

These carvings are an expression of what we achieved under William IV and Victoria and those bishops had the genius and vision to realise that.

England still holds good, and will always do so.

I loved my visit to Bath with you! It is so beautiful, but also such a strange place. It is just such a contrast to the places in England that I know! It’s really just beautiful all around. I can’t really pinpoint why, but I think the architecture really gives you such a sense of place. Also, that’s a long quote from you – it’s really long but it shows how much you thought of it and just how much effort it was to put that together! How did you make it so long like that, I wonder! :)

This is so beautiful! I have only recently discovered your blog and am blown away by the images and the gorgeous photographs you take. I do not have children and the words “our children” always brings tears to my eyes because it</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:44
