That includes getting my book sold with the affiliate link, so it’s about $400 at this point. I make enough money blogging to live on (that’s the biggest bonus of blogging for me) and it’s fun to do because I love to communicate, teach, and inspire. So I love to do that and make a few extra bucks.

I have more ideas on how to make money blogging and I’ll share them with you soon.

I’m thinking of having a few more side-projects to monetize now that I’ve set some of this up for myself, but only if it’s sustainable.

There’s a lot you can make with the internet but it’s also easy to waste your time in the sea of social media, you can get easily distracted with the infinite sources of information available on the internet, and this is something you should really be aware of in 2019.

How can I find real success online? What works for you? Is it a legitimate, good way to make money?

For me, it was reading this book. I have it on audio now and it’s been a wonderful read. (It’s not available in audio in English, but it’s available in French.) I really recommend it, if you’re wanting to monetize and if you have a hard time finding success online. The book will give you all of these strategies to help you grow. It’s taught me a lot and I’ve reread it a lot as well.

As always, comment below and let me know what you think of my list of ways to make money online and with the blog. Feel free to ask me questions or to share with me how you’re making money online!

I’ve always been a frugal and practical person. After getting over ten speeding tickets and being denied a passport, I had to change my attitude.

I love making a budget, researching what’s best for you, and using common sense.

I also give money saving tips on my site here, as well as on our Facebook page, Instagram account, and Twitter. I hope you enjoy my work, and if you want to get in touch, leave me a comment below or send me an email to shannelle.meeks@gmail.com.
