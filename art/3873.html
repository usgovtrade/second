"You Know What That Means, Don't You?" "We Are The Camel." "So..." "This Is What We'll Do." "You Know Your Job." "We All Do." "What About The Cargo?" "We've Got Your Back." "All Right." "So, You're In." "It's Good To Have You Back, Brother." "I Feel Like I Haven't Missed A Thing." "Well, You Have." "He's Back And He's Still A Jerk." "Well, I'm Not Ready To Celebrate Yet, Brian." "Well, You're Never Gonna Be Ready, Mom." "None Of Us Are." "I Mean, We Could Be Dead Tomorrow." "You're Here Today." "That's What Matters." "Brian, That's Not A Very Positive Attitude." "You're Laying Blame On The Wrong Person." "Who?" "The Kid That Got Me Fired?" "Dad's A Jerk." "No One's Pointing The Finger At Dad." "What?" "What?" "What?" "You Have A Problem With Dad?" "No, Brian." "I Have A Problem With You." "Okay, Okay." "I Am Not Angry At You." "You Know What I Think?" "I Think You're Bored." "I Am Not Bored!" "I Am Trying To Have A Serious Conversation" "With You About Moral Values." "There's Nothing Wrong With Moral Values." "Dad's A Hero." "When Did He Become A Hero?" "When I Found Him On The Streets Of Brooklyn." "Do You Even Know What A Hero Is?" "Yeah, The Guy Who Saved Me" "From Wandering Around Alone On The Streets" "Of Brooklyn." "What?" "You Were On Your Own For Five Days" "Before We Found You In That Dumpster." "Are You Serious?" "Yeah." "And I Was 13." "Oh, Don't Make It Sound So Terrible." "I Loved It." "Not Even On Monday?" "Of Course On Monday." "You Wanted To Be A Superhero." "That's What Saved You." "Your Dad Made It Sound Like" "You Were A Tragic Victim Or Something." "That's Why You Got So Mad At Him, Remember?" "I Could Be A Hero." "I Could Be Anything That I Want To Be." "All I Have To Do Is Believe In Myself." "I've Got His Same Spirit, Mom," "And If He Ever Got Out," "He Would Do Anything For Anyone." "He Would Do Anything For Me, For You." "Of Course He Would, Brian." "But I Don't Think Your Dad's In A Place" "To Be Looking For Someone To Serve." "You Know, I Think He's Out There Trying To Save Himself." "That's What Makes Him A Hero." "I Think Dad Wants To Be A Hero Just Like Me." "Oh, Please." "I Thought You Liked Dad." "Of Course I Do." "He's My Dad." "But Don't You Want Him To Be More Than That?" "No!" "He's A Dad." "You're Thinking Of The Mom That Died When I Was 13." "You're Thinking About The Mom That Dad Used To Be." "Brian, I Think You Don't Remember" "What Your Mother Was Like When She Was Older." "Oh, Yeah, Right, Mom, Yeah." "Because You Want Dad To Stay Your Perfect Dad" "All The Time." "And I Want Him To Come Back." "Maybe I'll Wake Up And This Will All Just Be A Dream." "Brian?" "Brian?" "Brian, You Okay?" "Yeah." "I'm Okay." "You Okay?" "You Weren't Sick, Were You?" "No." "I'm Fine." "I Just..." "The Airplane Was Like A Rocking Chair" "And I Was Just..." "I Was Thinking About Gabe." "Gabe?" "Yeah." "Yeah, We Had A Moment" "On The Plane." "And I Just..." "Wanted To See Him Again." "I Don't Know." "It Was Weird." "It Didn't Make Any Sense To Me." "You Go Back And You Try To Imagine" "What It Was Like To Be Born" "And To Be A Baby." "But How Does That Make Any Sense?" "I Don't Know." "I Mean, I Didn't Know Gabe For Long Enough To Be A Baby." "But Then Again..." "He's Not A Baby Anymore, Is He?" "I Mean, He's A Man Now." "I Know." "But Still..." "What If I Had Never Met Him?" "Would I Even Be Alive?" "That's..." "The Stupidest Thing I've Ever Heard." "Hey." "I Didn't Mean It Like That." "It's Just..." "It's The First Time You've Talked About It." "You Have To Take Your Time, Honey." "It's Tough To Talk About." "What Are You Gonna Tell Her?" "That I Don't Know, I Guess." "But For Some Reason," "It Came Into My Head Today" "How Stupid I've Been." "Not As Stupid As Gabe." "Yeah, Right." "Don't You Ever Think About That?" "What?" "That I'm Not The Only One Who's Ever Gotten Hisself" "Into These Kinds Of Situations." "I Didn't Have A Father To Take Care Of Me." "I've Had To Take Care Of Myself" "For A Lot Of Things." "And I Just Wanted To Think" "About That For A Second." "You Know What?" "The Reason I Didn't Like That Mom" "Is Because..." "She Stood By Him." "I Mean, If She Wasn't With Him, Maybe He Wouldn't Have..." "I Don't Know..." "Been Lost In The World So Much" "That He Didn't Have A Chance To Breathe." "She Stood By Him." "I Know." "I Know, Honey." "I Know What You Mean." "Sometimes I Don't Think We Do" "What's In Their Best Interests" "When We Put Them In This Kind Of Position." "Brian..." "I Don't Think You've Been The Only One" "Who's Done That." "Look, We Were So Young," "And You're Older Than Me." "You Probably Just Think" "That You're Not Responsible." "I Mean, That's Probably What I'd Be Thinking." "I'm Sorry." "No, No." "It's Okay." "I Just..." "I Just Wanted To Tell You" "It Feels Really Good To Talk About It." "Let's Do Something Else." "Okay." "Hey, Honey." "Did You Know That It Takes" "The Human Heart About Eight Months" "To Get From The Upper Left Chamber To The Heart?" "No, Why?" "You Know That Whole Heart-Egg-Candy Story?" "We Couldn't Take The Heart Out Of His Body" "Because That Would Destroy The Entire Organ." "So They Just Moved It To The Lower Left Chamber" "And Got It Running With A Fucking Pump" "For, Like, Eight Months." "And Then On The 9th Month" "They Just Stuck It In There, Right In Front Of Him." "He Could See It, I Mean, It's No Exaggeration." "They Just Hooked It Up" "Right In Front Of His Eyes." "Fucking Crazy." "What Kind Of Fucking Crazy?" "Yeah." "Like, What Could That Possibly Do To Him?" "I Don't Know." "It Made Him Sick, That's All I Know." "Oh, Brian." "He Fucking Hates It." "I Just Saw Him Two Months Ago." "He Still Can't Stop Touching It." "He Has To Touch It Like Constantly." "It's Scaring Me." "Well, Maybe If He Wants To Touch It So Badly," "Maybe It's Okay." "Yeah." "Yeah, Yeah, Yeah." "What's That Supposed To Mean?" "I Mean, He Has To Get That Out Of His System," "You Know What I'm Saying?" "He Has To Own It." "That's..." "That's Why I'm Here, You Know." "I Just Felt Guilty" "About Wanting To Be Away From The Family For A While," "So I Tried To Come Back And Take Care Of Dad" "And Everyone, You Know." "I Know." "I Know." "Well, Don't You Think It's Kind Of Ego Building?" "No." "I Mean, If I Get To Take A Vacation" "And Then I Come Back And Everyone Feels Better," "Then I'm Proud Of What I've Done," "You Know, For Them." "I Did That For You, Brian." "I Did That For All Of Us, Brian." "Dad's Looking So Good, Huh?" "Yeah." "When I Look At You Now, Brian," "I Don't See Brian." "Do You Know What I See?" "Yeah, You See Dad, Right?"</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:35
