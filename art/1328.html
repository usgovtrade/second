The dragon will get weaker with each Slayed

When she's down to 0 hp, you must kill her before the timer runs out or she will escape the cave and you'll need to restart the quest to fight her again. If you kill her, you get a chance at a dragon's treasure. This goes on for 25 dragons. Once you slayed them all, you reach the next level. After that you'll go back to level 1 to start the quest over.

You reached the max level of 101

The End of the Legend quest.

Congratulations you have just slayed the ultimate dragon, the Legend Dragon. This was also the first time you saw what an alternate victory text looked like. It actually looked more like a warning. So I wrote this instead...

Congratulations, you have defeated the Legend Dragon!

"Aaagh... I can't move!"

"I need to get out of here!!"

"I can't move!"

"Help me!"

"The dragon's too strong!"

"I'm bleeding to death."

"I'm dead!"

You have now reached level 99.

Congratulations!

The quest ends. Now what? You can't go to Kourend again, not until you take this trip to Orsinium at level 105. You have to move onto something else. If you were using your level 50 to 100 to collect epic levels for your alt, you're done now. If you started this quest to level your character, use another alt. This quest should end right before the second raid you do in Orsinium. Use your newbie gear or level your alt to 85. Your max level will increase very slowly and you should be close to 100.

This was it for now. Congratulations!

Thanks for reading. I'm always open for comments or if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me and post if you can!

Here's a quick side quest that will help you rank up and get EXP from the quests you already have: Drachenfels Dragon Slayer's Quiz. All you have to do is go to Hakkar to find the quest. It's part of the normal Tutorial quests in Ninjago City. This will give you rank 5 for the quest, not the new rank 6 but should still be good enough.

How do I do this? There's a little red dot in the corner of the screen. It's easy to miss but if you're following the quest guide, you should see it near the side of your screen or just a bit to the right. When you right-click on it, it should give you a drop down list:

Now you just click on get dragon slayer rank 5. You will now see the quest name and an orange line to the right. Every time you complete this quest you get 10 Exp points. And the quest will always be available if you go to the same questgiver.

If you complete this quest later in your progress through Drachenfels, you can keep re-doing it to get more points. But only in Drachenfels (or if you complete it but not in the questgiver). To go back to the questgiver, you will have to get to another questgiver or use travel.

There is another quest in the quest giver and you can get both of them done in the same trip to the quest giver if you want. It's just an extra quest point.

You don't need to do every step in the quest (especially if you're just collecting a scroll to a friend or something). You can save the whole thing as one "session" in your quest journal. But if you look closely, the description says you only have to do each one once. So you can skip a step if you want to but keep it marked if you want to get rank 5. And just right click and do them again if you want to.

These are all optional because you get more points and no more exp if you skip anything. The quest will go slower (you're doing 2 quests at once) but if you can handle it, it's worth it. This quest doesn't award EXP in the normal manner. The question is not answered in a way that is already explained in the tutorial quests. You have to make your own connections to get the right answers.

The first step is the quest A New Beginning from the first section of the Drachenfels quest walkthrough. It is in the section titled Dwarven Research: The Quest Begins.

The next step is just a few feet down the same path you came from at the start. If you went the opposite direction, you will need to return to that location and turn around. This time it will be labeled A New Beginning 3. Then just take the new tunnel path and you will end up at the questgiver.

Take the quest out of the quest log and just start the quest as normal. You will need to kill a bunch of monsters. This is mostly dragon trainers. Once they are dead, go to the questgiver. You have to kill 10 drakes. Don't worry. There's a "Berserker" leveling potion so you won't need to kill any dragon to reach this.

In the quest you will need to kill 8 drakes to get the 3rd task completed. The way to do this is to get 3 drakes as a team of 2. Or if you can get 10 drakes, you can do 2 of them in each slot. You have to kill them in the order of 3, 1, and 4. But all you need is 3 so this is easy.

Get the third task done and you can move on. The next tasks should be done in this order:

The First Dragon's Tooth

The Second Dragon's Tooth

Battle in the Dragon Cave

Loot the Dragon's Hoard

Dragons' Treasure

The Quest Ends

Then you can get the reward item you are looking for. The item will be in the same place as where you first found the drake battle and the loot. You will receive the quest log quest: Where Are You Going?

Take this quest to the questgiver and you'll now have a new quest. It is to find the dragon slayer, so head back to the Drachenfels quest walkthrough. First step is to complete Quest:

Drachenfels Dragon Slayer's Quiz.

I already told you how to do this, so keep going through the steps. You are going to have to kill 8 dragon trainers as mentioned in Quest 1-8 above. Once you get back to the questgiver, take this quest out of the quest log. Just go and see the questgiver for another one.

The first section of the quest walkthrough tells you that you need to kill 9 drakes. If you have already done some of the other quests in this section, you may</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:47
