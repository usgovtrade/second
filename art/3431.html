Watts posted a photo of the pair after taking the wheel. "Well done @vitorbelfort, great fight mate. Love the way you always come out and try your best. No one can get to you once you're in the zone. Congratulations for you last fight!" he said.

Lineker, who defeated Rafael dos Anjos via unanimous decision in their UFC on FX 6 matchup, tweeted, "Not as much a win as it was a feeling" while noting that he's always wanted to fight with Belfort.

The event also included the fight between Yana Kunitskaya and Shayna Baszler. Kunitskaya won by unanimous decision to become the new women's bantamweight champion.

Brazilian striker Renan Barao also beat Brazilian fighter Evan Dunham in a unanimous decision. The event had previously featured a heated verbal exchange between Jose Aldo and Frankie Edgar as they faced each other in a featherweight matchup.

Rome has long been considered one of MMA's great cities. Its Coliseum hosts UFC's first and second events of each year, so if you can only go to one venue, it's a good bet this is the one to visit.

"The UFC is the most popular sport in Brazil," says Anderson Silva. "To see a Brazilian fighter beat a foreigner on Brazilian soil was great for us."

In May, UFC president Dana White said that he would consider bringing a UFC card to Miami, perhaps as early as 2014.

The UFC has made numerous international expansion moves recently, including holding three events in the U.K., with many more planned.

But the big question is how many cards will the UFC have in Brazil by 2014? Could they host two cards there next year?

"That's the talk," Silva said. "You have to win so many times at the same place and the same market. Brazil is an international market. We have no foreign fighters, and a lot of the people who are watching the event on TV are not Brazilians. It's the same for the U.K., where a lot of people are watching our event. That's something we want to do.

"It's so much more important to do events at home. In Brazil, they don't understand the other markets. That's why I think we need to create more events. And who knows? Maybe in 2014, we'll do two cards in Brazil."

It took six minutes, 30 seconds for Jose Aldo to stop Katsunori Kikuno at UFC 142.

Aldo was on a rampage before UFC 142, going 5-1 over a seven-month stretch that included a first-round knockout over Mark Hominick and a decisive win over Gray Maynard that earned him the interim UFC featherweight title. The last fight in that stretch was a unanimous decision over Chan Sung Jung at UFC 138 in November, a fight that Aldo won without a strike being thrown.

"One more fight at home and I'm ready to fight for the belt," said Aldo, who will defend his interim UFC featherweight title in the co-main event against Cub Swanson at UFC on Fox 7 in August.

So how does Aldo find the motivation to fight if it doesn't end in knockouts?

"You know the saying, 'It ain't over till it's over?' I keep going back to that in my head," he said. "It ain't over. I haven't done everything, but I haven't done nothing. It's never over. You can have a bad fight, but there's no quit in me. I keep going until the end, until the fight is over. That's one of my things in life. That's why I love MMA."

"I will make a lot of money in one night with the title, but my motivation is in fighting for it," he continued. "The belt makes me want to go forward. I can't get caught up in the money or just winning for the sake of winning. I have to stay humble. I don't want to make a show for money, I want to make a show to improve my image. My image needs to be solid now."

When he was a junior in high school in Brazil, Edilberto de Jesus was in a schoolyard fight and got stabbed in the shoulder.

His injury sidelined him for the rest of the year. When he got back on the mat, he was no longer a fighter. He was a coach.

"This is where I really learned about jiu-jitsu," he said.

Now, Edilberto is 13-1 and currently signed to fight in the welterweight division in the Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 2.

It has only been a couple of years since Edilberto got back on the mat, but the Brazilian says he feels like a changed man.

"The best thing about jiu-jitsu is that it makes you better mentally and physically," he said. "When you get back into fighting, you're a different person. Mentally, you get to see how you have grown.

"You have to be disciplined with jiu-jitsu. You can't just have a good time. You have to take jiu-jitsu seriously and treat it like a business. You have to treat it like a business. Otherwise, you'll get burned out."
