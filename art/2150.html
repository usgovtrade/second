Despite this, the band continued performing and recording, and released several other albums on their independent label, with the help of friends.

In 2002, the band released their debut album, titled My Dead World. This album is a collection of cover songs, of which many were not originally released, and the band does not take credit for the covers.

On February 11, 2005, the band released their second album, titled Unfun.  The album is considered a full-length tribute to the Grateful Dead, specifically as seen from the perspective of the songs from Aoxomoxoa. According to band member Sean O'Connor, this album was intended as a tribute to the first Grateful Dead album from 1968: Anthem of the Sun, calling it "one of the most important music albums of all time."
