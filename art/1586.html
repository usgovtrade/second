A new study by researchers at Cambridge University has predicted that by 2050, 80 percent of the tasks performed by humans in the home could be replaced by artificial intelligence. The experts believe the tasks AI is good at include cooking, cleaning, and maintaining the home.

AI For The Masses

What we're seeing is a sort of revolution of the way consumers purchase things. A.I. is in its infancy but has the potential to be so impactful. These companies are now offering an array of services and services and offering them as an all-encompassing "one-stop shop." As an example, some of the best known examples are Google and Amazon, which are using AI to provide personalized information for people.

The Bottom Line

Our research shows A.I. is already having a tremendous impact on the services that consumers receive, and it's just the beginning. The more that A.I.s are used by companies, the more they'll become ingrained in all aspects of our lives, including the way we order food.

How AI can change the way we go out to eat

The technology of AI is already being used to make our online grocery shopping easier, and with A.I.s in restaurants and cafes already, how will they impact the way you go out to eat?

AI For The Masses

One of the largest industries that AI will affect in the future is travel. In 2020, we will see autonomous cars hitting the roads, and it is predicted that by 2030, 50 percent of taxi rides will be taken by an autonomous vehicle. With more tech companies looking to introduce this new system to consumers, the demand for ridesharing will go up as well.

Food Delivery

The same goes for food delivery, with Amazon recently announcing that it would be testing delivery robots. The future of food delivery will likely be all about apps and a seamless way to receive your meals. That way you don't have to go out and stand in a long queue in the cold or heat. With Google, they've come up with a prototype called Project Wing, which is a self-flying quadcopter. The company has already tested this out in Australia and have delivered pizzas and sandwiches.

It's not just food delivery though. It's about getting the food to the person at the right time, at the right time. If you order takeout from a restaurant online, it's going to be delivered at your doorstep. That can cut out any waiting time and allow people to get to the restaurant quicker so they can enjoy their meal with friends. For restaurants, this could mean improved efficiency and business. It could also mean more revenue for the restaurants since people don't have to wait in line. The future of food delivery is already here.

The Bottom Line

The future of the way you go out to eat is already here. For most restaurants, the business model isn't really as much about the food as it is about the experience. You may order the same dish at various restaurants, but how you receive your food will be the difference maker, and the technology will be behind this. One of the best examples is the food delivery service GrubHub. GrubHub allows users to schedule, track, and pay for their delivery in one place. It works seamlessly across the United States, in both the food delivery and takeout world.

A.I. Technology In The Air

As you wait for your food to arrive from your favorite local restaurant, which will likely be A.I.-based, think of what you use on a regular basis. How often do you use Spotify? Netflix? Netflix wants you to know it's working on an A.I. system that recognizes and recommends more of your favorite movies and shows in response to what you watch, similar to the way Apple Music does it.

The Bottom Line

To get your food from your restaurant, place or even your car into your mouth, is an A.I.-powered future. To receive your food or delivery is the A.I. technology for the masses, and the convenience is great. It's about getting people into the restaurant faster, taking out the long lines and busy work, while simultaneously improving the food delivery process and allowing restaurants to deliver more quickly.

A.I. Technology And The Hospitality Industry

As we move into a world where robots and A.I. play a major role in our daily lives, some of these technologies could also play a part in the hospitality industry. It has been predicted that restaurants, hotels, and hotels in particular, will go through a large amount of change in the coming years.

A.I. For The Restaurant

The reason for this is a large number of jobs being created, with an increased demand for restaurant services. Already, machines can be used to take orders for a restaurant, with payment coming straight from the person's card. For the waitstaff, it's all about how fast they can prepare a meal, and serve it to the customer. With A.I., this becomes possible. One restaurant in Spain has already introduced robots that are used to cook meals for customers, allowing people to sit back, enjoy a drink, and watch their food being prepared.

The Bottom Line

With robots being used for work in the restaurant, the wait staff is now more focused on interaction with customers and delivering great service. They are also focusing on the food preparation and how to improve the dining experience. You can expect to see this become a lot more commonplace in restaurants over the next few years.

AI For The Hotel

In the hotel industry, there is a lot of work to be done. According to research published in August 2016, "it's predicted that the number of hotel rooms will triple by 2025 and fourfold by 2030 as the middle class expands in emerging economies." That's quite a leap in growth for this industry. There will be huge demand for accommodation and that means there will be plenty of room for more efficient A.I.-powered experiences to be developed.

AI For The Hotel Industry

AI can take care of some of the most tedious aspects of hotel management. The technology can be used to check guests in, check them out, book them a room, and even prepare the meal in the kitchen.

The Bottom Line

By using A.I., hotels can save a lot of money on labor and human employees. There are all kinds of possibilities here. It could be robots to replace room cleaners, who are some of the highest paid employees in the hotel industry. They could also have a huge impact on what happens to housekeeping in the future, and we could even see people taking up some of the jobs that housekeepers do. But this technology is also great for booking and getting reservations for rooms, and even making sure you get a good deal for staying at a hotel</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:11
