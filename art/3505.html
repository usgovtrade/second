The thesis focused on the relationship between the angle at which a BHS rider sits on his horse and the angle at which a rider's feet are located in relation to his or her hips and knees.  The analysis indicated that riders who straddled the saddle and sat at an angle of approximately 40 degrees tended to be the best performers. The results of the investigation led to several practical applications.

After graduation, Dr. Hovorka continued to serve as a full-time consultant for the BHS, while working towards a PhD in kinesiology and an MA in education.  Dr. Hovorka earned her PhD at the University of Utah and was hired as the director of the Utah National Finals Rodeo (UNFR) rodeo research project.  A large-scale study, funded by the National Rodeo Association, was carried out at UNFR in 2002-2005, with Dr. Hovorka collecting data in the gymnasium using various motion capture technology devices.  The study identified the physical characteristics of the best roping, saddle bronc, bareback riding, steer wrestling, bull riding, and barrel racing competitors, among others.

While serving as a professor and chair of the Department of Kinesiology at BYU, Dr. Hovorka served as the associate dean for research and graduate studies from 1998 to 2004, after which she was hired as the dean of the College of Health and Human Performance. Dr. Hovorka has been heavily involved with the BYU Women's Center, working as a keynote speaker at the organization's luncheons and events. In 2015, she was the keynote speaker at the annual Women's Recognition Ceremony.  

While chair of the department at BYU, Dr. Hovorka served on several committees, including a five-year term on the NCAA Woman's Council. Dr. Hovorka remains on the committee and continues to act as a consultant for the organization, currently with her name on two large grants through the NCAA. She has been credited for her work with gender equity in sport, as well as her "exceptional service and service leadership."

Dr. Hovorka continues to serve as a keynote speaker at many events, including the National Strength & Conditioning Association's 2018 International Conference and Expo, the World Team Tennis organization's Grand Prix, the Salt Lake City Sports Commission and the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Women's Rider Convention. She also serves on several advisory boards for national organizations, including the NCAA Women's Golf Division I Leadership Council, International Federation of Roller Sports (IFRS) executive committee, National Women's Hall of Fame, as well as the NCAA women's lacrosse committee and the Women's National Basketball League (WNBA). She has also been honored with awards for her athletic achievements.
