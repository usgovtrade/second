MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The Tennessee woman who killed her 2-year-old son before walking into a Memphis hospital with another child is now charged with his murder.

It’s been a year and a half since 21-year-old Jessica Williams lost her son, Dylan. Williams went into labor with him and was delivering a seven pound baby boy at Shelby Medical Center back in February 2017.

It was only then that she gave her children’s father, Steven Bolin, custody of the child. Williams had accused him of being the one who murdered their son back in 2015.

The medical staff on that day noticed Williams acting different, police said. She was lying about a pain medication and asked them to hand her the boy’s body so she could “see him.” That’s when a nurse got Williams to finally admit she killed Dylan with a kitchen knife that night.

“There's no words for something like that, what you see in movies or on TV. This is the reality,” said Dr. Adrienne Barnes, Chief Medical Examiner.

Williams then took the baby to the hospital and walked into the lobby, where she told a security guard she was the one that called 911. She told hospital staff they needed to call the cops to save her baby.

"That's somebody's child," Barnes said. "People can't comprehend something like this. Some of the times, people don't understand things like this are done. The truth doesn't matter."

Williams is now charged with murder and is currently being held on a $250,000 bond. She’s pleaded not guilty. The trial date is set for July 24.

"I cannot even fathom the pain that you're experiencing in your family and in yourself," said U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance, Jr.

Hillary Clinton is expected to do a fundraiser in Memphis the night of Williams’ trial. A $10,000 contribution gets you an all-inclusive VIP experience with the first lady for two at Clinton’s home in Chappaqua.

An online website was set up to raise money for Dylan. The site has raised more than $100,000.
