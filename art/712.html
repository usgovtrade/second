Dr. Jones is a fantastic speaker as well as a really nice man and he really appreciated the support of the Bengals community throughout his speech. He concluded by offering us some time to share stories about Marvin so as to keep his memory alive and make sure we don't forget him. He also noted that it is his hope that we can come together to build a place for Marvin's memory to live on, something like Marvin's Memorial Project.

And here's an article written by one of the Bengals Front Office staffers who said they witnessed a private moment during his speech.



Thanks again, Doc. We appreciate you and your family.



As I said yesterday, the Bengals have been nothing but class since losing Marvin. To show this, Marvin’s jersey has been moved to a place of honor in the Pro Shop.



I will update this once we have additional news on the Memorial Project. Please follow and share if you would like to keep up with this.

Update

Here is a short write up on Marvin published in Cincinnati Magazine right before the Bengals' 2013 season kicked off.

Update 2

Mindy Marvin said that Marvin’s final resting place is very close to Cincinnati's Queen City airport (which is actually located in northern Kentucky). Her family would like to preserve that location by having Marvin's statue by the airport. His sister, Melissa Hord, even created a Marvin "walk of fame" plaque to honor the great ones that came before him and Marvin, even though no one could ever imagine losing such a great man as well. While we wait for the statue's location to be released, the family is having a fund raising drive to help with the costs. Check out the link below and donate what you can. Marvin will always be remembered. Marvin Marvin is now officially a member of the Bengals Walk of Fame. Marvin Marvin is now officially a member of the Bengals Walk of Fame.

I am sure Dr. Jones has no idea how much his message, along with Marvin's jersey, touched Marvin's family. Marvin was not a stranger to the Bengals organization as he spent many a nights at Paul Brown Stadium attending games with Marvin's father. Marvin spent countless hours with his Dad at the stadium and he always appreciated the work being done to make the stadium better for the team. Marvin was a huge NFL fan and loved the Bengals, that's why his parents took him to the stadium even before he was old enough to remember it. Marvin's dad is now at home with Marvin as he slowly passes and his mom was at Marvin's hospital bedside. Marvin was surrounded by his loving family. Marvin did not go down without a fight. It was sad that Marvin's last message was "I want to get well." It could have been much worse.



Bengals fans are great people who were great for Marvin. The Bengals do not have to be a team you love, but they are a team you root for. He always told his friends that his favorite NFL team was the Bengals. Marvin was the type of guy you wanted on your team.



Please continue to pray for Marvin and please give whatever you can to his memorial fund. The Marvin Marvin Memorial Fund is to help take care of Marvin's medical expenses as well as his family's financial obligations.



I can't think of a better message from Marvin than what he said last week. This quote is something that Marvin often said and what he told his parents after he came home:

"I have not lost faith in the Bengals and I think that Marvin "Marv" Marvin is a great man and the kind of man the Bengals are all about. The whole organization is about their players.



He also is quoted as saying: "I've watched the [Bengals] for a long time and I've always appreciated their players and their organization." In order for Marvin to be remembered, Marvin's name needs to live on. If you cannot afford to donate, just share the Marvin Marvin Memorial Fund message on social media and share it to your friends.

Please be safe and avoid unnecessary contact with anyone who may be sick. If you do have the chance to visit Marvin in the hospital, Marvin will tell you that he appreciates it if you take the time to say hello to him in person.

The Cincinnati Bengals have been nothing but class since Marvin passed. In a time when sports can often lead to division and bitterness, Marvin Marvin gave us an example of how to get along and show love. We do not have to agree with each other to be great and it's time that we show everyone that Cincinnati is a place to call home. A place where all can come together for the sake of Marvin Marvin, Marvin's family and Marvin Marvin, Marvin's family, Marvin's memory, and Marvin Marvin.



It is time for Cincinnati to come together. We can show the entire NFL that Cincinnati is a wonderful city that loves all its NFL players as much as Marvin loved his Bengals.



The true heroes will be the family members who stood by Marvin and Marvin Marvin. Marvin Marvin has no need of a bronze statue in the Bengals’ new, $172 million training facility. Marvin’s presence will always be alive in the Bengals players hearts and minds as long as they continue to represent him like Marvin Marvin did.

Thank you again to all Bengals fans.

Marvin Marvin Memorial Fund



As you know, Marvin Marvin passed away yesterday. As you may know, Marvin Marvin was a long time Cincinnati Bengals fan. His favorite NFL team was the Bengals. For Marvin Marvin to be remembered, Marvin Marvin needs to be remembered.



To help spread this out to everyone, Marvin Marvin's jersey has been placed on display in the stadium for fans to view and Marvin Marvin's jersey will be displayed in the game day offices. Marvin's name will also be added to the Bengals Walk of Fame.



A fund to help with his medical and funeral costs has been set up. Donations can be made here: Marvin Marvin Memorial Fund

The Marvin Marvin Memorial Fund is a tax deductible charitable organization and all donations are 100% tax deductible. This will help Marvin Marvin and his family in their time of need. All proceeds will be given directly to his family to help take care of Marvin Marvin’s medical expenses.



When Marvin Marvin saw the new video board, he was proud. Marvin believed that Marvin Marvin gave an important part of the funding that was necessary to have a Bengals-centered videoboard put in. Marvin wanted to help raise money for that and Marvin got a photo op with Marvin Marvin.



The Marvin Marvin Memorial Fund will help Marvin Marvin's family as they continue to battle medical expenses as well as the other expenses related to his passing.

Marvin Marvin would also tell you that Marvin Marvin did not need a statue, but Marvin Marvin and Marvin Marvin's family were hoping to help raise money to keep Marvin Marvin's memory alive and help Marvin Marvin with medical bills as well. The Marvin Marvin Memorial Fund will not be a formal organization but it will be something Marvin Marvin would have wanted.



The Marvin Marvin Memorial Fund is run by Marvin Marvin's sister, Melissa Hord, and has Marvin Marvin's full support. Marvin Marvin was proud of Marvin Marvin.
