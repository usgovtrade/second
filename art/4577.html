The reason I went for the E-mags was because I could just keep plugging them into the magazines of other guns, where I could add more shells if it was needed, and I didn't need to keep lugging around more than 2 or 3 of those high-end magazines on a mule hunt.

Yeah and if you hit yourself with the mag you still have 8 mags! I think you are looking at this the wrong way. You have your magazines filled with a certain amount of rounds, maybe 10 for every gun. So you may have a grand total of 200 rounds per mag. Now if you run out of ammo, or for some odd reason you can't get to that extra magazine you went and brought because your mule decided to roll on it, you can't refill it until your mag refills. So it all depends on how much ammo you brought for each weapon.

Well I was thinking I would buy 5 of those cheap low end mags so i could always have more rounds on hand, and the extra mags could go on a truck or gun carrier, and come to camp with us. When this was all explained to me, I could immediately see how it made more sense to get the E-mags.

I could have also gone with some 50 rounders, but would need a huge amount of ammo for them too. Either way, with my limited knowledge, I still think the E-mags will provide the higher number of rounds, and be easier to carry. Also, I think the E-mags have a larger capacity than the old style mags.

I went with the mag-locks and got the 15 rounders. When you have to travel as far as I do, I am looking to save weight and space. That is why I need these mags to pack more rounds for my longer trips. To keep it simple, for these scenarios, I am giving myself 4 of the 15 rounders to start with. I hope they hold enough for the long trips I take.

I just went out and bought a new mag with 500 rounds in it at Cabelas. I think these will work well, since I'll need them most on the long hunt out west. I don't plan on buying any more of the E-mag clips, since I'm using some reloading equipment I already have that I can use to put more rounds in them.

I have no doubts that my rifle will make any gun sound silly.

It's the one constant in life, some are born for greatness and for others greatness is

I have a S&W M&P 15/22 with 4 mags. I got about 60 rounds in each.
I loaded 2 mags full of .22g for the trip to Kansas for deer season with
my S&W M&P 15/22 with 4 mags. I reloaded the other 2 with 55 grain .22LR.

It is a very good round.

I've found that the .22LR is as accurate as a varmint rifle.
That said, it might still be worth the weight to get a lighter rifle to help.
Especially if you want to make the climb/scramble up on your way to the ridge

I'm probably going to go get some E-mags just because I'm planning on going on several mule hunts for deer later this year. I'll only have about 200-250 rounds per gun, and I won't be reloading that much. It will only take a few minutes to swap mags from one gun to the next and I don't want to have to carry another 60 rounds around my body. For now I'm ok with just having the E-mags for this summer, but I may buy a few more later if I decide to continue doing mule hunting in the future.

"I don't understand how one guy can put that much more effort into typing on a internet forum than he did in putting together that rifle!"

I think one can make the most out of any caliber when one learns to hunt them. I use a Remington 7mm mag when I hunt and can hit small game as well as larger species with little effort.

Mule hunting is really a simple task that can get you some great action shots with a quality rifle, I think the one piece is the ammo you need.

If I remember correctly, when the Winchester round was made, they used the .220, but it was too harsh and hard on a soft animal, so they ended up creating the .222 and even that is hot enough to tear your arm out.

They made a .223 round with a soft point and a steel core that is used today for target shooting and some plinking, you can find more ammo for less money as well. You could also look into the .22/5.56 which has similar qualities. If you need something more powerful, the 223-6.8, the 308, etc. are all popular rounds to shoot for long range shooting and the AR15/M-16 round.

I agree that the .223 round has a tendency to burn when it comes into contact with the animal. The one that is typically used in mule deer hunting is .308, it is a bit more expensive but still goes far.

The reason I went for the E-mags was because I could just keep plugging them into the magazines of other guns, where I could add more shells if it was needed, and I didn't need to keep lugging around more than 2 or 3 of those high-end magazines on a mule hunt.

I still feel like the old .270s of today are much more pleasant to carry.

I agree with the .308's, but it is hard to beat the quality and price on the .223, I'm thinking of getting another rifle for deer and coyote next year. I plan on getting a Remington .223 or Winchester Defender.

I like the idea of the mags because I don't want to have to worry about my rifle running out of ammo while I'm on the hunt. With a lot of longer range animals around here, you can get some long shots if you take your time, so I would like to have as many bullets as possible. With 3 mags for a big rifle like an M1A or an M14, I'll always be worried about not having enough ammo for a shot.

A lot of the guys I go out with are a bit older than me, and they seem to prefer the Remington. Most of them get more ammo than I do, but they're older than me so they can't walk as fast as me (I have a big truck so I can run!). If it has good velocity, I like it. They say it's the best rifle I've ever shot!

The good thing about the Remington is that it fits a lot of things. They make the Defender, the M700, the 700 Magnum, and I think that's about it. I'll be getting one for sure. It is good to have as many different bullets as you can so you can practice. Like the S&W, they also make the 100-shot box and the 1,000-shot box!

The S&W is a popular one for deer hunting, I've seen them online for cheaper than most rifle for a lot more than mine.

My brother has an AK-74, and he uses the Remington .223 with 168 grain bullets. They also have a lot of good bullets for the AK. The .223 will actually be the round of choice for it since it fits the bullet diameter of the AK. He told me that he actually shoots the .223 better than the 7.62X</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:46
