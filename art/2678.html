"The survivor wins!" "We are a team." "We are the mighty, mighty Titans." "Aces high, nines and eights." "Kings of the jungle!" "You're gonna be a sorry excuse for a man if you don't put that club down." "So what if I don't?" "Oh, no!" "You better put it down." "Cause there's a peeping tom in your garden, and he's a blood-sucking mosquito." "Look, little old lady." "I don't know what your problem is." "But i'm gonna take my gun and put it up the old ass." "And I'm gonna blow his natural born vampire fucking heart." "I'm not gonna let you do it." "I'm gonna make you look." "Right in the eye." "And tell you what you're going to do." "A human of your kind is very seldom seen in my village." "I mean, I can see that you're dangerous." "But this is my garden." "We all try to help each other." "It's really your fault." "Now, why don't you just leave?" "Oh, i'm the one that says, no." "Now i'll get you a little close-up of how you're gonna go." "I'm sorry." "Well, it's still a pretty good shot." "Go ahead and use that." "Just save it for me!" "Okay, I can see how your wife feels about it." "Let's do it your way." "Get a little closer." "Titan Titans!" "It's not easy to get the drop on a Titan but I'm a clever little old fella." "Titan Titans!" "Not all men can keep their woman." "But I sure as hell can." "But now." "If you let go of this." "You're gonna get your ass stomped." "You don't understand anything." "I don't want to talk about this any more." "I'm going to bed." "How do you like my new club?" "It ain't big but I like you, old man." "Oh, thanks." "I'll bet you like it." "It just goes on like that for three, four minutes." "Pretty good, huh?" "How did you do that?" "That was like a high." "The only two people in the world who knew were the two of us and now nobody knows, not even the old man." "You're wonderful!" "You're wonderful!" "I'll get something to eat and then I'll be right back." "All right, it's all yours." "You'll take them to the other side of the jungle and you'll give them my little present." "Titan Titans!" "Don't go outside of your boundary, old man." "Hey, I know." "Why don't we do it the jungle way." "Huh?" "We'll put the club in the middle of the river and when they come, i'll pop out and say:" "Survivor warfare, you know?" "Yeah!" "Yeah!" "What's this?" "What's this?" "No!" "I guess, i'm coming down, honey." "What are you doing, trying to be funny?" "No." "I'm just feeling sorry for you." "My momma told me that when you do that, and the bad boy come in, you get pregnant." "Come on, now." "I ain't even had my last beer yet." "You're all right." "I don't know about that." "What's wrong?" "Well, you told me that you loved me, but you're a different person when you're drinking." "You talk like you're not gonna be around too long, and that bothers me." "Oh, please!" "Wait!" "Why don't you get your hands off me, man!" "Shut up!" "Stop it!" "Just stop it." "Just stop it." "What are you doing?" "Stop it!" "Get outta here!" "I ought to get so much money for that." "I'm sorry." "All right, let's go home." "Did you ever notice, all the young guys have a big mouth, they're just stupid." "Like to show off." "Oh, they're just stupid and vain and I hate them." "I hate everything about them." "But when they leave, they go away and then they die." "They die and they die and they never, never come back again." "Are you going to leave me?" "No." "Not ever?" "Not ever." "You won't die?" "No." "Not me, honey." "Not ever." "Maybe not today or tomorrow or in a thousand years but someday." "I will see you again." "Yeah." "Oh, here." "Your favourite." "I put the good roast on for you." "You know, this morning I went to buy a chicken." "The butcher asked me if I wanted a live one or a dead one." "That was the last time I laughed." "I guess this is the end of the road." "I ain't much for saying goodbye." "But I ain't got nothing left to say to you either." "Goodbye, my darling." "Goodbye, my love." "Your body is just as beautiful as it was the day we met, not a line, not a wrinkle, no grey hairs at all." "I'm gonna get you!" "Who do you think you are?" "Why don't you just stay in your own little world and shut up!" "I just don't wanna see any more killing around here." "That's what you don't want." "All you do is make these innocent girls suffer." "I know your kind, mister." "You've already got the gun, haven't you?" "I mean, if it had to be done, why not just get it over with?" "You want to have a big showdown in the middle of the streets." "And why?" "What's it going to accomplish?" "Huh?" "Huh?" "Nothing!" "Well, now, old man, let me tell you something." "You want to go outside and take this stuff back to the club." "Because if you do, you're gonna find that this gun is loaded with dynamite, mister." "That's all right." "I'll be back soon." "You just leave your weapons out here on the table and I'll get them." "Just shut up!" "Bastard!" "Bastard!" "Crawl back in your cage, you filthy dog." "Come on!" "You have it your own way, Mister." "Doorbell." "Coming." "Hi." "Good morning, honey." "How are you?" "Did you sleep well?" "I did." "I did." "Look what I found on the floor of the front porch." "Oh, is that right?" "Yes." "Well, you know what?" "I had a dream last night that your head just came off in my hands." "Then I cut off your arms and your legs and threw them in the river." "Oh, my God, I'm sorry, sweetheart, it's just an old rag." "I'm sorry." "I was gonna put it up on the wall over the fireplace." "I swear, I'll be careful with it." "Let me put it in the bathroom and soak it." "Do you mind if I lie down for a while?" "Oh, no, of course not." "I'm still kind of weak from the operation." "It's an amazing improvement." "Can I have some coffee, please?" "Oh, honey, are you sure you don't wanna play a little more before you go?" "I don't know." "I'm kind of tired." "You know what I'd really like to do?" "I'd really like to go to the country and have a couple of drinks and look at some waterfalls." "There's one around here I'd like you to see." "It's not too far from here." "Well, come on, let's go." "You really don't have to, you know, baby." "Please do." "I love you." "You don't know how much." "What happened to your hands?" "Nothing." "What happened?" "Nothing." "Well, the right one's swollen all out of proportion." "I got a terrible headache and I've been vomiting all night." "Well, what's wrong?" "You don't look like yourself today." "Really?" "I must look awful." "You look nice to me." "I like you." "You're a real nice woman." "Well, what is it?" "What's wrong?" "I don't know." "You got something you want to talk about?" "No, I guess not." "I'll be waiting right here for you if you decide to come back, okay?" "Promise?" "I'll be back." "I think I'm going to enjoy you so much today, baby." "Are you sure you don't want to run away with me?" "Yeah, I'm sure." "I want to stay and see you again." "Well, you're probably the only person that wouldn't run away from me today." "What's the matter?" "Don't you like me anymore?" "Hey, baby, you better get dressed and go out of here." "And don't</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:53
