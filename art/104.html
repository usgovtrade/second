Mary, this is what I think the deal is.  I didn't pull up the aga sheet to 
make sure.  Please make sure I'm right.  

Janet and I left a little note about it at the bottom of the aga sheet on 
Friday.

Gary is paying out every other day, so the two deal numbers below are on the 
one day that we have to pay it.


152496   10,750mmbtu/d @ $4.65
152497   10,750mmbtu/d @ $4.66


We are only paying the demand charge.  The commodity cost is coming out of 
our rate charge.  

We only have one deal on the aga.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Thanks

I am a Texas Trails agent.  Trailblazer has informed me that at the beginning 
of March, several issues with meter # 1541 occurred.  As a result of these 
issues, meter flow went to "Alert" status.  This meter issues confirmed 
activity on several days from the first of March through the 15th.  There 
were days in which the volume flowed that far exceeded the number of 
receipts/deliveries recorded in Aga.  Some of the days are shown below.  
Please note, these are just samples of the days that we have data for.



 

These are the days that we received a violation letter from Trailblazer.  The 
consolidated violation letter is in Noel's mail.

I am also looking at a couple of production invoices that are due in 3/31 and 
4/7/00.  I will forward them to you when I receive them.

Please give me a call when you have a chance and we can discuss any questions 
that you may have.

Thanks,
Brenda

Please set up 1 more contract for meter # 1541.  This deal is on a purchase 
deal and Trailblazer, with Chris's help, has informed me that they received 
flow on several days for this meter that exceed the number of receipts 
recorded in aga.  They are now going to be issuing violation letters.  The 
days are shown below.  I am not certain that I have a contract for the days 
in which we received the excess flow.



Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Brenda</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:07
