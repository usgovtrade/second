How to Make Money as a Developer Without Needing a Degree - vimarshk

It's possible that most of these folks would have found the same path had they
been lucky enough to have attended one of the major tech schools, but instead
the deck was stacked against them because they didn't.

Some folks are just better off if the barriers to entry were higher for them.
That's fine, but it means they're playing a zero-sum game where more good
people can't win by doing what they do.

Just as long as you're working for a startup, you can always find a job with
the company that pays you enough to live. Just my opinion, but someone with a
$30k paycheck and no degree is far more likely to stay in a job longer
(because you can't just quit/get fired because of financial reasons).

My friend quit his well-paid programming job when he started a family and has
made some bad choices in the past few years. He is now making minimum wage at
a company that doesn't pay overtime (which isn't fair, but I guess that's
better than nothing).

No, that's not always the case; companies do sometimes go bankrupt, go out of
business, etc. Or they fire half their staff. Then, without benefits or
seniority, how does a lesser-paid person find another job? Even if the market
isn't saturated with senior folks who were laid off or fired? Isn't it risky
to bet your entire career on a single company? And isn't it possible that a
company you rely on for your livelihood could go bankrupt?

Or they just lay off half their staff.

I see this as kind of a problem with a lot of people looking for financial
success. They just don't want to work hard enough. In reality it comes down to
"hard work is the best shortcut to financial success", you have to hustle to
be successful, but if you have the perseverance and discipline, it doesn't
have to be some kind of marathon, it doesn't have to be "9-5 job" work. I work
a lot, but not every single day, and when I'm having a day off, I'm usually
working on my side projects or learning something new.

It helps a lot if your goal isn't to "make money" though. If your goal is to
"make $X in the next 3 years", that's something that takes a lot of effort to
just make happen and I wouldn't personally use my savings and risk spending
time off doing something like that.

If your goal is to buy a nice car and house, "work hard" is basically "find a
job where you can do 8hrs a day for $15/hr and do it consistently". Of course
that's not how the game is played, but many people who think they want to
"make money" don't realize that's how the game is played. They want "X",
wherever "X" is, but most people aren't willing to put in the hours to get it.

It sounds like he is saying this is no way to make money. The only way to do
that is build multiple startups. The idea that most people don't have any
choice to build multiple startups because they need money is simply false.

It sounds like this is why he's complaining about the lack of passion, etc. He
is saying if everyone just stops complaining and quit complaining and really
tried they could make great startups. It's not realistic to expect that you
can spend your time on something else. My parents raised a family and didn't
get a degree. They got one after I left the house. Why? Because it was there
and people did it. It's a choice. This should be obvious.

I think the reason startups fail is because people put up with so much bullshit
from big corporations that when they come out with a successful startup people
just say "wow, they actually have a good idea" and jump onboard. Or they do
it, but then don't have the passion and they don't try to improve on the idea
over time and it just fades away. And I know this because my parents were
there and so were all of my older family members that I knew. They all owned
their own businesses that they ran into the ground. That's why they're no
longer with us. It's not the "passionate hard workers" it's just a broken
startup process that needs to be fixed.

The article is not from the guy who made Dropsend and he's just explaining his
startup. No sense in assuming that all "most people" means is the OP.

I agree with your sentiment, most startup founders are a little delusional and
unfocused. But I don't think that's a bad thing.

You're not going to make your first successful startup if you can't focus and
deliver a product that does what you said. I've seen it with my own eyes and
as a founder.

But that's OK, because it's a very easy problem to solve. But you have to want
it enough.

The guy who made Dropsend is also the one who made a series of products to
generate leads for his first startup so he could pay for more courses to get
his degree. He did not make his first startup first. Dropsend came _years_
after he had a degree and years before he had a great idea for his startup. He
had a job while in college that he built into a good income and that has
sustained him through the years. He also didn't get his first startup off the
ground and then work on another one. This is a very common pattern. People who
get good degrees without knowing how to make money, then try to build multiple
startups, before they know how to build one successful business. All of this
is because of their attitude. They have no idea about the process. They just
have this naive view that it's easy to figure it all out. And I don't blame
them for believing that. But the truth is you need to be aware that the game
isn't easy. So you have to be realistic and understand the process.

The guy who made Dropsend may have gone through something similar, but I'm not
him and I can't speak on his personal business.

I know it's _possible_ to make a successful startup without the usual degree.
I know it's possible to make a successful startup without an education in CS.
I know it's possible to build a successful startup without even starting a
business in your life (I started working in business at 16 with no degree and
built a multi-million dollar business by 27).

The reason I have a degree is that I was very serious about it. I was trying
to do something. I was going to get a degree no matter what. It did suck in
many ways, but it was important.

I do recommend that people get an education. I just suggest that it is better
to view your education as preparation for the real world. I could write a book
about my early 20's and how I did it all wrong and had to learn my lesson the
hard way and now know how to do it all right. But this isn't HN.

You are getting down voted. It’s hard to hear people arguing about what people
should do with their time. If you have to spend so much time convincing people
not to do something, then you aren’t talking about a topic you want people to
take seriously. So I’ll bow out and let you get on with your day. I’m sure
you’ll find better uses of your time than convincing me of the errors of my
ways. Thanks.
