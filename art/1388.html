The award-winning organization also announced its commitment to continue Operation Welcome Home for another six months. As a result, Operation Welcome Home will run through May 2011 in seven U.S. cities.

The mission of Operation Welcome Home is to help ensure that all veterans have a home in their new community. The program matches each veteran with a sponsor or mentor from the community, helping the veteran integrate into the community and making connections to build a support system of friends, neighbors and community members.

Operation Welcome Home works in conjunction with another veterans' organization, the National Guard Association of Pennsylvania, which provides military-specific mentorship and networking opportunities to the approximately 1,000 Guard members who transition to the civilian world every year.

Operation Welcome Home believes that all veterans should have a home in the community where they live. In times of war, it is easy to forget that all people are made equally valuable by their Creator and should be treated with dignity and respect.

It's in that context that Operation Welcome Home is committed to helping all veterans transition successfully back to civilian life. As Americans prepare to celebrate Independence Day, it is important that we take time to pause, remember, and give thanks for the men and women who courageously serve in our military.

Operation Welcome Home is a national non-profit organization dedicated to helping veterans succeed as civilians. We are a volunteer-based network of members from all walks of life who are committed to providing a strong network of support to help veterans transition successfully from military life to civilian life.

Operation Welcome Home began in 2009 as a partnership between a local veterans group and a local homeless shelter, which served as the pilot program for the rest of the nation. Our program has expanded to 17 cities and helped more than 1,000 homeless and at-risk veterans each year.

Our program will focus on helping veterans who live at the street level in low income areas. We provide each participant with a mentor who is a civilian connected to the community. We will match each veteran with someone who is more than willing to take the time to support them by providing a warm handshake, a kind word or even an umbrella on a rainy day. Our volunteers meet with our veterans at least once a week in our home to eat meals together and discuss our day-to-day challenges and successes.

The goal of Operation Welcome Home is to help veterans return to civilian life and not become a repeat of the homeless veteran, a subject all too familiar to many Americans. We hope that with our help, our veterans will succeed.

Operation Welcome Home is a Veterans organization dedicated to the re-entry of the most disadvantaged of our military community; our Veterans who have been injured and have been discharged; to help them with the transition of their experiences.
