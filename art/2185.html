"All right, I'll be right there." "What happened?" "We came here to play a game." "Let's just do that." "You okay?" "Not really." "Yeah, I'm okay." "You should get that looked at." "Yeah." "It's fine." "I'm gonna be right back." "Just play the game." "Please play the game." "Please play the game." "I can't stand it any longer." "No!" "Please!" "Please play the game!" "Warfare has begun." "And this time, our teams were a lot closer in skill level." "Cowboy made sure we kicked off with our first clue." "In that hole there." "In, boy!" "Let's do this!" "Let's play Survivor!" "It's the best way to learn the game." "And let me tell you, it has been a long day." "That's what I'm talking about." "That was the best way to learn the game." "So now, after this long day of walking, let's get back to the game." "Get back out there." "Let's play Survivor." "You're going the wrong way!" "It's a good sign, Cowboy." "This is gonna be fun!" "Well, it's been a long day." "And this long day has been filled with one of the most frustrating experiences" "I've ever had playing a game in my entire life." "You know what?" "I don't care." "It's gonna get better." "I don't care how long it takes." "This is stupid!" "I'm not doing it, bro!" "He's gonna kill himself out there!" "The game can wait." "Just get him some hot chocolate and sit him down." "No, it can't." "It has to go on." "I'm gonna find another clue!" "I'm gonna find another clue!" "You're never gonna find the other clue." "What the hell is he doing out there?" "He has a map." "Where did it say there was another clue?" "Every 10 miles, there was another clue." "Well, let's go get it!" "You gotta find something?" "All right, come on, come on, come on, come on." "Here we are, it's the jungle at night." "The second I stepped on this island, my life changed forever." "And I've been looking for this clue." "Let's go look." "It's probably behind the tree over there." "I was worried Cowboy wouldn't find the clue." "But the good thing about Cowboy is that he's resourceful." "And he will make sure he finds something." "He did find something." "Just watch what it is." "Oh, man!" "This should be the clue." "Where is it?" "Where is it?" "Cowboy found the clue." "Where is it?" "Cowboy found the clue." "It's a coconut with a little string tied to it." "It's probably underwater." "I'll go down and get it." "Don't!" "The water is so cold!" "I'm going to get in the water and help him." "Are you out of your mind?" "No, don't get in the water!" "You're gonna get hypothermia, and then what?" "He could drown." "You can't do this to me!" "You can't do this to me, dude!" "I'm just gonna go for it." "Here we go." "I'll turn my flashlight on so he can see what I'm doing." "I'm not doing this alone." "Are you gonna do it, or am I gonna do it?" "No!" "Don't do it!" "Get out of the water!" "You can't swim!" "We have to call somebody!" "He was about to go under." "There's no point in calling 911." "It would take way too long for anyone to get there." "The water is so cold!" "And I've never been in water this cold before." "We don't know if Cowboy is gonna make it." "Get back over there!" "I have to help him." "Come on, buddy, get back in the game!" "I don't wanna be the reason you lose!" "I was the last to find out the clue is on an island behind us." "I would see something and it'd be behind me." "This thing keeps falling." "We have to see if it has the clue." "I was hoping that if we made it past the first thing, it would lead us straight to the clue." "I can still hear this noise." "I have no idea where it's coming from." "I can hear it." "Do you think it's from inside my helmet?" "It's right over here." "I don't have any idea." "Just take the chance." "Ain't gonna hurt you." "And I'm glad that I did it." "I couldn't even hear the sound that we were looking for." "And I was hoping that that was it." "That's the sound it was making right there." "At least we tried." "So, we have to do the same thing on the next one." "And then the clue is there." "Now, we have to find it." "Let's do this!" "Come on!" "Go to the other side!" "Dude, hurry up!" "He must be near there." "When Cowboy saw the clue, he found his old spirit back, and he knew that this game is not over." "Go, go, go, go, go!" "Come on!" "Bring it up!" "Are you in the water?" "Yes." "Okay." "Here you go." "Here you go." "You almost fell out." "Get down from there." "Get down from there!" "He got it!" "Are you okay?" "It's gone." "Let's go." "Go, go, go!" "That's how we make this way to the next clue." "I was hoping this would be our only bad luck today." "Oh, no." "The map is wrong." "The clue wasn't there." "It was about three miles back, at the very beginning." "And now, we have to go back three miles." "I don't even wanna think about it." "I know the guys are tired, and I'm exhausted." "But I'm not going back." "And Cowboy and I just got reconnected, and I'm keeping him motivated." "Can't wait to get back to camp, though." "Good job, dude!" "My God." "Here we are, everybody." "Thank God!" "It's freezing." "I'm so glad it's you guys." "Yeah." "Thank you." "Thank you, man." "Appreciate you." "You got my back." "There's my spot right there." "Yeah, you guys are awesome." "How you guys doing?" "How did you find that clue?" "He found it!" "We were looking for the clue, but we couldn't find it." "We had gone off course for a little bit, and then we just came back out to that area where it was, and here it is." "This guy's found this!" "Let's go get this clue." "I can't believe Cowboy found that clue." "I was worried he wasn't gonna find it at all." "And he wants the second place check more than anything." "Okay, guys." "You're good for another night." "It's been a long day." "There's been a lot of twists and turns in this game." "We don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow." "I really didn't expect to find this clue." "And I hope that I get a chance to play with some of you guys again, because I know we can do better than we did today." "That was a bummer." "I'm feeling a little better about myself right now." "We lost the challenge, but I found the clue." "And now I'm just glad we got the opportunity to get back in the game." "We gotta get back out there and do our best." "Hey, guys, we have a problem." "What?" "What's wrong?" "Apparently we're going to have to go get this clue tonight." "Wow." "All right, I'm gonna take this one." "This looks like a good route." "But you guys are going to have to watch me, because I don't know the way." "Let's go!" "We have to leave right now." "That didn't make me feel any better." "I know what that means." "We have to go get that clue tonight." "I got my shirt on." "I got my shoes on." "Who's driving?" "We got to go out there and find the clue." "It can't be that far." "And when we finish it, we'll come back." "Hey, where's the clue?" "It's right here." "Oh, here it is." "It's right there." "Let's go!" "Let's get it!" "How are you feeling?" "I'm actually starting to feel a little bit better about the game." "A little bit more confident." "You can do this, guys." "Let's do this." "Let's go find</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:06
