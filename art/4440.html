We have a small, but loyal and faithful following, and we are trying to revive the radio show so it can be heard again on 91.1 FM in Orlando and 92.9 FM in Sanford, FL and online here on The Bitter Biscuit website.

The show plays classic rock from the 60's, 70's, and 80's! Every week on Sunday, we pick one favorite classic rock song from the 60's, 70's and 80's and play it again in a radio show format on the air.

Thanks for listening!
