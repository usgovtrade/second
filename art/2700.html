Bette Midler, who will receive the ICON Lifetime Achievement Award, will present the award to the nominees. In addition, John Travolta, who has been nominated for a Male Artist Grammy Award 19 times, will receive the award honoring contributions to music. That year, he received the Grammy in a surprise appearance.

The Grammy Awards will air live on Sunday, February 10 at 8PM/7PM Central on CBS.

The 59th Annual Grammy Awards will be held at Staples Center in Los Angeles on February 10, 2015.

The Grammy Awards are voted on by The Recording Academy's 7,000 members and the awards for this year were given out last month. You can find the full list of winners, both the main categories and all the special awards here.
