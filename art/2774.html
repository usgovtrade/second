In December 2016, an announcement was made that a boys-only team would be formed to represent the school in 2017.  According to an article in the Crows News section of Crows Central, "as part of the boys-only program, school officials decided that there would be separate team times for boys and girls and no-mixed gym classes" which included weight training, circuit training and strength training. In 2017, the boys team and girls team competed as individuals and did not run a team.

Other sports
The boys' basketball team has reached the state final four. In 2013, the Crows finished 4th at state but defeated Gawler High School and Woodville High School to advance to the final four where they defeated Murray State to claim their first championship in the school's 52 year history.

The school has won four premierships in football in recent years.  A mixed team competed in netball at the 2018 National Netball Championships, having won the state championship in 2013.

Netball won the SA State Netball championships in 2018.  This win also ended the Western Thunder's run of 7 State championships in a row.

Curtin Crows also won the 2018 School Games Championships netball title and took out the 2018 School Games Cheerleading titles.

Curtin High School has a successful athletics program, with four athletes making the Athletics South African school record books, three of whom were selected to represent South Africa at the 2007 World Youth Games in Beijing.
