“I could be a little cocky, I could be a little too full of myself, but it was my best to give it to you in the best way possible. I got through it because I knew it would be an important experience for me. You have to stand up for what you believe in,” she said.

Nearly a decade later, the two women still keep in touch, sharing a mutual love for one another’s music and remembering the good old days. Their friendship became the inspiration for the new musical based on the book “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf,” by Ntozake Shange.

“Black Girl Magic,” originally written as a one-woman play, is now being turned into a musical, and “The Color Purple,” which also explores the issue of sisterhood, has a revival on Broadway with Cynthia Erivo playing Celie and Jennifer Hudson as Shug.

There will be workshops and readings of “Black Girl Magic” in spring. A national tour will follow in the fall and “The Color Purple” has already sold out Broadway’s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, but Lena said this story about women and sisterhood remains as relevant today as ever.

“This piece has to be done every single day. It is important, because we’ve never been here before as black women.”
