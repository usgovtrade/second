father" is very difficult to say. There is only a single paragraph of
the account in the work that is authentic, and this was paid on the
7th of July, 1783, to Mgr. Lortz, the representative of Pius VI. in
the States of Salzburg. In this document the value of the money spent
is stated at "four francs," and we are told, in conclusion, that all
the "sons" are now good Catholics. Even granting, therefore, that
all that is stated in these curious fragments of old _Bescheinungen_
be true, it is difficult to know what they are intended to convey.
The fact remains that in 1786 there was one hundred and three children
at Passau, a number considerably augmented a few years later; but it
must not be forgotten that in the same year at Fachau there were six
hundred and fifty-three children, and in 1790 there were five hundred
and eighty-nine!

The population of the "convent" was augmented in every direction
by the influx of numerous disciples and children. There are even
advertisements that are supposed to have been published on behalf
of that "illustrious prelate and noble ecclesiastic," Hieronymus
Schoenerer, whose exertions as apostolic vicar had made possible the
expansion of the community.

The community itself did not rest content with the number of its
children, but was much concerned with their instruction. This
instruction was to be general, not because the founder could not
direct it in any other way, but because he wished it to be so. The
spirit of this prelate was very large and very generous. The Church
of Rome might rest in peace; but her children must not cease to grow.
This care for the education of the young was, however, a little
irregular, and the results were not always the best. The foundation
was an association in name, but not in spirit.

All this time the general was making extraordinary exertions to raise
money. He took out patents of nobility. He endowed the place with
endowments. He sent embassies into the great cities. He took measures
to obtain papal approval of a bull ordering his children to be
confirmed. He formed a special committee of ecclesiastics, of laymen,
and of children to secure the confirmation of his work. When these
efforts failed, he appealed to the court of the Emperor Leopold. In
fact, he wrote letters to a great variety of people, and the result
was that in 1789 Leopold himself actually visited Passau and gave
much attention to the place. Such was the state of the finances of
the place that, in order to repair the roads and the bridges that
connected it with the surrounding country, it was necessary to
borrow L100.

It is necessary to say a word about the education that was given in
the community. There were twenty-two _bureaux_, as the schools were
called, one of which was held in the basement of the principal
building. There were in all nine hundred scholars, the children of
priests, monks, and laymen, and were taught not only the usual studies
such as reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, etc., but also modern
languages and music. These schools were open to the children of all
classes; but, in order to be admitted to them, it was necessary that
the child should be "well instructed and well born." The curriculum was
almost wholly religious, and the lessons were all from the Bible. The
teachers were under the direction of the "provost," who combined with
this office that of master of the community. There were four of these
men, two at Passau, and two at Oberammergau, where they taught the
village children and the girls of the "convent." There was a large
attendance at these schools in the winter, but it was less in summer.
From all these schools, which formed a large part of the town of
Passau, there came, in 1819, thirty-four men and fourteen women who
have entered ecclesiastical orders. This means that nearly one-third
of all the "daughters" have become ecclesiastics. There were also one
hundred and forty-two priests and monks in the Passau monastic family.

The number of children at Passau has gradually increased, owing to the
fact that it was the only place in Austria in which people could be
educated in the true faith, and that there were no children except the
orphans of families to whom they wished to give an education. When a
child is not to be educated in the common schools, it is a little
troublesome to take into account all the possibilities of its future
destiny. The child therefore remains an "orphan."

The "convent" had for many years been surrounded by hostile attacks.
From the end of the twelfth century it had been a refuge for the
"children" who were being sent away from home, a refuge that was
closed in 1786. In the period between 1786 and 1789 there was a time
of great tumult in the country, and the community was once more in
danger. After these troubles passed away, it was again free from any
external pressure. The city of Passau was, however, constantly troubled
with a very different kind of trouble, which was the result of a
very natural curiosity on the part of the inhabitants. All these new
disciples of Passau were more or less curious to see with their own
eyes the extraordinary place in which they lived.

It was, however, necessary that the members of the community should
be well treated. This they were always willing to be, provided that
the visits were not too frequent. It was necessary also that they
should be treated on occasions with as much consideration as if they
were respectable and well-to-do persons. Thus the fathers and mothers
who had been taken out of their homes to give them the care of the
Church, were often subjected to great annoyance when they appeared in
the streets. They were exposed to public derision and insult. In 1805
there were many such cases, and in one case a servant of the society
was arrested on a charge of "attempting to murder." The trial lasted
ten days, and, although it was known that she would probably be
acquitted, she suffered the horrible punishment of being dragged at
the tail of a horse through the streets. In 1820 the court of the
district of Passau decided that three children of the Passau community
were to be expelled from Passau. The proceedings of the court did not
show any cruelty or severity, but simply a determination to see that
the rights of the congregation were respected.

Thus, in every generation, after it had been founded and during its
existence, the Passau community has been exposed to the storms of
popular hatred.

It has, however, always survived this persecution. Nowhere else in the
world has the community of the "daughters" of Passau existed. There is
no such place and no such community elsewhere. Many people believe that
it is impossible to educate and raise a body of children in any other
manner than the way in which it has been done in this place. It is true
that its existence is an indisputable fact, and we need not fear that
its fate is to be that of many communities that have disappeared. That
is why it is so interesting to find it. If we look at the work and
compare it with what others have been able to accomplish, we must
agree with the men of the world who have called the Passau community
an "anomaly."

GUSTAVUS VASA


There is no doubt that Gustavus Vasa was one of the greatest and
greatest known men of his time. He is the man of whom England boasts,
and we are told that it was "He who broke the power of the Danes."
These are not empty words, for Vasa really did break the power of the
Danish rulers in Sweden and Finland. It is an open question as to what
are the limits of this great achievement; but what is not doubtful is
that he was a very brave man, that he was of a very good family, and
that he was one of the noblest and best of princes.

The Swedish kings of the House of Vasa were of German origin, but
their kingdom of Sweden became an independent nation on May 17th,
1523, when the last of them, Erik XIV., died. He left Sweden to his
father's brother, Charles, the last king of Sweden who bore the name of
Gustavus. Gustavus I. of Sweden was descended from the youngest son of
that King of Denmark whose murder had begun the struggle with the great
monarch of the north.

The family of Gustavus I. was an old family, and, although in Sweden it
is called Gustavus Vasa, its original home was in Denmark. When King
Gustavus I. was born, his father was Duke George of Mecklenburg.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:22
