Specifically, the present invention is directed to a composite filter, which has a replaceable filter element secured thereto by means of a plastic collar and which provides a self contained chamber to hold the filter element. The filter disclosed in the present application provides a number of advantages over the prior art including a number of replaceable and washable filter elements, replaceable filter elements that fit a number of different filter housings, and a housing that is formed of molded material or at least using an extruded material. These and other advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following Detailed Description.
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a composite filter comprising a filter housing having an interior and an exterior and including a generally open top and a generally closed bottom. A filter element is disposed within the housing and secured thereto by means of a plastic collar. The filter element includes a side wall, a top end, and a bottom end. A top cap is secured to the top end of the side wall of the filter element. A bottom cap is secured to the bottom end of the side wall of the filter element. The bottom cap is sized and shaped to be received in the interior of the housing and secured to the housing.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the housing has a first end and an opposing second end and includes an opening extending therethrough from the first end to the second end. The filter element includes first and second filter elements. The first filter element is disposed within the housing and has a first end and an opposing second end. The first filter element is also shaped to fit within the housing. The first filter element has an open bottom end that receives the top cap. The second filter element is secured to the first filter element and extends therefrom. The second filter element also has a first end and an opposing second end and has a side wall, a top end and a bottom end. The second filter element is secured to the first filter element so that the top end of the second filter element is in contact with the top end of the first filter element. A top cap is secured to the top end of the side wall of the second filter element. A bottom cap is secured to the bottom end of the side wall of the second filter element. The bottom cap has a hole that aligns with the opening in the housing and includes a plastic collar molded thereto or otherwise connected thereto. The opening in the housing also extends into the first end of the housing.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the side wall of the first filter element has a thickness that is smaller than the side wall of the second filter element. The thickness of the side wall of the first filter element is smaller than the thickness of the bottom cap. The bottom cap has a hole that aligns with the opening in the housing and includes a plastic collar molded thereto or otherwise connected thereto. The opening in the housing also extends into the first end of the housing.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the side wall of the first filter element has a thickness that is larger than the side wall of the second filter element. The thickness of the side wall of the first filter element is larger than the thickness of the bottom cap. The bottom cap has a hole that aligns with the opening in the housing and includes a plastic collar molded thereto or otherwise connected thereto. The opening in the housing also extends into the first end of the housing.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the filter element has a first side wall that is longer than a second side wall. The first side wall is larger in cross section than the second side wall.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the filter element has a side wall having a height and a cross section. The cross section is greater than the height of the side wall.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the filter element has a side wall having a height and a cross section. The cross section is smaller than the height of the side wall.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the housing has first and second housing sections. The filter element has first and second filter elements. The first filter element is disposed within the housing and has a first end and an opposing second end. The first filter element is secured to the second filter element such that the first filter element is secured in the second housing section and the second filter element is secured in the first housing section. The side wall of the first filter element has a thickness that is greater than the side wall of the second filter element. The bottom cap of the second filter element has a hole that aligns with the opening in the first housing section. The housing also has a third housing section. The side wall of the second filter element has a thickness that is greater than the side wall of the first filter element. The bottom cap of the first filter element has a hole that aligns with the opening in the third housing section. The housing also includes a fourth housing section having a bottom end. The filter element extends into the fourth housing section and the second end of the first filter element is in contact with the bottom end of the fourth housing section. A top cap extends from the bottom end of the fourth housing section into the third housing section.
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of making a composite filter element. The method comprises providing a housing having first and second ends and an opening extending therethrough from the first end to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:29
