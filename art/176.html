"My mind is my only tool that allows me to do my job."

MFTL is based on the simple premise that a physician is like a musician, and 
therefore, a physician must train as a musician does, in their mind.

I recently took this theory to the next level with a patient who was having 
intractable headaches, and as a result, I was able to eliminate the headaches 
by creating a "mind-tuned" sound for him. It had to be custom made, and you 
can hear it at www.mindtune.net. This was another one of those "Aha" 
experiences, and that patient is now headache-free. Dr. Jones has also 
confirmed to me that migraine headaches are not only caused by physical 
stimuli (light, sound, etc.), but also a "thought disorder."

I think that when we have this experience and the result is very profound for 
the patient, that it supports the "mindful" theory of medicine. I will report 
back to you if I get a chance to interview Dr. Jones about the article.

In the mean time, please feel free to visit the site.
