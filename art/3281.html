And then there’s the cost of housing. In Manhattan, the average one-bedroom apartment costs $3,175 a month. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $4,000.

Meanwhile, the cost of a subway fare has nearly doubled over the last eight years — from a little more than a dollar to $1.50. A gallon of regular gas costs $3.99, up from $2.70 just four years ago. And if you need to visit the doctor, the average copayment has increased nearly 40 percent in the last decade.

So, what is it about the city that makes life so expensive? Here’s a look at what a little government intervention — from local and federal regulations to foreign trade — has contributed to that price tag.
