“I got my swag back, I'm gon' show you who got it right.”

“I got my swag back, that's why I'm on these streets, you know how we do it. You know I'm on this.”

The song begins with two separate stories that tell the message of the song. First, the tale of a father who is trying to raise his son. Dad plays his part in order to “show his son how to throw hands” and show that “you don't have to run from the law.” He stresses how even though he is always there for his son, that his son must be there for him too. The song also explores the idea of being able to come back from failures, being able to pick oneself up and start all over again. The second part of the song is a reflection of the life of the singer. In the first verse he references the song “Shook Ones” by Mobb Deep. In the chorus, the song describes a man who is willing to go back to prison to show his son who has swagger. He ends by asking the same question of the father in the beginning of the song “I got my swag back, I'm gon' show you who got it right.”

The song also alludes to being a man and the struggles that come with being a man. The lyrics are not so much focused on a moral standpoint, but instead the idea of being a man and how men are different from women in ways such as physicality. Within the song there is a refrain that focuses on this difference with the lyric “And in my area I'm known for doing it. On my own, I think they call me a big homie, big man of mine.” Here, the emphasis is not on the fact that the man is a good person, but on his physical strength and fearless mentality.
