In this one, the cat appears in the first scene of the movie talking to a pair of detectives who are investigating his employer, a local mob boss, for gun-running and other forms of mayhem. The narrator then says that the cat is arrested for the theft of $3.00, and subsequently convicted of it.  

The movie is an outtake from the Warner Bros. short "Slippery Slope", which features Bugs Bunny coming up with one outrageous solution after another to a series of impossible situations. 

As you can see, the two are similar in that they both involve a cat and a similar crime.
The cat is a clever criminal (or if you prefer, a clever thief) and is arrested for stealing three dollars.
In the second part, he tries to convince the police he was framed, and then convinces the judge that he is telling the truth.

This was the short shown with Thieves' Holiday.
Wikipedia gives this short a list of title numbers: A Fish in Trouble, Slippery Little Sucker, The Dummy (The Dummy, The Dummy).
From the text of The Dummy:

Scene 1 - At a local tavern, the drunken owner (John T. Murray) offers the crowd a free beer if they will pull the arms off of a dead man laid out on the counter. He gets a volunteer and starts to pull off the man's arms when suddenly the cat's whiskers begin to twitch, causing the armless body to sit up and scratch his eyes.

Yes, you have the answer. It was the short The Frisky Cats. 
The short can be found on the VHS tape "Thieves Holiday". 

Cat: Now I want to give this kitty an injection to relax him. But I
  can't get the tube into his vein.
Doggone it, there he goes again, scrambling around on the ceiling. He
  got away! What am I gonna do? I want him when he comes down, but I
  guess he must have got out the window.

What? They said the cat is at my house. Let's go.
[police]
Good morning, gentlemen, I'm sorry we intruded on you this morning. The cat you are looking for is here in the house. You see, he was framed in a scheme to blackmail a man named Martin and he was also framed in a scheme to blackmail my employer. That is enough to get him 15 to 20 years in prison. But not us, for if you let him go we will have to go on living this way. 

The cat in the short, that had been framed, said the following:

Oh, excuse me, sir. I wasn't really stealing.  I was merely testing the security system.  It's a wonderful system.  When the burglar alarm rings I will have plenty of time to escape before the cops come.  Thank you very much.

In the main story:

Cat: Now I want to give this kitty an injection to relax him. But I
  can't get the tube into his vein.
Officer: If you'll just hold him down, ma'am, we can tranquilize him, so he won't feel any pain. I know you don't want to kill him, so we'll just take him out in the garden and then we'll let him go.

The only other animal who seems to be a good thief is the monkey in "The Dummy", because he managed to take the "stolen money" away from the police.

He had been taken away by the police to be a witness against his master, a shifty burglar named Martin, when he and the other animals had come to the rescue.

The reason why this is an outtake is because the animators accidentally removed it during the editing process. 

But there was a cartoon called "Cat's Paw", which wasn't really related to the movie, although it is the only time you can see a dog stealing in an old Disney cartoon.

There is also a very similar looking cartoon called "Stroke of Genius", where a cat steals two fish and a monkey steals a piece of bread.

Here is the part where they are trying to steal the bread:

At the end, the three of them run away with the bread and the camera zooms out to show them, walking away from the monkey's house in the forest. 

The rest of the video can be seen here:

Here are some screenshots from the short that can be found on the internet:

If you are talking about the full short and not just the story of the short:
The cat is the one with the stolen money:

The cat is framed for the crime:

Bird is supposed to be a thief, but is framed for the crime (not sure why, can't think of a reason)
