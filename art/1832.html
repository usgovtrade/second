The authors offer an interdisciplinary study of the nature of the pathological power-seeking that unifies all elite and cultic movements, and explore the psychological and sociological forces that propel individuals into positions of authority. An underlying theme throughout is the importance of education in the formation of a more fully human individual and of society as a whole.

“As far back as I can remember, I have always thought about the world in terms of story. As a professor of religion, my career focused on understanding how stories get passed on, from one generation to another, as part of human society’s heritage of knowledge and meaning. I was fortunate to do my graduate work at New York University’s Creative Writing Program and to develop my early interest in writing short stories into a profession. This book is one of the best things I have ever read. I look forward to discussing it with students at the university where I still teach, as well as with colleagues and friends in the academic, public, and business worlds.”

J.P. Lewis is the founder and co-director of the Center for the Humanities at the University of North Texas (UNT). He was educated at Yale University (BA), University of Texas (MA) and the University of North Texas (PhD). His teaching and research interests span a variety of subject areas: American religious history; religion and society; religion and the arts; comparative theology; and new media and information science.

This is a book in which three leading scholars — Dr. David V. Barrett, Dr. David Brin, and Prof. J.P. Lewis — engage in a stimulating dialogue concerning cults, elites, elites, religious movements, cultic power, and cultic power — from a historical, sociological, psychological, and philosophical perspective.

The authors take a broad view of what is meant by the term “elite.” Although elites are typically believed to be those who are distinguished in a particular area or domain of life, the authors here recognize a much broader understanding of the concept of “elite.” They propose that an elite is any elite is any category of persons who come into or attain power because of their possession of superior intelligence, talent, ambition, drive, character, charisma, or will to win. The authors show that nearly all the world’s major religions, civilizations, or nations have their own group of elites. Elites are common to all cultures and all people are likely to become elite at some point in their lives, in their careers, or in their relationships.

Cultic power is a kind of power that can only be acquired and maintained by those who are deemed “in” to an elite. The authors distinguish a cult from an elite. They propose that cultic power is power that results from a belief that one is the “chosen” one of a secret elite who are all in direct contact with supernatural powers or entities.

The authors focus on cults and elites in terms of what they are and how they function in contemporary societies. They discuss the causes of cultic power and elite behavior. They also study the role of education in forming a person’s elite status and power, whether it be in political or religious movements.

The research in this book is based on the research of many psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, and religious scholars from around the world, and it was meticulously vetted and checked before publication. It is a wonderful book, but at the same time also an extremely important one. It should be considered for required reading in many colleges and universities across the United States and Europe. This book should also be read by any parents who have children who are involved in any cult or religious movement.

Books Related to Cults and Elites: The Nature of Power-Seeking and Its Effects (Critical Studies in Existentialism)

This book was written by the founder of one of the leading independent bookstores in America, New York’s 92nd Street Y. It brings together some of the most prominent writers, scientists, and scholars of the past century to present an argument for the use of critical thinking as a tool for living a more ethical and productive life.

In the book, each chapter begins with a letter from the alphabet and presents a key idea explored by the contributors that begins with that letter. The chapters themselves address diverse ideas including love, knowledge, responsibility, change, and meaning. This book is best used as an introduction to critical thinking and the art of asking good questions as it provides the conceptual framework for the development of the critical thinker.
