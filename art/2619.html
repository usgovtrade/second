# A LITTLE BED IN A LITTLE BEDROO! [1882]

A Little Bed In a Little Bedroom!

Little Bed in a Little Bedroom!

I think it's a fine thing to be born in a little Bed in a little Bedroom,

Loving parents and a loving Nurse, and out at the doorway stands a Squirrel!

And there are all the little Children; they don't want to sleep yet,

So down the street in the evening you can see them, a little Group.

And Father stands at the door and Mother at the window,

For they have time to look at the Little Bed in the Little Bedroom!

For them it is truly a nice thing to have a little one:

They can take care of the little one and they have nothing to fear.

For Father comes home so tired from his work and out at the door he goes,

And Mother is busy cooking or at the window is spinning, and when she takes a look, she's contented with the little one.

I think it's a good thing to be a little Child and go to bed so early.

I would like to have a little Bed in a little Bedroom,

And when you go to sleep at night at least one little tear falls!

I would like to have a little Bed in a little Bedroom,

So that when I lie down to sleep and I think about the little one,

Then I could cry, and cry and cry without any guilt.

And when the Father is gone to bed, the dear Mother runs to the window

To look out once again to see if she can see him at her door.

I think it's a very good thing to be a little Child and be born in a little Bed in a little Bedroom!

For when I see the little Children in my Little Bed in my Little Bedroom

I cannot help but think I would like to have one too.

Oh! If I were a little Child I would not stay away from them.

I think it's an excellent thing to be in a Little Bed in a Little Bedroom

And as you think of the children in their little Bed in their little Room

The evening breeze makes you shudder, but only for a while,

For you know that it's warm inside, for the little Child is still warm,

And when the night falls, when the little one sleeps all alone,

The evening breeze makes you shudder, but only for a while,

And then I think of the little one and say: "I wish I too were a child."

# THE CUP AND THE GLAZE [1886]

## THE CUP AND THE GLAZE

" _Blow_ ," said the Wind, " _into my Glaze_ "

And it blew and it blew,

So that the cup began to shake

And to dance about in a dance.

And it danced in a dance,

So that the cup was still more light

Than water.

Then the Wind said: " _Let's play_!

_Oh, let's play! Let's play! Let's play_!"

And the cup danced about,

And the Wind said: "The wind is the Glaze!"

" _Play, play!_ " said the Wind,

And the cup danced about.

" _But I'm tired,_ " said the Wind.

_Oh, you're tired!_ said the Glaze.

_Oh, I'm not tired,_ said the Wind.

" _That makes two!_ " said the Glaze.

" _I'm not tired!_ " said the Wind.

But the cup danced about.

" _Oh, I'm tired!"_ said the Glaze.

" _I'm tired, I'm tired!_ " said the Wind.

But the cup danced about.

" _That makes three!_ " said the Glaze.

" _But I'm tired,_ " said the Wind.

_Oh, you're tired!_ said the Glaze.

_Oh, I'm not tired._ " said the Wind.

But the cup danced about.

" _Oh, I'm tired!_ " said the Glaze.

" _I'm tired, I'm tired,_ " said the Wind.

But the cup danced about.

" _That makes four!_ " said the Glaze.

" _Then I am_ , " said the Wind.

_And you are not,_ " said the Glaze.

The Wind said: " _Oh, what is going to happen?_ "

_I don't know!_ said the Glaze.

The Wind said: " _Oh, I'll tell you!_

_I'm going to drink_ , " said the Glaze.

" _No,_ " said the Wind, " _I can't let you do that!_ "

And the Wind blew into the Glaze,

" _Blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.

And the Wind blew into the Glaze,

" _Blow, blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.

And the Wind blew into the Glaze,

" _Blow, blow, blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.

And the Wind blew into the Glaze,

" _Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.

And the Wind blew into the Glaze,

" _Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.

And the Wind blew into the Glaze,

" _Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.

And the Wind blew into the Glaze,

" _Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.

"But I _am_ ," said the Wind.

"But I am," said the Glaze.

"I _am_ ," said the Wind.

"I _am_ , " said the Glaze.

" _Blow,_ " said the Wind,

" _blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.

" _Blow, blow, blow, blow,_ " said the Wind.

" _Blow,_ " said the Wind,

" _blow, blow,_ " said the Glaze.

" _Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!_ " said the Wind.

" _Blow,_ " said the Wind,

" _blow, blow, blow!_ " said the Glaze.
