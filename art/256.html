planning on sending me those types of emails.  If it was up to me, I would 
send them all back to you unread with no response, just so you know. Please 
consider what we have discussed in the past few months and rethink any further 
efforts on my email.

Thanks,

Gerald -

I am sure I have seen your email address on some Tiffany thing that was going 
around - I am in need of your services.  Would you please see if you can 
find/find copy and then email to me.  I need to submit something to her by 
tomorrow morning and it is giving me fits.

Thanks,

Chris

Thanks.
