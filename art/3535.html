It was originally planned for release on January 23, 2006, but an undisclosed issue with the song delayed its release to March 3, 2006. A second radio-only single, "Redneck Woman" (July 2006), also did not achieve airplay success, and thus it was not released to radio. It was released as a digital download on October 3, 2007.
