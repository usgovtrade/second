determined to be a professional fuck-up.  In the future, remember that you 
cannot choose your family;  you can only choose your friends.  And, for the 
record, I don't think your mother  is a fuck-up, I just think she was very 
stupid to marry a guy like you.    Good luck in school, and don't let the 
Duke horn-dogs get you down.  Let them know that you are special, and that 
you're going to make them proud, and that you will graduate, and you will 
make a great lawyer, and that you are going to "take your rightful place in 
history."

Jeff, fuck me.

Sally,

For your information, I am attaching a copy of my contract and a copy of
Reliant's FFL that we will send to the fed. police tomorrow.  I think your
phone message last night should help me relax a bit.  In the end, no one
that matters cares what job I have.  I am worried about keeping Jeff on the
track he's on.  Everything will be just fine.  In the meantime, life is
good.
