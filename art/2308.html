In 1990, he came back and lost again to the Ultimate Warrior, with the Ultimate Warrior leaving him laying by his feet after the match. As part of his return match from the 1990 Royal Rumble, Mr. Fuji challenged Tito Santana to a match at WrestleMania VI. Santana accepted the challenge and the feud between the two began when Mr. Fuji attacked Santana during the WrestleMania VI pre-show. The feud continued with Santana beating Fuji on several occasions.

After Santana dropped the title in July 1990, he continued to feud with Fuji. A match between them was set at SummerSlam 1990, where Fuji defeated Santana for the WWF Championship, which Mr. Fuji held for two months.

On February 8, 1991, the two met in the main event of the Royal Rumble for the vacant WWF Championship, and Fuji won by DQ when Rick Martel interfered, enabling Fuji to retain. At WrestleMania VII, the match was set to take place again and both men participated. Fuji began attacking Santana prior to the match while Martel entered the ring and got involved in the match. As Santana was about to fall to the ground, Fuji's manager Paul Ellering tried to interfere but Santana countered it, and he landed on top of Fuji, who was laid out on the mat. Santana attempted a cover but Fuji kicked out. He quickly pinned Fuji with his feet on the ropes and began celebrating until Martel grabbed the belt, prompting Fuji to leap off the top rope and hit the flying elbow drop on him and Santana. Santana pinned Fuji to win the title after a Fuji-breaker and the referee as Ellering helped Fuji back into the ring.

Mr. Perfect (1993–1994) 
In the fall of 1993, Fuji began appearing in vignettes hyping a new villain, Mr. Perfect, who was depicted as an evil version of Fuji. On January 23, 1994, Fuji was renamed Perfect as part of a new gimmick with the same face paint, silver suit, dark make-up, and a black beard. His manager and tag team partner, Mr. Perfect (a former enhancement talent who had feuded with the Road Warriors in the WWF), was introduced at the same time. On January 26, Mr. Perfect and Fuji made their first televised appearance on Monday Night Raw, where Fuji attacked Jim Duggan and attacked him again later on in the show after he lost to Jake Roberts. On February 16, 1994, Fuji and Mr. Perfect defeated The Smoking Gunns in a tag team match at a house show. On the March 5 Saturday Night's Main Event XXXI, Fuji and Perfect defeated Duggan and Shawn Michaels. The following week on Monday Night Raw, Perfect and Fuji challenged Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka for the WWF Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania X. They lost after Fuji was disqualified for kicking out of the pinfall attempt on Bigelow. At WrestleMania X, Perfect and Fuji wrestled the Legion of Doom in a losing effort.

Fuji got his first win against Shawn Michaels in a televised match at the July 18 Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII. At SummerSlam 1994, Fuji and Perfect went against Michaels and Diesel in a tag team match where Fuji got his second televised victory, which would be their last. After SummerSlam, Fuji lost to Diesel at a house show on August 22. After a televised match between Fuji and Diesel was held on September 10, Fuji took off his mask and was named The Undertaker.

The Undertaker (1994–1995) 

At Survivor Series 1994, Fuji lost to Yokozuna and The Rock in a tag team match in a Survivor Series match. A few weeks later, Mr. Perfect and Fuji formed a tag team and had a feud with The Smoking Gunns, as both teams faced each other on November 13 for the WWF Tag Team Championship at a house show. Fuji and Perfect lost the match when the Gunns won the titles by reversing Fuji's attempt to escape a figure-four leglock. A few days later at Madison Square Garden, The Undertaker defeated Paul Bearer in the main event to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. On December 14, Fuji made his return to the WWF and defeated Mr. Hughes, Mr. Fuji and Fuji's brother Kintaro in a street fight on WWF Superstars to win the vacant WWF Intercontinental Championship. He became a double champion, when he and The Undertaker defeated The Smoking Gunns for the WWF Tag Team Championship in a two-out-of-three-falls match on January 25, 1995. Fuji lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ken Shamrock at Royal Rumble 1995. On February 22, Fuji and The Undertaker were defeated by The Smoking Gunns, with both Fuji and The Undertaker's heads being attacked with nail clippers by Tommy Dreamer.

The Undertaker started a feud with Razor Ramon over the WWF Intercontinental Championship. After losing to Ahmed Johnson at a house show on March 8, Ramon gained revenge on Undertaker by performing a Razor's Edge on him. At WrestleMania XI, Ramon defeated The Undertaker to retain his title. During the match, Undertaker took a chair from the set, and slammed it into the mat, causing an unprotected chair to fall onto him. A rematch for the title was set for The Great American Bash, where Ramon defeated Undertaker in a First blood match and won the Intercontinental Championship. At the event, Ramon defeated Undertaker to retain the title in a two out of three falls match, with Kane interfered and helped Ramon win, so Undertaker threw his hat into the crowd.

Mr. Fuji II (1995–1996) 
After the incident, Fuji was fired from WWF and the Undertaker took over his role as a babyface. Fuji was replaced by his identical twin brother Kintaro, whom Fuji had beaten for the IC title at WrestleMania XI, and became known as Mr. Fuji II. Kintaro then began a feud with The Undertaker, which led to a handicap match at In Your House 2. The Undertaker pinned Fuji to win the match. Fuji made a special appearance in late 1996, when he accompanied Undertaker to the ring to face The Undertaker at In Your House 8, where he was eventually handcuffed and chained to the ring post by Undertaker as he gave a powerbomb to Bam Bam Bigelow. Undertaker pinned Bigelow to win the match and retain his title.

After Mr. Fuji left the company, Mr. Fuji II came back with a new manager, the new Big Bossman, who was The Undertaker's old manager Paul Bearer. The Undertaker feuded with Bam Bam Bigelow after Fuji's departure, while Fuji feuded with The Smoking Gunns. At King of the Ring in 1996, Fuji fought and lost to Jeff Jarrett in a handicap match, which Jarrett pinned Fuji after a DDT.

Post-WWF career (1997–2001) 
Fuji returned to WCW at Fall Brawl 1997 in the United States, where he defeated Brad Armstrong in a squash match. Fuji's final match was at WrestleWar 1997 in Tokyo, Japan, where he defeated The Great Muta. Fuji later wrestled in Japan, but he did not have any major accomplishments there.

Fuji returned to WWE and wrestled as a jobber. At WrestleMania XIX, Fuji participated in a battle royal that was won by the debuting Maven. Fuji teamed up with Al Snow as The Holy Rollers. They got their first win at D-Generation X: In Your House, where they defeated Too Cool (Scotty 2 Hotty and Grand Master Sexay).

Fuji made an appearance at the NWA 40th Anniversary Show in Las Vegas on September 3, 2000. He attacked Dick Slater after the main event.

Fuji took part in the King of Trios tournament, teaming up with Dick Togo and Makhan Singh. They faced Big Vito, Cibernetico, and Eddie Guerrero in the first round and defeated them. They went on to face La Familia de Tijuana (Mosco de la Merced, Pierroth, and Zacarias) in the quarterfinals, who defeated them. They lost to Último Dragón, Gringo Loco, and Vampiro in the next round.

Fuji would then be released from his contract with WWE in November 2000 and was re-signed by World Championship Wrestling, with his appearance in WCW being his last. He competed in a battle royal at the 2001 World War 3 event.
