Reception seemed scary but it wasnt what i expected basic to be. This place was and is a great school. I will go back soon.
I know we dont even have to be concerned about the negative posts. I am just sad when i see negative people.
One other thing that i have noticed is that this school needs a new cook!! The food stinks!!! You cant even tell what food is in there but its horrible!!!
Well what can I say, Its not perfect, it will always be something you need to work on. Keep doing your best, and keep trying to improve so that your students can have an amazing experience here.
Don't go here.. You will regret it. From the counselors, to the administration, this place leaves much to be desired...
I am one of the students who have had an outstanding experience at Fort Sill! I am in college now but all of my time at SMS was excellent!
The teachers and administration are willing to help you with any and all problems (that are not illegal or immoral) and the counselors are a great resource!
I met many great friends and most of them are willing to give me a job if I come home!
There are some people that don't get along at this school and can't make friends... Don't take it personally... Life goes on. You need to stay focused on your education and the experience that is waiting for you!
My experience has been amazing so far, the teachers care about your education and are willing to work with you.
Its a small campus with less then 300 students but that makes it easy to find an extra help class or tutoring help.
We live in a military town so our students get to participate in some unique activities.
Not much needs to be changed here, we have great teachers and counselors, they just need to do a better job of putting up signs so students can find our school.
Good school, bad staff. There are great teachers, just few administrators that want you to fail. The staff is very unprofessional. They are all just there for a paycheck. And if you question them they will call you an "attitude" student and do nothing to help you.
There is only a few teachers that care about the students success and some who are more worried about being a friend then an educator.
The food has been getting worse each year. But the library is awesome with a lot of good books. I don't understand why the campus isn't larger? The school needs more students to have a better reputation.
This school was a great place to attend from middle school to my senior year.
They didn't cut funding but made drastic cuts. I can't believe they actually pay $15,000 more than they need to for some administrators to do absolutely nothing. It's bad when our students are learning through the windows.
We've had the honor of being a military school for a long time but haven't seen any changes in funding or teaching for years. Teachers don't care anymore and don't even know what good teaching is. They are too worried about getting paid and can care less about the kids or parents. It's terrible seeing and knowing how much worse the school could be and isn't. We need help...
I have been a student at SMS since its founding day in the late 80's, and it is an amazing institution that helps prepare young adults to take their place in society. The military presence only helps with this, because it shows them just how hard life can be out there, and also just how much one can accomplish with hard work. Our military kids leave SMS ready to accept the challenge of success.
What I don't like about the school is that they are so afraid of the military leaving and losing money, that they have turned every single Military Kid away. We can't just transfer to a different school because we are on lock down! How stupid is that?!!
i think the quality of education is very bad. The teachers dont make lesson plans, and it just seems like they dont care if you succeed or fail.
The students at Fort Sill have great potential but there are too many distractions keeping them from reaching their goals. The people at Fort Sill need to take some notes from other military schools, like The Citadel, Penn State, etc. The military kids at those schools tend to have higher GPAs and ACT scores.
Fort sill is a fun place with many teachers who want you to succeed. All you have to do is work hard and apply yourself for great results.
Fort Sill Military Academy is a great place to be, i moved here all the way from Tennessee and it feels as though i have been here all of my life. Fort Sill is all about giving you a good education and the best part is when you graduate no one will hold that against you.
This school is amazing! There are hundreds of great things to say about the school. It's not perfect, but it's not broken. The teachers really care and they really push you to be your best. I think the school needs an update in sports equipment though!
This place is horrible, I feel sorry for anyone who has to go through this school, the people who run this place are awful and I hope something can be done about it because the reputation of this school is horrible.
Fort Sill has great classes, lots of clubs and activities, and a caring staff who give lots of attention to students' needs. However, students need to pay attention to their own studies because there are so many distractions such as cell phones, social media, and even each other!
Not bad! Not good! Not the best. Some people here just won't shut up long enough to get any work done.
