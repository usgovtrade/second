People can use WILT on the WILT Platform to buy and sell whatever they want, whenever they want, anywhere in the world.

WILT is an ERC20 token and WILT Platform enables you to store, send, receive and exchange the token wherever WILT is accepted.

The WILT Wallet is designed to enable a seamless exchange of WILT on the Ethereum Blockchain. As an easy-to-use currency, WILT Wallet also lets you store WILT, receive WILT, send WILT and use WILT in your everyday purchases.

WILT Token is a digital asset that can be used to purchase whatever you want on the WILT Platform. WILT is an ERC-20 standard compliant Token that is available on the Ethereum Blockchain.

The WILT Platform allows the users to access digital shopping malls and to enjoy products or services in an anonymous environment. The WILT Platform allows the users to be paid in WILT, Bitcoin and other fiat currencies. All transactions are instant and anonymous.

The WILT Wallet will ensure you are always in control of your currency. As a wallet, it enables you to spend, receive and store your WILT without the necessity to store them on an exchange or to worry about security.

There will be various WILT Wallets available in the near future, a desktop and web wallet, as well as a chrome app for use on the WILT Platform.

Our mobile WILT Wallet will provide you with a wallet where you can store WILT and perform transactions anywhere. You will need an unlocked mobile device and be able to provide us with your mobile phone number. You will be able to add, modify, or remove the WILT Wallet at any time and from anywhere, and you will be able to do so without the need to use a private key, a seed phrase, or a 12-word backup phrase.

WILT Wallets require an IP address and an ethernet address. You will only need to fill in the rest of your account details once. That will take care of your wallet setup. We will never require you to enter your wallet information again. If you ever wish to access or modify your account information, you can do so through the User Control Panel.

WILT Wallets will also allow you to spend the funds from your wallet at stores that accept WILT as a payment method, in exchanges and in other services that accept WILT as a payment method.

There is a WILT Wallet available now, an Android wallet, and others will follow soon. WILT Wallets and WILT Exchange accounts require an email address and an IP address, which can be used to recover a lost wallet or stolen funds.

We will never require you to share your private key, your seed phrase or your 12-word backup phrase. This information is encrypted on your device and will never be shared with us. It is only accessible in-wallet for verification and in the User Control Panel for account details. We have made sure the private keys are encrypted using military grade AES-256-CBC encryption.

The WILT Wallet is encrypted with a 12-word back up phrase. This is like your password. The WILT Wallet uses your 12-word phrase to back up all private keys. This means that if the WILT Wallet is ever lost or stolen, you can use the 12-word phrase to restore your WILT Wallet.

When you initiate a transaction you are required to confirm it through the use of a wallet private key or a 12-word back up phrase. The exchange will never see your funds.

The exchange does have your public key to enable the exchange to send you the funds you deposit into the exchange. The public key will never leave the exchange as we use multisignature address to store the funds.

This means that for you to receive the funds you need to provide the correct signature, which can be generated using the private key. But as we are using multisignature addresses, you can deposit into the exchange without being worried about losing the funds in case of theft or loss.

The WILT Wallet will always be in your control. You can access the information and add, modify or remove the account in the User Control Panel at any time.

WILT Wallets have private and public keys which are essential for the security and functionality of your WILT Wallet. In the user control panel, you can access the private key and restore your account with just your username and password. If you lose your password, you will be able to recover your funds by using the 12-word backup phrase.

Remember the words you wrote down in case you forget your password, you can use this method to regain access to your account. You will only need to write down the 12-word backup phrase if you lose your password, this means that even in this event you will only lose the funds contained in your wallet, you will not lose all the funds from your exchange account.

To regain access to your account and restore all the funds from your exchange account, you will need to enter your private key. We will never ask for your 12-word backup phrase or your private key. The key is encrypted on your device.

In case you forget the password to your WILT Wallet, you will be able to regain access by going through the wallet recovery option, or by using the 12-word phrase you wrote down.

The password you use to access your WILT Wallet and all your data will be encrypted. Once again, we do not ask for any sensitive information and passwords to your account. They will not be stored anywhere. The password will never be accessible to anyone unless you have a problem with your account or you lose your password. You will be the only one with access to your account details.

If you lose your WILT Wallet and funds, you are likely to lose all your WILT funds in your account as well. The WILT Wallet is secured by an authentication factor that generates a password for you every time you access the WILT Wallet. This means that you will not have to worry about anyone gaining access to your account.

Every wallet will have an option to create a new 12-word backup phrase. This is done in the User Control Panel in case you have forgotten your password. You can access this feature at any time from the Wallet Settings option.

Every user has access to their username, their password, their 12-word backup phrase and their WILT Wallet. Every user account has the 12-word backup phrase and a wallet private key that is also used to access your account information. This means that if you were to lose access to the WILT Wallet, you can recover the funds from the exchange account without the need to use the WILT Wallet private key.
