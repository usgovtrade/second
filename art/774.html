I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things! It  will be very difficult to replace that pipe without damaging 
existing line - particularly if PNM protests because of their recent letters 
about not wanting to foot the entire bill for the lateral line that will be 
stubbed. There are a lot of issues here.  Let's stay with Mike Minn 
replacement unless we change the recommended route.

3) Recommended Route.  Mike Minn and his people are recommending route 
Yankee North/  East of the San Luis - this avoids a curve where we have to 
keep emergency line on (we would not be able to rejoin the Yankee and the 
WECO at the same elevation). This would be a more level route (good for 
maintenance) and avoid bad ground  if our area has flooding or sink holes 
again. Mike Minn's stretch would be from about 15 kms past the interconnect to 
interconnect in the mainline. We would not take gas in near the interconnect 
to the mainline.  

I recommend we go through with the Yankee route but re-route the lines so no 
kinks and we go through ROW - hopefully we would avoid having to move the 
existing lateral at all. This may not be possible. In this case, please check 
with Enmax to see if they can get enough access at their side so that we can 
complete the project without damaging the existing line and if so propose a 
route.

4) Re-route the lateral. Mike Minn now has a new recommended route for the 
new lateral from the interconnect with PNM at the interconnect north of PNM's 
plant near the San Luis interconnect (or in the WECO's new right-of-way 
location) all the way to PNM's San Juan interconnect. This works well for our 
people and existing line. The price is $1.5mm versus $1.9mm. (We'd already 
paid $2mm to the WECO for the old route. 

They are proposing a change of location for the WECO. Apparently there is a 
path right of way available that the WECO is happy with and it allows them to 
run a bigger pipe. No environmental issue with this route. Mike Minn has 
forwarded this information to the WECO. We'll talk to the WECO and Minn to 
figure out what they recommend, if anything. Our preference is the new WECO 
route and work with the WECO to make sure they understand we are doing this 
to avoid damaging the existing line and make it possible to meet our delivery 
agreements.

Questions? Comments? Let's move quickly to get Mike Minn's route for the 
lateral.

Thanks,

Roger

Everyone - here's the first draft.  Please review and get me your comments.  
I'm going to add in the air permit stuff for Hanover and LIPA later.   


In addition, since both Peggy and I will be out next week, please submit 
directly to both Peggy and Roger on Monday all comments on the notice to the
