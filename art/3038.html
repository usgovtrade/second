Howdy I am so grateful I found your web site, I really found you by accident, while I was researching on Aol for something else, Anyways I am here now and would just like to say thanks for a tremendous post and a all round exciting blog (I also love the theme/design), I donâ€™t have time to browse it all at the minute but I have saved it and also added your RSS feeds, so when I have time I will be back to read a great deal more, Please do keep up the great work.

You've stumbled upon the greatest movie question and answer site on the web! To learn more about this site and me, click here.

And don't forget to click on those sponsors' banners, as they pay me for those advertising spots (in a slightly disguised form, so as to try to protect the identities of innocent, law abiding companies). When you're reading those sponsor's banners, just think of it as an advertisement for yourself: you, and your brain. Click on them all!

And that's our news page for today.

Our next movie will be Tombstone on July 19th.

Remember, a great movie deserves another look, so when you've got the chance, go watch one again!

What is the Liberal O'Matic?

The following is a posting from one of my favorite satirical websites, in the tradition of Onion articles. Be sure to read to the end for a greatomb irony.

Liberal o' matic....It's been said that liberals are just sane conservatives who are frozen in fear of being called crazy. It has been said that conservatives are just unenlightened liberals who haven't smoked pot. Somewhere, somewhen, these lines cross and we have the Liberal O'Matic.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:05
