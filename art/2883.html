Feige is right: The biggest characters in the Marvel universe are complex people with a variety of backgrounds. And so, from all-new, all-different beginnings, Marvel Studios is starting to bring a new group of heroes into focus in their feature film slate that includes Black Panther, Captain Marvel and The Eternals.

It's a slate that continues to set Marvel apart from other major film studios as it prepares to begin its own live action series on Disney+, which will launch in November with a live-action television adaptation of Star Wars: The Mandalorian.

We got Feige, the producer behind the likes of Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther, to sit down with us and discuss bringing the characters from the comics to the big screen. Feige also touched on what it means to be the boss of Marvel, how those fans react to the news of "infinity stones," and how Black Panther can bring a new group of characters to the big screen.

"I think for us, our mandate is always to honor who the characters are," Feige said. "The things that are important about them as people and things that are important about them as superheroes are what we're going to concentrate on first. What they do next, whether that's in this film or any of the other films that have yet to be made, it's what's going to give them the opportunity to make a better life for themselves or make a better life for people in the world."

Feige knows some things about good will and what it can do for a person. As the President and Producer of Marvel Studios, he has brought that same sense of good will and love of the characters to his feature film slate.

"If people felt that good will with Iron Man that when he died and you were left with an 'I am Iron Man' tattoo on your chest, it was meaningful to you," Feige continued. "That's a good thing to bring in and start to think about with this film and what are the values that we want to present in this film. With Captain America, are we representing him or is he representing us, as an outsider to us? And we are a super hero community in the Marvel universe that is a very large part of the world. What does that look like in America?"

Now, he's excited to bring new characters to the screen who represent different kinds of people in different kinds of worlds — even if it means expanding the roles of existing characters a little to create a more diverse set of heroes.

"Now, just by definition, any time you add a new character, it's a bit of a surprise," Feige said with a laugh. "But if you are as careful as we are when you make these decisions — which are not easy — if you get to an inflection point where you can add another character without breaking things and without breaking the characters that are already there. Then I think you go and find a great story for that character, and there's been so many new stories that have been told, and there will be even more stories after this. So, we're really excited."

Disney+ has always been about the story. The people of Disney have always been about the story. From Walt to Pixar and Lucasfilm to Marvel, it all started with a strong story. It is there that all of the Marvel films succeed, and why they should be watched by anyone interested in good storytelling.

Marvel will live on through its feature films, which the company plans to release through the next several years. The streaming service, Disney+ is here and it's going to take everything Marvel has accomplished in the last decade and turn it into a huge media conglomerate.

"I think that's part of the value for me as the person that's behind all of this, and is making sure that the characters are true to who they are and that they are represented in a truthful way," Feige concluded.

"And by the way, they should be! If you're telling a story about someone, there are certain things that you can't do in a story that are untruthful and will really break someone's heart or turn them off or make them not root for this person. So, I think we have to live up to that."
