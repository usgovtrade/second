This also became a chart success, peaking at No. 31 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.

"When Doves Cry" also entered the Billboard country singles chart.  It was originally written for Michael Jackson's 1993 album, Dangerous, in which Jackson was also featured.  The "unreleased track" was ultimately issued on Dangerous.  Since then it has been re-recorded and released on a variety of recordings by different artists.
