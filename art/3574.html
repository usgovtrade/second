(New)”

An epic tale of undead horror, the game plays much like the early Resident Evil games, though it adds many new features as well as a revamped battle system. Set in a small, abandoned fishing village, your battle with this deadly new foe is not just to the death, but with all life itself, for any living creature infected by the Zombies and their horrific master, the Arch-Vile will become infected themselves. Once under the Arch-Vile’s control, the victim can then raise and command a legion of Zombies as powerful as the King of Terror himself.

As your fight with the Zombie horde escalates, more and more powerful bosses will challenge you, as the arch-villain seeks his chance to rule the world. Will you be able to defeat the Zombie Horde, or will they doom the Earth and enslave the Human race? Your mission is to defeat them, and you will find them in countless numbers in the abandoned village, from far off woods, and from the depths of Hell itself!

Zombie Wars Collector’s Edition Upgrade Special

If you are an early collector and have already acquired the base game, but don’t plan to play it much before you get your hands on the Collector’s Edition, take advantage of the opportunity to upgrade for only $2.49 by using the coupon code COSTULET at checkout to unlock the new Zombie Wars Collector’s Edition bonus features.

The Collector’s Edition also adds the highly anticipated cooperative game mode, “Zombie Survival,” for use in conjunction with 1-4 players or a computer controlled AI for up to four-player multi-player action. To see how the “Zombie Survival” cooperative mode works, check out this video. For anyone who is interested, we added a video of a few moments of the Zombie Survival mode gameplay, showcasing how the cooperative mode plays.



Zombie Wars Collector’s Edition

If you have already purchased the game, and you are upgrading to the Collector’s Edition, no worries. We’ll honor any purchases made before this sale. When you download the Collector’s Edition, it will only replace the original game’s files, so if you had previously purchased the game, it’s nothing more than a new digital copy of the game.

To claim your Collector’s Edition digital download, simply download the game file and overwrite your original game data. The Collector’s Edition contains both a Steam key for the game as well as access to the new game mode, Zombie Survival, as well as a lot of added content. I think we already described most of this, but if you have any questions, just ask in the comments.
