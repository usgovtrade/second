Are there many domains nowadays that a registrar is really unwilling to sell?
Maybe I'm weird, but even in France every time I need a domain, every
registrar can find it for me (not sure about the prices, but they do manage to
find some of them). Just to check:

there's a shortage of generic terms which makes the internet really slow and
ugly to browse.

Yeah, I can't find a single page that works without Javascript.

What?! Seriously?

It's true.

I would love a few domains, but they cost me more than the domains are
worth... I'll keep wishing.

I am interested in several domains. What are the prices here in India?

You may need to try and find a registrar close to you. Here are some options:

I know I need some, would like to buy some.

I'd buy anything ending in .lol, but I can't find a single one!

This article was worthless without an actual table of prices.

it's a bit hard to find these domains since few are trying to sell.

What registrar?

I really want to buy domains.

Just getting the "confirm payment" is not a problem. I can't buy a single one.
No error message, nothing in the logs (obviously).

No tech details from you please, no URLs I can try myself. I use Gandi, which
is supposed to be the best registrar in this regard.

My previous registrar was .ca and I only used one of the others for testing,
I think it was Tucows. No luck on them either.

I have no idea what registrars actually go on about and buy each other's
names, which would be useful information. I just have names people point me at
now and then.

I'm on the verge of just emailing the registrars asking if they know what's
up.

Is this a problem limited to the US? I'm on .us.

The article was likely written by the author's company, and is, I imagine,
based on publicly available information, as I've never seen a registrar
unwilling to sell me a domain I want.

Don't ask me what price.

For an added frisson, I have had a .com go unclaimed for _months_ before.

I can't _ever_ find domains that end with ".shop".
