And for more information about the LAB’s 25th Anniversary Celebration, check out this post.

This week marks the 25th anniversary of Lab’s first year. To celebrate, the Lab is teaming up with LupusNY, the national organization for lupus awareness, to raise money for lupus research and outreach. From now until the end of August, you can donate to Lab’s charity, The Bikinis Project, a collaborative effort by Lab and LupusNY. And from now until September, Lab will be selling this year’s commemorative t-shirts (pictured at left) on its website.

After 25 years, the LAB continues to offer a variety of programs for people with disabilities — like the live theater project It's a Small World That Swings and swings into the 21st century with weekly screenings of classic movies like Singin' in the Rain and It's a Wonderful Life; and the documentary series From the Pipeline to the Big Screen, which looks at emerging filmmakers and how they make the leap from concept to premiere.

LAB's 25th Anniversary Celebration will be Sept. 13-15 at the Lab's hometown of New York City. The Lab's anniversary includes an extensive series of events, including:

On Sept. 9, Lab will honor LupusNY's 25th anniversary with a gala. On Sept. 12, Lab will celebrate music legends the Beastie Boys at The Bell House with proceeds benefiting its charity, The Bikinis Project. And on Sept. 15, Lab will hold an anniversary-themed performance and showcase of its many programs by performing, speaking and participating in a question-and-answer session with the Lab’s youth theater company, Theater Shed.

To learn more about Lab and its programs, visit labtheatre.org.

The Lab’s Anniversary Month began with a reception last week hosted by the Lab in the company’s home base, The Bitter End, where attendees enjoyed drinks and hors d'oeuvres, as well as a performance by The Lab’s own youth theater company.
