2) Short Twigs (5–6" long)   
3) Short Sticks (8" long)   
4) Sticks (12–13" long)   
5) Painted Logs   
6) Small, Medium, and Large Slabs of Stone

_NOTE: It is not suggested to use any type of rocks that have rough edges. If rocks are used, sand the sharp edges of the rocks before beginning the project._

#### **CUTTING LIST**

**1** Pick-up sticks (7–9-1/2" long)

Cut sticks to length

**2** Short twigs (5–6" long)

Cut sticks to length

**3** Short sticks (8" long)

Cut sticks to length

**4** Sticks (12–13" long)

Cut sticks to length

**5** Painted logs (1 per child)

Cut to desired length

**6** Small, medium, and large rocks (select different colors)

Large rocks—1 per child

Small rocks—4–6 per child

Medium rocks—2 per child

**7** Slabs of stone (select one stone color per child)

Large stone—1 per child

Medium stone—2 per child

#### **TIPS**

• _The wood can be different colors or shades of one color. If you prefer, a natural stone such as granite can also be painted, or use rocks of contrasting colors._

• _If a child makes his own paint colors, select at least two colors of each. Have the child paint the small sticks, which will serve as the paintbrush._

• _You may decide to let your child select sticks that he feels will be fun to build with. If so, have him first show them to the parents. Also, for older children, use this method to demonstrate the process of construction._

• _The first time you use the technique, have your child build his favorite shape first. Then you can experiment with different shapes and different arrangements._

• _In addition to building a house, you can use this technique to build houses for your pets._

• _You can also arrange the sticks to form various pictures and shapes._

#### **TIME TO BEGIN**

With an adult's assistance, make the paint brushes.

#### **MATERIALS**

Large box with lid   
Cardboard plates   
Craft knives, mat, and cutting board   
Construction paper   
Glue   
Construction paper scraps   
Scissors or other papercutting tools

1) Prepare the "construction area." Have an adult cut the pieces of cardboard to a size that fits easily in the box. Slide the plate out of the box and place it on top of the piece of cardboard in the box. Place a piece of construction paper over the plate and secure the corners with tape. This will serve as the playing surface for the house. The piece of cardboard provides a platform for the house to stand on, and the plate prevents the walls from moving during play.

2) Cut construction paper into various shapes and sizes. Show your child how to cut. If desired, fold or shape the paper. Use scissors to make simple shapes such as a door or window, or use more intricate folding to make other shapes.

3) Ask your child to think of pictures that she can cut out from construction paper and arrange on top of the plate. He can use her imagination as to what shapes will go with which shapes. Also, you may want to prepare several pieces of paper with pictures of animals, buildings, birds, people, and other shapes. You can glue the paper pieces on top of the plate, and encourage your child to cut around the shapes on the paper and arrange them.

#### **TIME TO BEGIN**

With an adult's assistance, make the paint brushes.

#### **MATERIALS**

**1** (18" x 24") canvas   
(you will need to use an   
extra large canvas if   
you have only a large box   
to use as your canvas)

Plastic bag   
Plastic spoon   
Bread   
Cardboard plates   
Construction paper   
Glue   
Construction paper scraps   
Scissors or other papercutting tools   
Paint

_NOTE: You can also make large canvas markers or large wooden pencils._

#### **TIPS**

• _Placing the canvas on the plates provides a soft and protected surface for the paint. (We do not recommend using glass plates.)_

• _You can provide plastic spoons and bowls for your child to dip the brushes in water, or you can use cups of water and let him dip the brushes himself._

• _You can use colored paper for the paintings, or let your child paint the plates. Make a plate that has green on one side and red on the other, and then let your child paint a forest scene. You can make a variety of things by simply printing pictures on colored paper._

• _Let the child experiment with his painting style, using brushes, cups, cups of water, or other objects. You can also encourage him to add leaves and other items to the painting._

• _The paints may not be good for long-term use. The brushes are used for only a few minutes per painting. If they dry out and crumble, they are easily replaced. The paint should be easy to clean off the plates with water. Sometimes we mix paints and water, and let the child dip the brushes in it. Let the paints dry completely before starting the next painting._

#### **TIME TO BEGIN**

With an adult's assistance, make the brushes.

_NOTE: Make sure that the brushes are big enough to reach the bottom of the plate. It's a good idea to have larger brushes for dipping._

#### **MATERIALS**

Tweezers or other small tool   
Paint or acrylic paints   
(any colors)   
Large plate, or   
small bowl   
Large plastic bag   
Plastic spoon   
Bowl of water or cups of water   
(1 cup per child)   
Cardboard plate   
Construction paper   
Scissors or other papercutting tools   
Paintbrushes   
Construction paper scraps   
Scissors

#### **CUTTING LIST**

**1** Paint (one color)

1"–3" wide piece of paper   
(optional)

Paint—select one color

#### **TIPS**

• _When you mix the paint together, put the water on first, and then the paint. The water will act as a stabilizer for the paint, making the paint flow easier when it is being used. It is okay to add a little paint to the water to make the consistency easier for the child to dip._

• _The paints should have the consistency of liquid frosting or cream._

• _Have your child experiment with the different brushes that she uses. For example, she may decide to dip the brush in water instead of paint, to create more contrast._

#### **TIME TO BEGIN**

With an adult's assistance, make the paintbrushes.

#### **MATERIALS**

Cardboard cutouts of   
letters (4–5 letters per   
child)   
Large, small, or   
medium cardboard cutouts of   
animals or other   
characters   
Plastic bag   
Plastic spoon   
Cup of water (1 cup per child)   
Paper or construction paper   
Scissors or other papercutting tools   
Watercolors or acrylic paints   
(any colors)

1) Have an adult create the house   
layout. This can be done using   
cards, a flat surface with a marker,   
or any surface that is large enough   
to support the house and allow for   
the child to stand back and watch it.

2) Show your child how to draw a   
simple house on the paper. Encourage   
your child to draw any house that she   
can imagine, as long as it has windows,   
a door, and even a roof. Add features   
like a chimney, bushes, trees, animals,   
and other objects.

3) You can experiment with   
different types of materials   
to create a house. Have your child   
select pieces of card stock and   
plastic for making the house.

4) Have an adult help you   
cut out the pieces of cardboard   
for the house. Have your child decorate   
the house, using crayons, markers,   
scissors, or any other tools that will   
decorate the house. Use various   
colored markers for coloring and   
drawing.

5) Have your child paint the   
house in any colors or style. Let her   
"decorate" the house with drawings,   
characters, or patterns. Use markers,   
watercolors, or other paints. Use   
plastic scrap pieces in the house,   
or make a window sash</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:51
