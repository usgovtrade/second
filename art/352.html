"I am not a man of many words..."

This led him to explain, in his usual manner, that his methods were the result of the experiments and research that were conducted by himself and others, in the field of electromagnetic energy, and was influenced by the knowledge and experiments of Tesla, and even the work of Nikola Tesla in regards to the transmission of energy (light). 
In summary, to achieve FTL, he required a series of frequencies that, combined, produced a specific result, or vibration which he termed as "inter-dimensional harmonic resonance."
Now here is the question, what are the specific frequencies (waves) he mentioned?
I have tried to find the answer, and there are tons of literature stating that the exact frequencies are known to Dr. Jones, but the problem is none of them are correct.
Also I have tried to track down the precise reference to those books, but some of them are written by Dr. Jones himself (I have found several of them).
Does anyone know the answer? 

A:

The explanation of Dr. Jones that has survived is as follows:  
For energy to be transmitted between two bodies, they have to share a “common frequency,” whether it’s in the radio spectrum or in space.  
The only known way to obtain a common frequency is by using the Zero Point Energy and the fact that it can be obtained through Zero Point Power Modulator.  
By means of these energy modifiers, one can connect two bodies through “Zero Point Modulator” devices which will give them a common frequency and establish a link.
According to Dr. Tom Bearden, who also knew Dr. Jones well, "The problem is that at the subatomic levels of matter, matter is all energy. There is nothing else, no mass, no atoms, just energy vibrating at different rates. These energy "strands" can be connected and aligned through the use of subatomic particle generators of specific frequencies."  
In other words, it would be impossible for humans to generate these frequencies without a "gateway" or "conduit" which would perform two functions.  
1) Connecting the frequency of a generator and a target.
2) Encapsulating the energy, thus creating a "channel".  
"This would be accomplished through means of sub-microwave particle generators, placed strategically in specific areas to control the speed of certain atmospheric winds, to control the flow of air over the oceans, to create specific areas of calm water, to produce specific vibrations on the ionosphere, to manipulate and accelerate the earth's magnetic field, and to create the specific magnetic fields necessary to create a portal."  
This statement by Dr. Tom Bearden echoes the words of the scientist that conducted most of the experiments on the pyramids in Egypt, the US Navy top secret bases at Groom Lake and the Montauk Project.  
The Montauk Project is a former US Military operation to find a practical means of harnessing zero point energy and to use it for practical means.  
"The technology could achieve this level of control over the environment because of the fact that the gravity is not uniform and has more fluctuations than you would expect. At the same time, the gravity effect is modified with this gravity generator. The main energy source of this gravity generator is the earth's magnetic field that can be controlled in a specific location."  
One other example of gravity generators that are described in different references, in slightly different terms is through the manipulation of the magnetic field, one can create a portal on the Earth’s magnetic field and by altering the strength and direction of the magnetic field, one can create a portal on Earth.

A:

The frequencies and mathematics of the transmission of energy, including from the past to the present, were explained in more detail by Dr. Robert V. Taylor, who worked at the Groom Lake Air Force Base, along with his team which included Dr. Hal Puthoff. It seems possible they may have also talked about the possibility of how the energy could be focused using a system such as a Van de Graaff generator to create the effect required. They were the ones that worked with the original US secret microwave propulsion program, which was started by the late Nazi scientist Dr. Nikola Tesla. We can see some of their references in the link below:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann
I'm not sure where the exact link for the books they are referencing from. However the books talk about the transmission of energy at specific frequencies which also can be used to focus it at the right point for it to manifest itself as the "miracles". I also remember an interview with Tesla where he mentioned how to focus this energy to any specific point on the surface of the earth.

"I have learned how to focus enormous
  amounts of electrical energy on
  points that I will choose, or that
  others have chosen, to do my will."

For more info, you can look at these links:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann
Here is one of the links talking about a possible way to do this with the Van De Graaff generator:
http://www.ufocasebook.com/ufo/indra.htm

The above is also interesting as well, since it shows all the different parts needed in order to operate this system which would make it possible to create the specific frequency needed, plus to focus it in the required direction at the right time. Ingo Swann also writes about how to achieve this, although he says to perform this he needs a much bigger space and a large number of Tesla coils. http://www.ufocasebook.com/ufo/swann.htm

Here is one of the books mentioned above talking about the transmission of energy using a specific frequency in order to achieve the desired effect: http://pantheon.uconn.edu/~cwalsh/ufo/tors.html

One other interesting aspect is that Dr. Tesla himself said the system he built with Nikola Tesla's input was also used to make sure the lights in some of the theaters would go out every time he came to them, since he would always go to the same theater and didn't want anyone to know it. It was a part of his plan to show that an individual can control the electricity and it was also a psychological tool to control people. They talk about this a little bit in the following link:
http://www.metabunk.org/thread3401-1.html
Finally the following video also talks about the possibility of building a machine to bring back people from the past and there is a link to the patent at the bottom of the video for anyone who would be interested in pursuing this idea.

I'll try to get the exact websites for the books they are using since it is written in a foreign language. This would give the most accurate information on this topic, since all of these books were either written by him or were based on his scientific knowledge of these types of concepts and experiments.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:27
