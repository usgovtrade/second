However, being that I had just discovered that I had the “wrong” type of peanut butter, I did not feel like going to the store. I was at my friends’ house and we were sitting at the kitchen counter eating lunch when she said “you like this peanut butter don’t you.” The question seemed rather odd as we were sitting there talking, watching the kids (and I) and I was eating the peanut butter that I bought a couple of weeks earlier. She had bought some Jif peanut butter that she knew I loved. I had a sudden craving for some, so I went to the kitchen, reached for my jar and said “yeah, that stuff is so good.” She said “I thought you liked Jif peanut butter.” It got really quiet in the room. I thought to myself “how many peanut butter jars did I have out?” I knew she had only had two peanut butter jars out – one for her lunch and one for us. I did not have that one. I also knew that she had only had that one jar on the shelf for a couple of days. The one that I had been eating was in the cupboard on a higher shelf, probably because we kept a couple of other things in there too. That is when I realized, I had not only been eating that brand of peanut butter all along, I had been eating the “wrong” one. I don’t know why she didn’t say anything before now. It must have been something that has been weighing on her mind, or maybe she was just looking for an excuse to get me to try some of the other ones that she had brought home. I don’t know what I was thinking, because I don’t even like the Jif peanut butter. However, in a couple of weeks, she was able to give me a variety of peanut butters, and I was able to find something that I actually like. At least that is something that she did get me to try. However, I don’t know if she got anything else I would not have tried on my own, and I am just giving her credit for that.

I have recently found that I am just not happy being home alone on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. These are the days that I just do not want to do anything. I find myself just wasting time on the computer, watching TV, and going through various sites online looking at various other things. One of these days, I want to find a nice place where I can read and relax in a nice, quiet setting, but I am not sure that it is possible right now, or if it will ever happen. Most of the places I have looked at that seem to have nice areas have not been cheap. They usually require an upfront payment, which is something that does not bother me in most cases. I just do not know what I am going to do about being home alone on these afternoons. I don’t think I am missing out on a lot, but there has got to be more to life than what I am doing right now. I am not sure that sitting in a house all alone is going to get me any closer to doing what I want to be doing in life. I am going to have to find something that interests me. It is getting harder to find things that interest me. I am not sure that there are many things that I really want to get involved with, but I know that I need to find things that will do that for me. I have some ideas, but they all involve me getting a new job, and that seems like a big enough goal that I will probably be content with it once I have achieved it. I need to start setting goals for myself again. There is so much in this world that I still want to do, but I am just not doing it. I am doing the least amount of work that I can, and there just needs to be more to it.

It has been almost two years since my last post, but that does not mean I have been sitting around doing nothing for that long. I have been reading a lot and working on various things. I have some things that I am working on that will probably never get finished and published. However, the time that I am spending on them is just to make sure they are as good as I can make them. When you are going to get published, you need to do everything possible to make sure that you have the best work possible, or the work is going to be bad and have nothing to do with your actual story, and then you will not be able to get published at all. Since I am starting out, it is necessary that I learn what needs to be done, but then I need to just move on to something else to keep learning. Some of these things are just going to have to be published in order to help me out. Writing is like a puzzle. It can’t always just come together and work out, but it is always possible. I just need to start thinking of all the little pieces that have to fit together, and then I need to think of all the little pieces that will eventually go into those small pieces. I just need to sit down and work. I don’t want to sit down and start with something, and then give up half way through and decide that what I am doing is just a waste of time. I am glad I am on that road, because it is only going to get better when I do something that doesn’t just work out half way through. I will not know if I am wasting my time until I have the opportunity to sit down and write something that will eventually be published. It isn’t that simple of course. It is like the saying that you have to walk two miles to work up a sweat. That is exactly how it feels sometimes. I am getting ready for a couple of books that are hopefully going to make it out in time. It doesn’t mean that it will be published, but it gives me something to look forward to in terms of finishing a project that will get published in the future. I am not trying to be a published author, but I know that I do need something to keep me busy and interested.
