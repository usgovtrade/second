Plot

Vanessa (Raven-Symoné), is a teenage girl who has never liked going to school. Her granny tells her that only one more test will make her a grown-up and she will have no more exams. To make the wish real, Vanessa, who always believed that everything was due to luck, has to say the magic word "abracadabra" three times. She does and it works and she now has three wishes, which she believes are just one wish, but are more like three wishes; if she is lucky, she gets to choose what to wish for. Vanessa wishes for the perfect girl friend, who will be able to spend her entire life with her. To her horror, the same exact scene happens in the park from the beginning of the movie when she makes the wish.

Meanwhile, Pooh Bear (Jeff Bennett) and Piglet (David Kaufman) are trying to figure out what to do with their free time while Eeyore (Jim Belushi) watches Pooh's attempts to become a writer. With only several issues of Disney's comic books, Pooh takes up the task to tell his first story. That night, Pooh decides to write it down, and this one page is going to be the base of his entire novel. However, Eeyore convinces him that, if he writes a story about Eeyore, he could make more money. Pooh tries to persuade him to give it a go. Eeyore refuses, but as he begins to feel sorry for himself, Pooh, in an attempt to make himself happy, gives in and decides to write about Eeyore's life. When Eeyore gets a call from a bird, Pooh decides to talk about it for a few pages, but after finishing, he writes, "and so on" and writes nothing more for the rest of the book.

Vanessa, at school, is in the hall, when she hears a giggly voice. Suddenly, from the book, Pooh and Eeyore appear, chasing a mouse. Vanessa screams and runs away, fearing she had had three wishes granted. As the movie ends, Pooh, Piglet, and Eeyore are watching a TV show about the life of a teenage girl and it's revealed that Vanessa became an author and has a book on her desk, which has the same title as Vanessa's name, in the same bookstore as her.
