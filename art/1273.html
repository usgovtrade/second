The beds are super comfy, and the rooms are well stocked with amenities like bottled water, tea, coffee and biscuits. Bathrooms are modern and well stocked with towels, toiletries, hair dryers and the like. If you get a room with a city view, you can even enjoy some light traffic. If you book ahead of time, you can get excellent online deals for the rooms here.

The Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel is a small budget option, but one that doesn't compromise on value. The rooms are basic, but clean, and staff is nice. The location on the Bayswater Road is close to some decent local dining spots (especially if you're a fan of Thai or Vietnamese food), and the neighborhood feels like a local one, though it is a little bit more quiet at night. Just a couple blocks from the London Underground, it's within easy access to the city center. The Radisson Edwardian is a good choice for budget travelers, but not all travelers have an aversion to looking around at their accommodations.

A short stroll from London's best shopping and restaurant neighborhoods, this hotel has some nice perks. The location on Oxford Street is in the heart of the action, and there's easy access to the Victoria Line Tube stop. This hotel's free on-site parking and close proximity to the Eurostar terminal is a nice bonus, but overall, there are better London hotels to consider for a more comfortable stay.
