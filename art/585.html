Instead 
of a few minutes I found myself 
confused. 
I felt sick and realized I needed
to leave the room immediately. 
I called a cab and I tried to stop
sweating profusely. 
I got in the cab and the driver 
was just staring at me. 
He could tell that I was high. 
So I tried to explain to him 
that I didn't smoke weed. 
I used to, but I haven't in
ages. 
He was persistent. 
He asked me if he could look in 
my bag and I gave it to him, but
it's private.
It's personal and it contains 
some very sensitive information. 
He also had to go through 
everything in my backpack. 
I got out and was just waiting
for a bus. 
I started to walk away and I got
a text from my friend saying he 
just came up to the bus stop.
I said don't ride up the bus 
with me. 
Don't do it. 
He got on the bus anyway. 
I know he saw that my eyes were 
glassy. 
I knew he could tell that I was
high. 
That's when I knew that I had to
get off that bus. 
I took off. 
I didn't want to catch up with
him or the bus. 
He's a small guy, so he's not a
big threat to anyone, but 
that's also why he's not a big 
threat to me. 
He'd only get punched in the face
or hit and then would probably
die. 
That's not a good fight to have. 
I don't want to hit or kill 
anyone ever. 
[Music] 
I knew I could call him for a 
ride, but I'd be out $20. 
Instead I called my mom. 
She knows. 
She's probably called, but never 
let's me give out my number 
because she doesn't want me to
ruin my life. 
If she calls, I'm going to tell 
her that I'm just going to a
movie. 
She doesn't need to worry about 
it. 
She calls me up and starts 
asking me how I'm doing. 
I tell her what just happened. 
I just smoked weed. 
It was good. 
No big deal. 
She was just freaked out. 
She was absolutely freaked out.
I can't tell you how 
upset she was. 
[Music] 
She told me I needed to call a 
rehab. 
She told me it was a public 
health and safety thing. 
I told her that I really don't
want to do that. 
And she just said you're getting 
picked up if you don't. 
I have friends that I've done 
those things with before, but 
we haven't smoked weed in a long
time. 
I've been clean for a couple of
years now. 
I'm not smoking around them, so 
they don't really know that I
have a problem with it. 
They think I'm a normal person.
That night they put me on a bus
to a rehab. 
When we got to the rehab 
headquarters I got off the bus. 
I was being escorted by an older
woman who they had just told me
I was supposed to call a certain
number to get picked up. 
We got into a room and there's 
some other girls already there.
The people that were helping us 
before left, so we are basically
waiting for people to come in and
get us. 
We waited for a very long time.
I was still high. 
We had to go through a meeting, 
but they took me into a room and
kept me out for maybe like 20 or 
25 minutes. 
They asked us a lot of questions.
I was the first to admit 
everything, so I'm not sure if 
that helped them to treat me 
better or make me feel less 
guilty about smoking weed. 
One of them asked me if I was 
high and I said yes. 
I could tell that she was 
confused. 
I told her I was on it. 
I'm like yeah. 
She asked me why I did it and I 
told her. 
She told me to ask God why. 
I just got in trouble for it. 
I said I'm sorry and that's it. 
She said she wouldn't let me out 
until I told her how long I had 
been doing it. 
I knew it had to be like a year 
or two. 
I told her like a year. 
That's all I told her. 
I'll just tell her what I feel 
comfortable telling her. 
There were three other girls in 
the room at the time. 
I asked them, too. 
It's a small group, but I asked 
them. 
One said she smoked a joint once 
in high school. 
She didn't tell her parents. 
The next girl said she smoked it 
before, but not much. 
The third girl said she had it 
a lot before, but not anymore. 
That didn't make me feel very 
good. 
I told the woman I was sorry 
again. 
Then she told me that I had to 
say it in a prayer. 
She called my dad over and 
turned off the lights in the 
room. 
I didn't know what she was 
doing. 
She asked me if I had it in my 
pocket. 
I told her I didn't. 
That's when she lit it. 
She made me tell God why I did 
it. 
I tried to explain to her that I 
didn't think that's what God 
wants. 
Then the woman said she saw 
something in the pocket that 
looked like a lighter. 
[Music] 
There are five of us sitting in 
this small room. 
I was not high anymore. 
I knew that this was a rehab 
program and that they didn't 
want me to be high. 
We were told to call this number 
if we were high or drinking. 
They'd show up and take us to 
their next meeting. 
I could call, but I knew I'd get 
some crazy phone call on the 
other end. 
I thought I'd done enough. 
I'm sober, so I'm going to call 
my mom, but not from the phone 
that we were given. 
[Music] 
She called me. 
[Music] 
My dad never found out what was 
going on. 
I have two younger sisters, but 
they didn't know either. 
He found out later. 
So after that. 
It was a pretty high. 
Not as high as usual, but it was 
pretty high. 
I think the pills and weed were 
combined or something. 
It was a bad combination. 
He would sometimes yell at me, 
but I think it was mostly 
because he was high and drunk. 
He didn't find out what happened 
to me for a long time. 
I was still dealing with things 
and still in bad shape. 
[Music] 
Since I've never been able to 
talk about this, there are some 
times when I think maybe he 
would be better off if he knew 
about this incident. 
When I was doing it, I was high. 
I was doing all of those things.
My mom didn't know. 
And I don't think my dad would 
have let me stop. 
That was really hard for him, I 
think. 
I think that it was hard for him 
to see how bad I had gotten. 
One of the craziest things is the
guy who found it, he didn't even 
know. 
He just came up to the bus stop 
and found it on me. 
[Music] 
You're high when you're coming 
down, but you don't care at all 
anymore. 
You're really tired. 
You have lost all sense of 
wherever you are in this world. 
You're just looking for the next 
thing to do. 
You're tired and you just want to
sleep. 
The bus from the rehab was 
coming, but I was still high. 
I was getting ready to move out 
of my mom's house, but I wanted</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:46
