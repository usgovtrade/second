And the rest

The other games in the box were quite varied. It’s unlikely anyone will play every single one of them. It’s also unlikely there are many games in the collection that I would actually want to own. Still it’s nice to have such a huge collection of games and the chance to play through some of them one day. I think this could be a fun event to get together and go through the games and see what we could come up with.

Other collections of retro games come from a person in need of money or a person who wants to offload some of their collection. Many games come out of their original boxes and in less than perfect condition. Many people keep their collection as is, meaning they don’t play many of the games in their collection at all. Unfortunately the chances of selling most of these systems are much lower than say, the Nintendo 64, as those machines were so popular and sought after when they were new that it was hard for many of them to be sold and then they were sought after again as collectables many years later. I have personally never sold or given away any of my collection and would like to keep it for as long as I can.

I wouldn’t consider selling my collection. The N64 and the SNES I don’t plan to play anymore. I’ve still got my Sega Genesis collection for the most part as I like to play some of those games now and then. I also have a PS2 collection and the original Xbox that I might eventually play through some of. Other than that it’s just an interesting collection of a time when technology moved at a fast pace and it was all about the games. There are so many old games out there now it makes me wonder what kind of games will still be played in 20 years. There are so many things we can do now with games that people could never even imagine back then. No one had any idea where things would go or what could be done with them. Video games are very powerful but also rather limiting, so we don’t see the games that are possible, yet. But now we do.

I grew up playing video games and always looking forward to the next big game release. I still play today and look forward to the next game releases. Even though I don’t have my old games anymore, my interest in them is as strong as ever. Maybe that’s a good thing as it means that as technology continues to move forward, so do my favorite games. We just don’t stop looking forward to the next new thing. As long as the games are good, I’ll keep playing them.

Seeing as how I didn’t have any money to spend this year for Christmas, I went looking for some really great deals and stumbled upon one of them while browsing through Amazon. The sale was for the Google Chromecast. I bought it and it arrived on my doorstep after only a week of me buying it. I had it for about a month before I started getting into more of it. I had already had my Apple TV for over two years and while it has been an excellent device, I wanted to find something similar that would work better on my Macbook and allow me to use Airplay with my Apple TV to stream my movies and music. It turns out, the Google Chromecast will do all that plus more.

The Google Chromecast can use Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire Stick to stream audio and video. It will not use your computer to stream video and will require an app to be able to stream video from your computer, phone, or tablet. There are other things I’ll get into later. It’s great when you’re travelling or don’t have access to your computer. Since I don’t have a TV in my room, I don’t have much of an option of watching TV when I’m in bed, or in my room while at home. For the most part, this works great. It allows me to stream video, either from my phone or the Apple TV, to my TV. This allows me to get some extra “me time” or hangouts with friends and family while not sitting in front of the TV with a bunch of others. I’ve only had the Chromecast for a little over a month now, but I’m already wanting more and the use cases are becoming more prevalent.

The biggest advantage I see for the Chromecast is its ability to play streaming video from my phone. It’s great if I want to stream something but I don’t want to sit and try to figure out where to plug in my phone, or where the TV is. If you can’t tell, I don’t like to use a TV for anything I can avoid it. I’ll admit it, I’m not into technology, yet I want to get my hands on as much of it as possible. At some point I hope to be using a Chromebook but for now, my Macbook is the best in the house for what I want to do. A Chromebook is great for those that are in love with technology and all the apps that can be made for it, but in the end, I’m not one of those people.

I’m trying to learn about my tech and keep up with the latest and greatest. As for now, this Chromecast is just a cool product that allows you to watch content easier than ever before. Of course, that’s just the easy side of things. The Chromecast is a product that should be mentioned when people talk about online media. This device really pushes the boundaries of my understanding and interest in technology and I’ve only had it a little over a month. I hope to keep learning more and share this product with you.

Over Christmas, my family has received new electronic toys for the house. My grandmother received a Google Chromecast for her room. I now have the Chromecast and two Chromebooks. A Chromebook is similar to an iPad in that it’s a computer that you use to browse the web and check things out and run all the apps that come with it. While it’s not quite as powerful as other computers, it’s super cheap and has it’s place. Most of the apps I can use on my Chromebook are easily found on my Macbook. At first I thought the Chromebook was a bit pointless and even considered it a waste of time. After doing a little research, I decided to give it a shot. After only a few days of using it, I’ve discovered my mind has been blown and it’s opened up a whole new world of ways to consume media on my Macbook and on other devices in the house.

The Chromecast is one of those things that a lot of people aren’t aware of or haven’t discovered yet. For those that are completely into technology, the Chromecast should already have made an appearance at some point. For those who aren’t, you have to understand that it allows you to stream from your smartphone or tablet to your TV. This would be most beneficial to use at home and as long as you have the latest software on your devices, it will stream audio and video from your phone or tablet to your TV. While using this feature, the devices don’t need to be on the same wifi network and the Chromecast only has to be connected to your TV. It’s amazing. You can make your phone smaller and your TV bigger! It will give you that “at home” feeling. I haven’t owned a TV since the 90’s and I certainly don’t use one while I’m at home. I have one in my room, however, and it’s hooked up to my computer that I watch movies and listen to music on. But, I use my phone or tablet to stream everything, and that includes photos. I use an app called Feedly, to read through RSS news feeds. The same app I use on my phone to surf the web, and the same app I can use on my Macbook to read up on the latest tech news. If you have Google Chrome, you can set it up to use the Google Feed feature. This means</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:30
