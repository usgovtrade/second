  * • What is the author's purpose? Is it entertainment, education, advocacy, or something else? What purpose can be achieved? What do you think this book is trying to teach you about the purpose of education?

  * • Why does the author believe that this book should be read?

  * • What is the author's opinion of this book's effectiveness?

## How Does the Author Use Literary Devices?

Read each passage carefully, and underline or highlight anything that catches your eye. Then scan the list of literary devices to see if you've found any.

### Plot

The author's method of structuring her work. In order to understand an author's purpose, you need to understand the way in which she's structured her work. Literary devices allow you to see how an author creates a coherent whole from all of the disparate elements.

  * • **Dramatic**  
To use something to make the reader feel strongly. You may use dramatic elements of characterization, setting, conflict, etc. to create a powerful effect.  
 * • **Bizarre events or characters**  
A dramatic use of the imagination. We have to give our imaginations a little freedom, but be careful not to overdo it or to make them up out of whole cloth.

### Description and dialogue

Techniques the author uses to create setting, characters, and conflicts in order to allow the reader to immerse himself in the story.

 * • **Describe**  
Use this device to describe events, settings, and other elements of a story. Show rather than tell the reader how things are.

### Characterization and characterization

Techniques the author uses to reveal the character's essential nature through events and dialogue. How the characters speak, act, dress, behave is another means of conveying essential character.

### Symbolism

The author's use of images and objects to create symbolic meaning. Many symbols have more than one meaning, and the author uses them with an eye to the reader's knowledge of the situation and in order to further plot and characterization.

### Theme

The author's use of morals or philosophical messages. The message the author wants to convey is, in essence, the theme. Read through each scene and note the major themes the author conveys.

## What Is the Author Trying to Tell Me?

You're looking for a central idea that is expressed in various ways through many aspects of the book. You need to find out what it is that is being said and what it is that is being accomplished.

 * • "You can't stop me, I'm the cat." (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde)  
What does the cat represent? Who is trying to make him stop? What does the cat's appearance mean? How do you interpret it? How does this differ from the first meeting between the two characters?

## What Do I Need to Do to Master This Text?

It is essential to figure out a way of doing this. How can you get at what you're looking for in a more effective manner?

Read the text and jot down any questions that occur to you.  
You can turn back to the list of literary devices to see what you've identified.  
Make sure you understand what you're learning about the other characters' lives and how that affects their understanding of the situation.  
Refer to the first meeting between the characters in order to analyze their characters.  
Note the recurring images.  
List the messages the author uses in an effort to let you know what you need to know.  
What does the author want you to take away from the book?

## Extending the Learning

### Create a Timeline of the First Meeting of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

For a first meeting between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, draw a rough time line in your notebook. On the timeline write down the time, date, and the setting in which each event occurs. Write in the characters' names next to each entry and place them in chronological order. Then, on the line representing the time in which the first meeting occurs, fill in these three areas:

  *   The name of the setting or event

  *   A few sentences describing the situation

  *   A brief conclusion to the episode

### Create a Timeline for the Dramatic Situation

Do the same as you did above for a timeline of the first meeting.  
Now, for each of the next five visits between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, draw in a timeline with the important events and the dates on which they occur:

  *   When the two meet for the second time;

The first time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The second time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The third time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The fourth time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The fifth time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

 *   The next time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The sixth time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The seventh time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The eighth time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The ninth time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

The tenth time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde

 *   The last time Dr. Jekyll meets Mr. Hyde;

### Create a Timeline for the Literary Devices

Find the passage where Dr. Jekyll first meets Mr. Hyde, and highlight the literary devices you see.  
What are they doing? What's the purpose of that device? (As with all literary devices, their role and effect varies.)  
Next, find a few other passages and write down the specific literary devices you see in them. Is there any sort of pattern in the author's use of devices? Do the devices have a common effect?

# Lesson 7:

# Analysis of Symbolism

 _This lesson takes a look at symbolism as a literary device. If you're a fast reader, it will probably be obvious to you. If not, you can find lots of examples of symbolism in the next three readings:  
_ The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe  
 _ The Great Gatsby  
 _ The Glass Bead Game_

 _ **Symbolism is what gives your story, poem, or novel its power.**_ _It helps the reader to make sense of the story by giving him a deeper understanding of what the characters are really like. You should be looking for symbolism in everything you read. This lesson will help you to recognize the way in which symbols work._

## Symbolism Throughout Literature

 _In this lesson, we will be looking at the use of symbolism as a literary device throughout several readings. In the first reading, you will find a particularly useful list of things that can be used as a literary device. The second reading, by contrast, is by an author who has a different use of symbols in his writing. The third is a poem that provides many examples of how you can use symbols to your advantage._

## Symbolism in Literature

 _When you read a story or a poem, you should try to take the time to understand what each event or line of dialogue might be telling you about the situation at hand. You might start by paying attention to symbols in the story or poem._

Symbolism can be found in literature of all kinds:

 _From_ The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe _: Symbols found in this story may be easily overlooked, and there are numerous examples of symbolism to be found in the words and actions of all the characters. The symbolism is often a bit more obvious in the first three sections. This is because the symbolism is used mainly to draw attention to the plot and to the setting of the story. Because this is a first novel, Lewis uses quite a lot of symbols in this work. He uses symbols in his characters and even in the setting._

### Setting

 _Symbolism exists in the context in which you find it. In the first two sections of_ The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe _, you find symbolism in the setting, namely in a land that you get to know through reading. You might call this "top-down" symbolism, since the symbolism is obvious to all who read the first two sections of the story._

This symbolism serves to inform the reader of what the story is about. It not only shows the reader what the story is about but also why the story is about this particular thing.

 _In the third section of the story, the meaning of each event and character becomes less obvious. Only two of the symbols are as easy to spot as the first two sections. To name a few:_

 _The lion:_

Symbols of Christ:

• His roar

• His red fur

 _Furness:_

• A lion-shaped wooden footstool

 _The witch:_

• The white cat

 _Wardrobe:_

• The wardrobe, which has 3 doors

 _The white cat_ :

• In the book, _The Great Gatsby,_ you find the most famous symbol of "the cat." What are some of its functions?
