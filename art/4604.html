Nintendo Direct E3 2015 – Everything you need to know!

On the day before E3 2015 officially begins with Microsoft’s press conference, Nintendo gives its own conference on what to expect from it, right from their own company. Here is what to expect from their conference.

Let’s start with Nintendo. At E3 2015, they are going to give a new trailer for The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. It is only a few minutes long, but it shows off some new aspects and gives more insight to what the gameplay of the next Zelda game will be like.

Nintendo is also revealing that Super Mario Maker will launch on May 11th and they are showing off the level editor. Also, Wii U Virtual Console games will be available for download on the Wii U eShop on the same date.

As far as amiibos are concerned, there will be 13 new amiibos coming from Nintendo at a later date. Those amiibos will be as follows:

Link (The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess)

Zelda (The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time)

Amiibo Starter Pack Bundle (The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds)

The Legend of Zelda (Breath of the Wild)

Star Fox (Star Fox Zero)

Mario (Mario Odyssey)

Animal Crossing (Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer)

In addition to the new amiibos that they will be releasing, a number of others are also being released at retailers or in bundles, including the Zelda Master Sword edition bundle. For more information on that amiibo bundle, go here.

Nintendo also announced some other new games, including Yoshi’s Wooly World, which is a new Yoshi’s Island 3DS game. The game is very original as you can choose your favorite Yoshi and he will produce wool. You can then use the wool to build different things with each of them. There are many different levels to play and the game also contains elements like competitive racing and even fishing. You can also play against your friends on Nintendo 3DS.

For more information on Yoshi’s Wooly World, check out my review here.

Another new 3DS title announced is Kid Icarus: Uprising, a new classic 3D-platformer game that will be available on October 11th, which is the same day as the game’s release in Japan. The game will feature a brand new story, new enemies and bosses. All of the previous stages and characters are back, but will have different mechanics.

One of the surprises that Nintendo had this year was Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree’s Woe and the Blight Below, a new game that is slated for a 2017 release for both Wii U and 3DS. This game is a crossover with multiple different titles and looks to be epic. You can watch my preview of the game here.

Next up is Poochy & Yoshi’s Woolly World, a brand new title from Nintendo’s partnership with Ubisoft that features a collection of minigames on the Nintendo 3DS. The game follows the Poochy and Lottie characters, as they visit each others’ worlds in order to promote Nintendo 3DS games like Monster Hunter Generations.

Finally, Nintendo is giving a new trailer for Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, a game that is available for both Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. It is a new Captain Toad game that involves a new mechanic where you will be controlling an army of Captain Toads that will help you fight off the enemies. In this case, they are all pirates who have the same captain as Captain Toad, but you’ll have to get rid of them all. The game will have a story mode where you can go back to different levels and replay them to complete additional objectives. There will be over 200 levels, plus a free update that includes levels and other things.

The full Nintendo Direct E3 2015 show is available in the embedded video above.

The Minish Cap was first released for the GBA and then remade for the GCN and included on the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. It was one of the very few Zelda games that had no 3D support when it was released. It was a very unique game, but then Nintendo gave up on their Minish Cap series until they decided to revive it with a new game on the 3DS. Now, it appears as if the original Minish Cap will be getting a sequel on the 3DS, a project that has been in development since the series ended up with the GBC.

Next up, we have Zelda’s amiibo figures. We will see a number of amiibo figures next year, including a Link figure and a Zelda figure, but this is a new Zelda amiibo figure. You can look closely at the figure and you can see that the figure is based on Ocarina of Time and not Twilight Princess. The figure features many of Link’s new attacks from the game. It has similar hair to Ocarina of Time as well.

The figure looks amazing and we are really glad to see Nintendo make a Zelda amiibo figure. After Ocarina of Time, it is likely the next Zelda game will be Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. That being said, Nintendo still has the Zelda from Breath of the Wild and the Wind Waker series, so that could still be a possibility as well.

Finally, it is time for Nintendo to talk about Super Mario Maker. This is a game that has been talked about for a very long time and the wait is finally over. They are finally going to reveal a lot of new information for the game. As you can see from the video above, there are many new features that you can now play on the Wii U and Wii U U Deluxe sets, including a variety of different tools, like paintbrushes, level effects, and more.

Now Nintendo has come out and revealed that Mario Maker is coming to the Wii U on the 11th of May. You can download it for free in all regions. Also, if you are in the United States and you subscribe to Nintendo of America’s online service, then you will get Mario Maker for free on your console.

That is all the news for this Nintendo Direct for now. Stay tuned, because there are going to be more reveals coming as time goes on. You can check out all the Nintendo Directs from the past with a search here.
