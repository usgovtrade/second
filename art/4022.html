A great interactive guide.

Teachers:

This is a wonderful game to integrate into any class. It is great fun for learning about sharing, personal space, and being polite. Perfect for any classroom.

Parents:

This is a great tool for parents to use when out with children. Kids love it, and parents and teachers will also appreciate how fun and educational it is.

The Teacher's guide and worksheets are fun to look at before using.

I found this interesting because it is aimed at kids only age 3 - 6 years old. That's me! I am 39. Some of the activities use objects that I don't have (especially some of the things I might use with toddlers), but the activities, explanations, and worksheets are easy and fun to use! I can help my son understand and apply it all at his level. I think the kids will love this too.

I am very pleased with this kit. It's fun and very easy to follow. My grand-children love to make these things together! That is what I want-their love of learning. I am glad there is a pack of these available. Thanks!

I love how this works out!!! All the colors fit my kiddos needs to learn to color and doodle! It has all the supplies that my students need. The kids love it. I can't wait to see what my students will create. It was one of the most interactive products I've seen. Love the way it is set up! Thank you for this wonderful product!

Wonderful! There are enough things for multiple children. The best part is that they will work together as a team and are really proud of the finished project. Thank you for offering fun and educational experiences for our kids. I am really excited about getting this to the kids to use and play with together.

My daughter is 3, and already knows how to write her name! We're thinking about what she's going to do once she masters cursive writing, but this is great too for her to practice and to get a head start!

Our son loves this. He likes the idea of making "art" with me and his brothers. It is a great tool to practice reading, writing, and math facts. We've done some drawing games that were so much fun and so good for his fine motor skills. We used to do this one at Grandma's.

We are very impressed by this product and appreciate the opportunity to try out the products before purchasing. It is very interesting and so much fun. I would recommend this product for children of all ages.

An amazing gift for Grandparents and Preschool Teachers, and a nice "baby gift" for toddlers! I was impressed with the clear instructions and the quality of the materials. They come in a nice storage box that was delivered safely, with no damage to our mailbox. Thanks so much for such a fun and educational activity! :)

We have always enjoyed playing school and just love to be taught and learned, so this is very exciting for our family! My 4 yr old granddaughter and I had so much fun putting all the lessons together! We love all the stickers! :) Thank you for such a great game!

We are doing lessons on "Good Touch, Bad Touch". We love that she made me a booklet to take in school with my kids, and has made me a "pencil holder" to hang in my classroom at school. This is a wonderful idea for all children who enjoy sharing, and are learning their colors. I highly recommend this product. It is well designed, has high quality pictures and text, and is attractive. A definite "Bright Idea"! I love it!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:32:45
