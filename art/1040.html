I'm getting the "no access to the microphone" on a specific website where the iPhone is connected. I checked the website with a "hacked" iPhone and it says that it won't show the microphone, either. I'm connected to the same network that I'm using for the iPhone in the browser.

I'm sorry to say that I tried pretty much everything to solve this problem, even after many hours of looking for something on the web.

Thank you for your help!

Solution

This problem is due to the location of the web page in the internet browser. When the webpage is loaded from the local device, it can't be displayed. In this case, please re-load the page from the internet or turn off the firewall.

Solution 1: Reload the webpage

As you already said, restarting the web browser will also solve the problem. Please try to reload the page from the beginning.

Solution 2: Configure the firewall

In this case, we can solve the problem by configuring the firewall.

Step 1: Click on the "Start" button.

Step 2: Go to the "Control Panel" -> "User Accounts" -> "Your Account".

Step 3: Select the "Network and Internet" -> "Windows Firewall" icon.

Step 4: Select the "New rule" and click "Next".

Step 5: Select the "Inbound" tab and click "Next".

Step 6: Select the "Port" tab and the click "Add".

Step 7: Type the following information:

Step 14: Select the "Enabled" and click "Next".

Step 15: Click "Next".

In this case, all the firewall security settings have been configured. When the webpage is loaded, the access to the microphone is no longer forbidden.

Solution 3: Use a mobile data network or hotspot

Sometimes we need to use a network connection, for example, to access the webpage. In this case, we can access the web page through a mobile data network or hotspot.

Let's see how we can access the webpage through a network connection.

Step 1: Connect the iPad to the internet via a mobile data network.

Step 2: The iPad is connected to the internet via a mobile data network. Please enter the website URL that we want to visit from the iPad.

Step 3: In this case, I entered https://www.iadb.org/iadb/.

Step 4: The iPad is now connected to the Internet.

Step 5: There is no microphone access problem now.

With this method, we can access the page. And we can solve the problem.

Solution 4: Make sure that the webpages you use are allowed to use in the iPad.

As you know, the iPad has a function to access the website with its specific permission. If the website is not allowed to use in the iPad, it can't be displayed. This problem can be solved by the following two ways.

2. Disable the security settings.

Troubleshooting

After the problem is solved, there are some problems left behind. If you can't solve the problem by following the above methods, the problem may be not related to Safari. In this case, you can restart the device or do a reset.

Tip

The iPad data may be lost after a reset. To save the data and configuration, it is recommended that you make a backup. You can save the data from the "Home" button menu: "More" -> "System". You can also save the data from the "Power Off" button menu: "Power Off" -> "iTunes & App Store".

If the problem is not solved after doing the above methods, you may need to repair the iPad. This function needs to be carried out by qualified personnel.

In this case, the problem is related to the hardware. Therefore, it cannot be fixed using software. You need to repair the iPad hardware.

Conclusion

This problem is not common. It may happen due to the settings in the security settings, security configuration or the web page itself. But this problem is solved. I have tried all the possible methods and hope that this solution works for you.

If there are some other better methods, please let us know by sharing your experience. If there are some other common methods, please post them in the comments. It would be helpful for the other readers.

I want to know is it normal to get a page blocked that contains a "camera" object on the iphone when using an iPad? I'm trying to get the webcam to work on a website using iframe but the website only works when the iphone is used.

If this is happening on your iPad, it's probably related to a bug in the browser or the page itself.

If it is related to the iPad, please go to the settings->iPad->Content and Privacy Restrictions. Make sure that the Website Access is set as "Allow" and the Website is allowed to use. Then try to use your iPad again.

If it still does not work, you can try to reset your iPad and factory settings. This function needs to be carried out by qualified personnel.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:22
