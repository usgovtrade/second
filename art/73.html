While using the current date as an example of how this can be done, Dr. Jones gave the following examples:

If a person would like to know how many years are remaining on the day that they were born, they would need to take the current date, and the number of days between the day of birth and the day that they are born to be the third digit in the calculation.
To see how many years are left of the month, the date is added to the current date.

Dr. Jones mentioned the last number needs to be divided by the number of days in a month and that it's important to make sure that the date is in the right month.
He also mentioned to always assume the greatest value when dealing with such calculations, and mentioned the following:

To help keep you from doing the same thing twice, a very useful bit of
  algebra, the greatest common factor (GCF), is always assumed. In
  mathematics, the greatest common factor is an integer that divides
  both positive numbers and numbers with the same sign, and is the
  smallest number greater than 1 that divides both. The example shows
  the month and year, and then you see where the greatest common factor
  is found.

Dr. Jones proceeded to give the following examples:

As it is the current month and year, the factor is 1.

As it is the current month, the factor is the next month. 

As it is the current year, the factor is 1.

As it is the next month, the factor is the previous month. 

As it is the previous month, the factor is the previous month of the previous month.

You just keep going until you find the factor. If you cannot find the factor, you need to start over. 

The factor can sometimes be determined without calculus, or algebra.

If you do this over a span of years, you need to decide how to deal with leap years, or you could even leave them out by taking a different leap year, or using the next two number part of a leap year as the factors.

So, for example, what if the person wants to know how many years are left from today, December 29th, 2019? You can add a month and a year to the current date, so the formula becomes this:

 

The next step is the next month/year to divide by the number of days in a month.

 

The answer is 2. So this is day 1 of the next month. You could proceed from there to calculate how many days are left in the year, which would be 2,096. If the person only wants the years, you can use the same two methods mentioned above. The factors could be determined using the current month and year to begin with and then taking the next month/year and dividing.

How many years are left on the year 2019?

 

The answer is 5. So it's day 25 of the previous month.

How many years are left on the year 2019?

 

The answer is 3. So it's day 173 of the previous month.

From this question, you can see that the person is making a mistake when they say, "Take the previous two digits of the current month and then add one". Instead of subtracting 1, they should be adding it. 
Also,  the answer to "how many years are left on the year" should be the day of the year on the day that you're born, if you subtract this number from the day of birth, which should be 365 as that is the number of days in a year.

A:

You should find the days of the month in which the date falls, and then get the number of the current month by multiplying the days by the number of months in the year, which is again 365 for a leap year.
Take for example the number of days in November of last year:
25
Add 1
1 month - 31
1 day - 31
365 days

So here the answer is 10 days.
Then you have to multiply by the number of months in the year:
365
1 month - 30
1 month - 31
2 months - 60

A:

We will find out this using the following simple steps:

1. Find the last two digits of current month using given two date values in your question. 

for example for question:

What year will the first day of next month be?

let the first date be: 2019-01-01, and the second date: 2020-02-01.
step:

1.1. Determine last two digits of current month - month 31

Now, let's assume current month is 2019. So last two digits of 2019 will be 89. 

1.2. Now, find the last two digits of first date  - last two digits of current month 89

now, our new answer is 89.

step: 

1.3. Now, find the last two digits of second date - last two digits of first date - last two digits of current month 89

Now, our new answer will be 89. 
2. Now, to find number of remaining years, simply, divide 2 from above answer. (in other words 89 divided by 2=44.5)

(1) for first question, the answer will be 44.5 years
(2) for second question, the answer will be 44 years. 

Hope it helps.

Let's look at a bigger example:
3. How many years will the first day of next month be? 
For the first day of next month - let's take 2020-02-01 and take current date. 

step:

1.1. Determine last two digits of current date - last two digits of current date will be 00.

Now, our new answer is 00. 

step:

1.2. Now, find last two digits of first date  - last two digits of current date - last two digits of current date will be 00.

Now, our new answer is 00. 

step: 

1.3. Now, find last two digits of second date - last two digits of first date - last two digits of current date - last two digits of current date will be 00.

Now, our new answer will be 00. 

step:
