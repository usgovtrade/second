The lymphatic drainage of the parotid gland has been studied by dissection in 80 adult cadaver specimens. Lymph nodes could be seen in the proximal and distal region of the parotid gland. The regional lymph nodes could be divided into superficial and deep. The superficial nodes could be found throughout the facial region and are derived from the cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus. The deep nodes could be observed in the parapharyngeal and retromandibular region and are derived from the mandibular lymphatics. The relation of these nodes to the facial nerve branches is such that a parotid tumor that is located near a deep parotid node may have drainage to that node as well as to the branches of the facial nerve. The facial nerve branches to the superficial nodes were located on the superficial fascia of the face. In most cases, the nerve trunk divides into frontal and zygomatic branches. The facial nerve in other locations was found to divide into frontotemporal and mandibular branches. The frontal nerve enters the parotid at its superior aspect at a distance from the superficial parotid lymph nodes and facial nerve branches. These nodes are important in lymphatic drainage in neoplasms of the parotid region. Knowledge of the anatomy of these nodes may have an impact on future treatment and prognosis of patients who have parotid neoplasms.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:16
