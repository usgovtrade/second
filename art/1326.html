And so we shall try to be wise, and understand the things that
are in heaven, and in the earth, through the power of the Holy
Spirit; which things, for the present, are declared unto us in
Scripture, which are true; wherefore come out from among them,
and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will
receive you. And again he said unto them, You know the commandments
of the Lord, because you kept them; and how in keeping of them
your fathers did inherit the land. Howbeit, for this cause,
the land became barren, and they were destroyed, because they
forsook the Lord, and burned incense unto strange gods, and took
the name of the God of Israel in vain. And the Lord said, Because
they have forsaken my law which I commanded them, and have not
hearkened unto my voice, and have not walked after me, but have
forsook me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that there
be no deliverance for them, then said the Lord, The time is come,
that I will cause the land to be emptied of them, as at the
beginning, and that they shall be utterly destroyed; that
wickedness may not be established in the land, which was turned
again to be a fruitful field. And the Lord said, If I bring again
the evil upon them which I did unto them in the wilderness,
wherein they were provoked to anger, and they walked out against
me, and would not hearken unto my voice, I would scatter them
anew among the heathen, and they should know that I am the Lord.
And the land is desolate, because of the wickedness of them; and
I have smitten none of them, but delivered those that were
appointed unto death; that the land might remain desolate. And
now, behold, the Lord is about to lay siege against them and to
destroy them. Now therefore, O ye children of Israel, put away
from you every man his incense and his idols, and let not
any of you bring in unto yourselves any more any manner of
graven image, or any likeness of anything, which is in heaven
above, or which is in the earth beneath, or which is in the
waters under the earth. And take heed to yourselves, that ye
forsake not the Lord, and that ye obey not the voice of the
Lord your God, but turn ye back from your ways and your evil doings;
and keep his commandments and his statutes which he hath taught
you: that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may dwell
in the land which the Lord hath sworn unto your fathers to give
you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord, the
God of your fathers, hath promised you. Therefore, if ye will
hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God, and will keep all
his commandments which I command you this day, to do them,
that the Lord your God hath commanded you: then shall ye live,
and be multiplied, and inherit the land, which the Lord your God
gave unto your fathers to inherit it; and it shall be an everlasting
possession unto you, for ye shall return unto it. But if ye will
not hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God, to observe and
observe all his commandments and his statutes which I command you
this day, then I will lay upon you all the curses of the covenant
which the Lord hath made with you, and I will pour out my indignation
upon you; I will spend my anger against you, and will do with you
all that which is evil in your sight; and ye shall be taken
away from the land which I gave unto you and your fathers; and
ye shall be adrift among the nations, and shall be an astonishment.
And the Lord shall scatter you among the heathen, and ye shall be
exiled nations from before the Lord: and ye shall be a reproach
among the nations that are round about you. And because ye have
chosen for yourselves to become a people for God unto himself,
therefore, I will abhor you, and will reject you, and will
forget your name; and I will make you perish out of the land
of your habitation: and I will afflict you so sore with your
enemies, that ye shall grope one upon another, and ye shall
fall over each other, as though the one of you were a reed
broken off. And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the
Lord, that I will cause to cease out of the heavens the voice
of mirth, and the voice of gladness, and the voice of the
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the sun shall be
torn into rags, and the moon shall be flayed, and the stars
shall be cast down upon the earth; and the powers of the heavens
shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming
in the clouds with great power and glory. And then shall he send
forth the angels, and shall gather together his elect from
the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the
uttermost part of heaven. Now learn a parable of the fig tree;
When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye
know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all
these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Verily
I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all
these things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but
my words shall not pass away. But of that day and hour no man
knoweth, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. But as
the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man
be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until
the day that Noe entered into the ark; And knew not until the
flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of
the Son of man be. Then shall two be in the field; the one shall
be taken, and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the
mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Watch therefore:
for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this,
that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the
thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered
his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in
an hour when ye think not, the Son of man cometh. Who then is
a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over
his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that
servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing. But
verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all
his goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart,
My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his
fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the
lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not,
and in an hour when he thinketh not, and shall cut him asunder
and appoint his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.

[Sidenote: Christ's
Character.]

Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave
me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger,
and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and
ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me. And they
also that are awed by his word, are blessed of the Father. But
I say unto you, that in this rejoicing there are some of you
that are here this day, shall be hereafter sorrowful. For I say
unto you, that there be some among you that shall in no wise
inherit the kingdom of God; but notwithstanding shall be cast
out as a branch, and shall be withered; and they shall be
delivered up to the burning: and men shall wonder that ye are
not in pain and anguish. But there are some of you that shall
in no wise taste of death, before the Son of Man comes in his
glory. But I say unto you, That in the regeneration, when the
Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall
sit upon twelve thrones</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:47
