The platform was created to offer something new for players who are bored by the current “standard” of the game — and to help build a better game for everyone.

The platform is a way for players to connect with other players. Every player is different and it’s important to allow people to explore those differences and find the best place for each person, “whether that’s on a leaderboard or maybe it’s a private message.”

As someone from the industry, the platform will become part of PokerStars marketing strategy as the company tries to reach the millennial market and maintain their competitive edge.

The platform is in its infancy now but should start to become much more active around April when the online market heats up.

“As PokerStars grows, and our presence in social media increases, we need to look at how we can expand the game and bring PokerStars to people who aren’t familiar with us,” the company said in a statement. “The platform is a step in that direction. We’re here to win, and this platform is a continuation of that philosophy.”

As the poker industry continues to grow, innovation and new ideas are crucial to the continued success of the game. PokerStars has shown the right way to do that and as their online tournament series has become more mainstream, their desire to create more avenues for players to enjoy the game will be an ongoing need.

PokerStars isn’t the only one to have a new social media platform in mind. New competition from Cake Poker has raised the ante in social media strategy, trying to find a balance between providing entertainment and making money.

The key for PokerStars is to keep up with the competition, but they won’t be the only ones. Whether it’s a site or a mobile app, the game is moving online and into new areas where it doesn’t have to go it alone.

New social media platforms are a way to take advantage of that. It’s no longer good enough for players to watch poker on television, online at a casino or play live. In today’s world, it’s the new social aspect of the game that brings people together. There’s more action than there has been in recent years, as companies like PokerStars and Cake Poker have shown us with their continued expansions in social media. The race is on and players aren’t going to stop anytime soon.
