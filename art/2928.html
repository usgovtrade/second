Some European governments have expressed concern at what they see as political pressure from Britain on Brussels.

The European Commission said on Monday that London has asked for a number of concessions, ranging from exceptions for financial institutions based in the British capital to a guarantee of market access for British businesses.

The Commission proposed that the rights and duties of EU citizens in Britain and British nationals in the EU be protected and called for “sufficient reciprocal rights” to be assured.

Echoing Cameron, the Commission said London has asked to continue to send people to the bloc, while also being able to make sure that British firms can still have access to European markets.

The Commission and Britain are both pushing for a transition period that would limit any changes to immigration, market access and oversight, before full membership terms expire in 2020.

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Britain’s ambassador to Washington, Sir Peter Westmacott, said the EU needs to address the concerns of many British voters if the country is to stay in the bloc.

He said Cameron should negotiate a “better deal” with his 27 counterparts in the bloc, who are increasingly worried about the effect of Brexit on the stability of the currency union and the eurozone.

A survey on Thursday by Teneo Intelligence found 59 percent of EU leaders thought Cameron should offer to abandon the goal of renegotiation before negotiating a better deal for Britain.

But it said that while EU leaders and senior diplomats were unified on the need for Britain to clarify its intentions, there were no signs that they were willing to accept any conditions attached by Cameron for British membership.

British officials have warned that a failure to address Cameron’s demands, including the reform of welfare entitlements to make them less generous, will lead to them losing power.

The head of Cameron’s Conservative Party backbench committee, Bill Cash, told Sky News on Friday that Cameron would remain in office even if he lost the fight for a Brexit deal.

“He has said he will implement the result of the referendum, so he will implement the result of the referendum,” Cash said.

“He hasn’t said he is going to be prime minister for ever or he is going to be prime minister till Christmas, so my reading of that is that he is going to go as prime minister and he will do that without having got a deal through, that will be a failure, so he will have to renegotiate.”</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:54
