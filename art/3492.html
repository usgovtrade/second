Welcome back to another exciting week on the Fantasy Football 101 Podcast. I think that we all know that it has been a tough week to start off the season, as everything is crazy and people are calling for the #Firing of many coaches. So with that said, let’s get down to some fantasy football business as we make it through the first slate of games. We have three of the top four defenses, three of the top four quarterbacks and plenty of surprises all over the place. Let’s see if the new starters in Philadelphia are the ones to help them back to being an elite team or if the Titans will fall flat on their face. But in this episode I am joined by Mike Clay, who starts off our discussion on where all of the teams ranked and who did he pick to go to the playoffs from our first draft! Also, I cover what I did with my rookie draft! Finally, since it’s Christmas time, I share a quick holiday list of things that are on my radar for the next week. With that, it’s time to sit back and enjoy the ride!

Mike Clay and I break down the latest rankings as the new era begins in Cleveland. What do we expect out of the new rookie running back? Also, are the Colts getting better or worse than what we thought?

We all have been on pins and needles and this week the players are finally back in action. Who had the best pre-draft rankings and where can the Titans be found?

We start off the week talking about which rookies we are excited to see in Week 1. Then we get into the quarterback play this week and who should you look to play. We do our usual analysis and then wrap it up with a little bonus.
