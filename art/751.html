"The only way you can really know someone's inner self is by having sex with them. And that's how you gain their trust."
And as for your last question, I will just say Dr. Jones was very clear and precise in answering them. 

I hope this clears up any doubts you might have had about Dr. Jones and his teachings.

A:

I should first comment on this passage:

This whole concept made me very nervous. Because I really did want
  more from this company than just a simple, one night experience. I
  wanted to really “invest” in the relationship, but the only way you
  can really know someone’s inner self is by having sex with them. And
  that’s how you gain their trust. And by doing this, you also gain a
  lot of trust in them as well. What I didn’t realize was that “trust”
  wasn’t exactly the right word. This is not about trust. This is about
  feeling the sensations of your partner. If you’re willing to surrender
  to their desire, they will then give you permission to do the same.
  They will also give you permission to see and accept who you really
  are. It is an amazing experience. It is pure ecstasy.

Trust in a professional setting, is most certainly not about trust. 
Dr. Jones said:

When you're in this space, you can't be trusted. You're so open and your mind is free and unencumbered... This can only happen with complete strangers, a trusted doctor and all of the senses present at the moment of connection. That's how we gain knowledge of the spirit. It's the most primal essence we have. 
When you're with another human being there is a trust. They're there to take care of you, to feed you, to provide for you, to love you, to care for you, and so they do that. You give up your life and all of the responsibility to take care of you, just the way we learned to do that from our parents and families. That's why we're here, that's why we have those instincts, because we have to rely on each other, but that's not the place you want to be. I don't want to be there. You don't want to be there.
But the more we surrender and put ourselves out of this space and let go and let the person take over, when you find that place where it's complete in both directions, it's truly a spiritual experience. And when you find that, you have made a step on the path.

You may want to take notice of the quote:

you can’t be trusted

And trust is a key requirement of 'professional services' such as the ones you describe. 

A:

I am not sure if this is good question or if it is bad question, because in some strange way it is both. In the end I guess if I have no chance of making good review of experience with this company, I could make a question that is less controversial and more informational. If I tell the story in a different light, maybe I can ask it more informally, like "how do you tell if the experience is bad for you?" and then people can leave their comment and there will be no downvotes or downvote-like action.
So I will post a different story, but if someone has different version, which would probably be a lot more interesting (and hopefully better quality of story to read), they can edit it and add a comment to make a separate question and vote accordingly.

My girlfriend and I went to a sexual pleasure party, paid for with her credit card, but I wanted to get on with my life and be on the same page as her with as little fuss as possible. So I was the only one that was there with cash.
We just got there, and it was some sort of room, like a small party hall, with a few couches and some bar, and maybe 20-25 people were there, no one was really my friends or mine, and the room was pretty empty at the moment.
There was also another woman, she was just laying down on some couch in some room and her eyes were closed, I guess she had some kind of medical problem that she just came for some help with. She was really pretty. We went and sat down on the couch and started talking. I have never been that deep into talking with anyone that fast that was that quiet and just listening. 
She told me a lot of things and I didn't even try to not be boring or not come off like a stupid idiot - but she talked about some wild stuff. She was like the weirdest woman I have ever met and I knew I didn't want to do anything with her, but we were just sitting there and she was telling me all of her problems and issues and problems with everything and anything that came in her mind, but not all in once, she stopped and asked me if I liked her body, and I guess she was waiting for me to say no or something, but I was not so comfortable with just saying no to this kind of a person, I don't know, she was so nice and all but she just looked strange to me, she wanted to know if I would sleep with her or something, she was really curious about my answer, I thought to myself "this is weird." 
But it was a free country, so I said yes, she asked me how long would it take, I said three seconds, she laughed and said "ok, then you have 10 minutes" and she just started to ask me about every stupid little thing that came to my mind, like, how do you masturbate, what is the most amazing thing you have done for her, what is the meaning of life, is there life after death, is there God, is there reincarnation, why do we have emotions, how do you go to the bathroom, do you ever have diarrhea, is it true that we know everything when we die, does time speed up as we get older, do I remember it all, what about the universe, could it be infinite, why does everything taste so gross, and where do the stars come from. I tried to be entertaining, I guess, but mostly I was just trying to make sure she doesn't get mad at me, but she liked my answers so much she said "you're awesome" and she asked me if I wanted to fuck her, and I said "no" and I don't know, she was very happy about that, because she started to tell me all these stories about how much she wanted to have sex with me, and she took a finger and pointed to her cunt, and was just talking about how much she wanted to be fucked, and all that for quite a while.
I don't know, I have never had that kind of luck, but I like the idea of having a girlfriend or fuck buddy that is into all this craziness. I didn't dare to ask her if she is normal at all, but I think she probably is. 
I don't want to take my time in the story and make it like an adventure story, so I will skip this part and just say she told me how many years she have been single, and I forgot how she told it, but it was an interesting story and this way I have nothing to say, or maybe I will tell a small part of it, I think I was really weird and I didn't know it was that weird and exciting, but I think there was also</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:59
