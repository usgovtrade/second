Our story begins with the night before Christmas.  It was in the old
days, before there were railways, even before there was a gas-light in
Edmonton.  Edmonton was just a big village; and on a fine summer's evening,
when all the people were away at their houses, or walking on the broad
street, they might be seen sitting in their doors, for as long as their
eyes lasted, enjoying themselves by the light of the moon.  This was not
only delightful for them, but also good for the country, as the bright moon
always brought with it a good harvest.  There were two of these old
moonlight people in Edmonton, and they sat with their hands round their
beloved tea-kettle, and looked at each other and laughed with enjoyment.
At last they heard the trampling of hoofs.  The horses had arrived at the
town from the station, and what do you think the children brought for
dinner?--oysters!  Now oysters are delicious, whether the country people
eat them by themselves, or send them out of town in that way, there is no
doubt about it.  So the moonlight people put on their spectacles, and
looked over the list of delicacies.  They saw there was, besides the
oysters, a lot of fowls, a leg of lamb, a partridge, and some other things
that they didn't think much about.  They had never, before, been in this
town, and didn't know what the people did, or how they lived; but, for
their part, they had lived well enough, and were quite satisfied with
their position, for they had, each of them, his own piece of ground, a
plough, and a cow.  So they resolved, as they always had done, to give the
children something to eat, and see what would happen.  When the child
entered their gate, and looked round at the garden and the grass, and the
old house, it could not help crying; but they knew, from the way in which
their own cows and calves had been treated by the town, that they were
obliged to keep on, and make the best of it.  The children took off their
clothes and sat down in the sun.  It was warm; and when the mother of the
child arrived, she sat down beside her husband and daughter, and asked what
ails the boy.  "Oh, mother, how he cries," said the girl.  "It's only his
nose that ails him," replied the mother, who had been an invalid all her
life, and didn't like people to cry; "and I think it's a pity you ever
would cry, you and your brother, on such a fine evening as this.  Don't
you see how beautiful it is?"

"Beautiful!" exclaimed the girl.  "No, indeed, mother; it's a fine place
to get all we want, that's certain.  It's a fine place to get everything;
but we shouldn't think so if we hadn't any town, with gas-lights, and all
that sort of thing.  You know, mother, it's very hard for us; and I wish
you would persuade your husband to let us have a town."

"Child, child," said the mother, in an impatient voice, "don't talk to me
about that sort of thing; we are always poor; that is, we always have been
poor, I mean; and if you won't go and see what it's like, to be happy,
instead of crying all the time, we must both go and earn our living as we
have always done."

"Well, mother, you are the greatest coward ever lived.  I don't believe
there's a soul in this whole town who would do what you are afraid to do.
You are afraid of everything; I've seen that from a long time.  I think
you'd be able to fight one of the boys who live in that horrid
conventivation, but you haven't pluck enough to go and see what it's like
to work at a trade; and what will you do when you've got nothing left?  My
father's a hard man, but he'll not starve us, as you call it; and if it
pleases you to make such a fuss about going into the town, there's nothing
for us to do but to go too."

The girl had hardly finished when the old men arrived.  They were,
naturally enough, rather slow of speech, for they had very little to say,
and hardly knew what they wanted to say, but they were quite ready to
accept the invitation of the children.  The children were glad to see them;
for there were few people like them in the village.  They had come from
the country, where they had spent their lives without the fear of doing any
good or any harm to any one.  They were very merry, and they would have
been very happy, but that their daughter, the young girl, was so cross;
and it was all she could do to keep from going out in the garden and crying
all night.  The old men looked at the children, and at each other, and at
the moon, and the sun, and the stars, and the flowers, and the grass, and
the clouds, and the sky, and the cows, and the geese, and all the
creatures, and saw that there was plenty of everything, and felt satisfied
with the world, and laughed as merrily as they had been accustomed to
laugh for many years.

It was nearly dark when they reached the house.  The old man was sent to
bed with a mug of beer, and the mother was asked what she had got for
dinner, as the cow was very slow in giving milk.  But there were potatoes
and beans, and some onions, and some herbs that they had just gathered.  It
was the old men's privilege, even then, to prepare their dinner.  They
cooked and ate it without troubling their wives, and then they settled
themselves on the couch where they had been put to bed, and fell asleep.
As for the young man and the girl, the mother, their own mother, had once
told them, when they asked her, how to behave.  "Children," she said, "don't
ask your mother whether it's well or ill to do any thing; but be quiet and
listen to her, and she will tell you what she thinks.  If she tells you to
cry, don't cry; if she tells you to laugh, don't laugh; but do what she
tells you, and you'll have no reason to complain."  So the young girl sat
still, and her mother sat still, and thought she was sure she had a
daughter who would live.  But the young girl cried as loudly as she could
until morning, and then, with her father's help, she got up, and began to
make the breakfast.  The old men were in a very easy, easy mood, as
children are in that blessed state of ignorance where there is no sense of
obligation, and no feeling that anything is expected of them.  They were,
for the most part, contented with their lives, and were never discontented
with the things they were doing, so far as they knew; and when their
mistress began to wish them to do something that would add to the
comforts of life, they were so happy that they knew not what to think.
Thus the two old men got up and went into the garden to work.  The mother
looked at them and smiled, for she knew they were glad of something to do,
and thought what great fools they were not to know how to be as
well-pleased with their lives as that was.  But her child was still
displeased.  She sat, with her hands clasped over her knee, looking out
into the garden.  She saw the cow eating and drinking, and the geese
gambolling about the meadow.  The sun shone on everything; and it seemed
to her as if it were all as beautiful as she could wish.  She sat with her
eyes turned up towards it.  She was thinking of the joys that seemed to
shine from it and from the sky and the grass; of the flowers that
flowered, and the trees that stood, and the brooks that ran, and the bees
that buzzed.  In her heart of hearts she felt that the flowers were not so
beautiful as the grass; and the flowers that grew in the garden were too
faint and pale to deserve a comparison with the flowers that grew in the
fields and the hedges.  But she had no means of expressing her ideas; and
she only sat, and looked, and wondered.  At last she began to weep.  When
she cried she was not satisfied with the things she saw, and she wished to
wipe them away; and when she cried, it was difficult to believe that all
the world was beautiful and delightful.  Then she wept again; and so she
went on, till she was tired of crying.

When she saw that her mother was in a very bad temper, she went to the old
men and told them to leave the garden.  They asked her what was the
matter.  "Nothing," she said; "don't you see what a fine day it is?  It's
too beautiful to sit in the garden.  Do you not see that the sun shines on
everything?  You know we are poor, mother; and if it was not for the town
we shouldn't know what a fine thing it is to see the sun shining, and the
sky so blue, and the flowers so beautiful.  If it was not for that, I
could be happy; but when I look at those things I don't know what to say.
They are so beautiful, they make me ashamed of being poor."

"Oh, daughter," replied the mother, "you speak in such a strange way.  What
do you mean?"

"It seems to me," said the girl, "as if you said that we might not see how
beautiful the sun was and the sky, and the flowers, and the grass, and the
trees, and the brooks, and the trees, and the stars, if it was not for the
town.  Now you see what I mean.  The town makes everything good, and
everything beautiful.  There are no clouds.  There is no sun, or no sky,
or no flowers, or no trees, or no brooks, or no cows, or no geese.  There
are no cows, because cows eat grass.  There is no grass because cows eat
it.  And I say that, if it wasn't for the town, you wouldn't see what a
fine thing it is to have cows.  There are no clouds because there is no
sky.  There are no stars, because they cannot be seen.  There is no sun,
because there are no cows.  There are no flowers because cows eat them.
There are no brooks, because cows drink them.  There are no trees, because
cows eat them.  There are no stars, because cows eat them.  There are no
flowers, because cows eat them.  There are no clouds because there is no

are no flowers, because cows eat them.  There are no stars because cows
eat them.  There is no sun, because there are no cows.  There is no sky,
because cows eat the sky.  There are no clouds because there is no sky.
There is no sun because there is no sky.  There is no sky because there are
no clouds.  There are no flowers because cows eat them.  There are no
brooks because cows drink them.  There are no trees because cows eat them.
There are no cows because there are no clouds.  There are no stars because
there is no sky.  There are no brooks because cows drink them.  There are
no trees because cows eat them.  There are no flowers because cows eat
them.  There are no clouds because there is no sky.  There is no sun
because there are no cows.  There is no sky because there are no cows.
There are no flowers because cows eat them.  There are no brooks because
cows drink them.  There are no trees because cows eat them.  There are no
stars because there is no sky.  There is no sun because there are no cows.
There is no sky because there are no clouds.  There is no sun because there
are no cows.  There is no sky because there are no clouds.  There are no
brooks because cows drink them.  There are no trees because cows eat them.
There are no flowers because cows eat them.  There is no sky because there
is no sun.  There is no sun because there are no cows.  There is no sky
because there are no clouds.  There are no cows because there is no sky."

The mother laughed.  "That's a strange way of talking," she said.  "What do
you mean?"

"That's what I mean," said the girl, "when I speak of those things.  The
things that make everything beautiful are not the things that are.  The
things that make everything beautiful are the things that are not.  There
is no sun because there is no sky.  There are no cows because there is no
sky.  There are no flowers because there are no cows.  There are no
