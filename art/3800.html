Last year, VHS released its follow-up full-length, “The Great Laugh,” which is now streaming via Bandcamp.

A quick word about this record from the band:

"In a recent review by The Onion's AV Club, they described the record as having an “air of melancholy,” and after a long year of touring we agree that our newest record is an honest depiction of what life has been like for us over the past few years. From recording it to releasing it, we knew it would be full of melancholy, anger and hope. The Great Laugh is our response to those feelings."

VHS’ upcoming full-length, as the band says, is a "record of resilience" and "encapsulates our growth from being a band who just had songs and wanted to get them out into people’s hands to become a band with a full touring schedule and a whole lot of miles logged."

The band is also currently playing in a collaborative project with The Dirty Heads called “The Super Furry Animals Vs The Dirty Heads.”

See VHS live when they come through San Antonio on Friday, June 2, in support of the recently released “The Great Laugh.” Tickets are $15. RSVP.

San Antonio Rodeo 2018

The San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo will continue to give more and more people a chance to buy tickets and experience this festival. However, the cost is continuing to rise and the lines continue to grow longer. There are a number of reasons for this, but the biggest of them is a lack of parking, which has to do with a massive increase in attendees.

The people behind the event have put in a lot of time to ensure that they can make this a wonderful experience for anyone who attends, but the parking shortage and lack of rideshare and Lyft drivers continue to make it more difficult.

The San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo should come up with a plan that includes better transportation for those who come to enjoy the fun that the Rodeo offers in the city. One way they could do this is by partnering with Lyft and other ride sharing services, as well as adding a few more shuttle services, to help alleviate the parking issues and make it easier for those who want to attend and participate.

There is a great Rodeo that takes place in August, and you need to attend it, as it has all of the best and most notable rodeo performers and the most famous livestock, such as the world famous horses who have shown in the event for years. However, with the parking problems, the rideshare and rideshare driver shortage and other issues, it is difficult to see how all of these events can take place at the same time. You have to pick your poison and go with the best of your options, which could include parking or the availability of a few cars that you can use.

Once you have chosen a rodeo, you need to plan how you will attend it so that it won’t be crowded with other events. You also need to plan in advance and make sure that you will make it to the events on time, so that you can plan your weekend around everything that is taking place.

There is more than one rodeo in the city that takes place on a Friday night. This is important because many people like to come out and spend the evening with their families and friends to see how their rodeo favorites are doing and interact with them.

If you decide to go to the rodeo, make sure that you arrive early and set aside time for a good amount of time to get there, because you may have to wait in lines, get a Rideshare for a long time or deal with traffic issues due to the large volume of people in the area.

See Rodeo in San Antonio in August 2018. Tickets go on sale in June and are available online or at your local San Antonio outlet.

We are looking forward to the Rodeo taking place at the historic Hemisfair Park and enjoying the music, comedy and other events that you can attend that weekend.

June 14-15

San Antonio Book Festival

The South Texas Book Festival is the largest book festival in Texas, taking place in both San Antonio and Austin. The Book Festival takes place in multiple locations in San Antonio for the last three weekends of June, with San Antonio’s events taking place this weekend.

This event has a large number of attendees, so you need to be prepared for the number of people coming to the San Antonio Book Festival if you want to be able to visit and enjoy all of the events without experiencing any traffic problems.

The South Texas Book Festival has hosted literary and musical performances for the past 29 years, and in doing so has increased the number of authors that they host and showcase. Their events have now expanded to also include the performing arts.

The festival has included the addition of an opening performance by The San Antonio Symphony, the performance of Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake” ballet by the Ballet de San Antonio and performances by the Opera Company of San Antonio.

The festival has become one of the best in the country, so you need to visit it to experience all of the new activities that will be taking place and all of the events that you can expect to see.

See San Antonio’s South Texas Book Festival. The festival goes on sale in May and tickets are available online or at the San Antonio outlets.

June 14-16

San Antonio Film Festival

San Antonio’s film festival takes place over two weekends this month. The event has more than 40 movies and 20 international premieres. The festival always takes place over two weekends because it takes some time to review the festival films and figure out which are going to be shown in order to create a schedule that is appealing to as many people as possible.

This event is an important part of the film industry in Texas and is a big draw for the film industry in this area. If you want to attend the San Antonio Film Festival and see a selection of the best films that this city has to offer, you need to book tickets soon.

There are also a number of parties and events that go on in the area, and the films have their own parties that bring the film fans together for fun and events that highlight the films that will be shown. The festival can fill your heart with joy and leave you so happy that you were able to see what this city has to offer.

See San Antonio's San Antonio Film Festival. Tickets are available on May 7.

June 14-21

San Antonio Pride

The San Antonio Gay Pride Festival happens in June, and this year, it takes place from June 14-21. This event is unique, and not every city can boast of an event like this. There are thousands of people in attendance and many activities to keep everyone entertained.

This event takes place across a number of venues and in different locations. Some are inside of the city, but the majority of them are outside of the city and in other areas of the city. People are treated to a number of great activities that will help you get to know the people of San Antonio more than you did before.

If you love San Antonio, you need to plan your schedule around this event and make sure that you don’t miss out on any of the activities, because there are always some that you don’t want to miss out on.

This event is also one of the most dangerous to attend, as the high heels can often lead to stumbling and people being in pain. For those who don’t take the event seriously, a lot of accidents can be had during this event. To avoid this, go to a san Antonio pride location that you know is safe and comfortable to walk in.

The San Antonio Prides usually take place the last weekend in June or</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:54:02
