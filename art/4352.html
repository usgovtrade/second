Everest College is a private, for-profit career college located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It is a subsidiary of Everest College Inc., a non-profit organization operating more than twenty universities and colleges in the United States.

History 
Everest College (formerly Calgary Community College) was founded in 1968 and moved into its current facilities in 1972. The first president of the institution was William Keebler, former director of the Institute of Professional Education in California. Calgary Community College offered its first English and Business diplomas in 1974. The institution was purchased by Everest College (formerly Harcourt College) in 1981.

As part of the merger with Everest College, a college was established for each program of study. The college structure has been in place since then. Everest College changed its name from Calgary Community College in 2016.

Academics 

The college has over 300 full-time programs available in the following disciplines: Accounting, Administrative Assistant, Business, Child Care, Dental Assisting, Graphic Design, Medical Laboratory Technician, Music Industry, Office Administration, Pre-Vocational, Professional Office Assistant, Human Services and Residential Care Worker.

The college offers both diplomas and certificates of completion. Degrees are offered through partnerships with the University of Calgary, Mount Royal University and NorQuest College. In addition to these schools, bachelor's degrees are also available through the University of Lethbridge. The university also offers a number of other professional certificates and diplomas. The main focus of the programs is on job readiness.

Everest College also provides Continuing Education courses for career enhancement and personal growth, which can be attended on a full-time, part-time, or evening basis.

Accreditation
The college is nationally accredited by Canadian Council for Private Education, the Association of Private Career Colleges (APCC), and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). In 2015, the two-year certificate program in the Human Resources Management and Recruitment Management programs were approved to be eligible for registration by the Institute of Continuing Education and Training (ICET) certification by Professional Development Schools.

Campus 
The facilities of Everest College consist of two buildings: the main building and a new addition. The main building houses the administrative offices, library, a small store, chapel, classrooms, an open computer lab and administrative offices. The addition consists of three large classrooms, four smaller classrooms, a lecture hall, a business skills lab and more administrative offices. The college also owns a full-time Child Development Centre and a full-time Dental Assistant Centre, both located in southwest Calgary.

The college is located near the Calgary Golf & Country Club.

Degree programs 
Everest College offers part-time and full-time diploma, certificate and degree programs at locations throughout Alberta.
