## Stonehenge

50 miles northwest of Bath.

#### Getting Here and Around

About 18 miles north of Bath, a signposted turnoff leads from the A36 to the stones. It's 3 miles east of Amesbury on a small winding road. Once you arrive, it is best to leave your car behind and use the regular train or bus service (traveline.info), or a taxi.

### Exploring

Fodor's Choice | Stonehenge.  
These mysterious monoliths have drawn visitors for 5,000 years. An avenue of stones—the Heel Stone, Altar Stone, Slaughter Stone, and Healer's Chair—leads up to the main trilithon gate, where pillars of megalithic lintels stand guard on either side. In the center, the lintel stones form two huge, facing arches, the lintels of which are decorated with the carvings of two trilithons. Beyond the main trilithon is the enormous Trilithon Horseshoe, part of which is missing, and the Slaughter Stone, thought to have been used for ritualistic slaughter. At the center of the horseshoe is the Altar Stone. The smaller stones, which make up the Cove, the Lesser Cove, and the Bluestone Horseshoe, lie mostly in front of the great trilithons. The Bluestone Horseshoe is thought to have formed part of a circular processional route. In 2010, archaeologists discovered a ring of 56 pits hidden under the modern tarmac and approaches—perhaps used as part of a prehistoric cremation or burial site. As to the origins of Stonehenge, recent research suggests that the builders arrived in Britain from Europe rather than from Africa as once believed.

Near the road's southern end are the impressive Heel Stone and the even older, still mysterious Altar Stone. From this vantage point, which has sweeping views over Salisbury Plain, you can see the smaller bluestone horseshoe—also known as the Heelers—joining the bluestones to the trilithon lintels. A bit farther west is the huge circular Horseshoe Circle, which originally enclosed the trilithons. Within the circle are two concentric rings of stones, called the Lesser Circles. The South Circle has 23 stones, and the North Circle has 28. Although these stones are very worn, their positions are clearly marked. At the center of the circle, the enormous, fallen Trilithon Horseshoe was left after centuries of plunder by visitors and archaeologists alike. Stonehenge is one of Britain's most ancient and famous sites and is known throughout the world. | Alton, on A303 and A344 | 08707/333438 | www.english-heritage.org.uk | Free; car park £10.

## Avebury

45 miles south of Stonehenge, 40 miles west of Salisbury, 19 miles southwest of Bath.

Avebury is Britain's largest stone circle, and one of its oldest. People have lived in this area for more than 6,000 years, and archaeologists have found evidence of settlements dating to Neolithic times. On the rolling Salisbury Plain are a series of stone circles and other ancient earthworks that are the legacy of the people who lived here 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. The stones are huge: the largest is known as Silbury Hill, after the nearby village, and is the only surviving artificial mound in the country.

#### Getting Here and Around

For drivers, the site is 45 miles south of Salisbury. From Salisbury take the A345 to Devizes and pick up signs for Avebury. The village is signposted off the A4135 and the B3081 near Shaftesbury. On public holidays from May to September, parking can be difficult; however, there are lots of spots by the side of the road.

### Exploring

Fodor's Choice | Avebury Stone Circle.  
Ancient Britain's most famous stone circle lies in a field in the village of Avebury, just southwest of Salisbury. You can pick up a map of the site at the information center in the village, next to the shop. The stones are more than 1,000 feet around and weigh an estimated 1½ million tons. No one knows for certain how many stones are here, but about 80 have been counted so far. The largest (called the "inner circle"), in the center, weighs an estimated 40 tons. The biggest stone, the so-called "capstone" (there are two) weighs about 16 tons; their removal will have changed the alignment of the circle.

Avebury, known as the "Village of Silbury," has a long and important history, with at least seven monumental stone circles, as well as barrows and standing stones. For some years now a modern reconstruction of the village has been in progress. Among the findings from excavations at the village are fragments of an earthen ditch that encircled the settlement. The ditch was constructed after the stone circle was erected, perhaps because it served a defensive purpose. You can see the ditch from the road. An interpretation center displays historical exhibits on various phases of prehistoric settlement. Some visitors walk from the village through fields, but it's a very uneven 4-mile walk, especially in wet weather. The site is open daily. An admission fee of £7.50 is charged. | A4 | Avebury | 0870/333–1181 | www.nationaltrust.org.uk | £7.50; grounds only £5.50 | Daily 9–dusk.

## Longleat

31 miles west of Avebury, 21 miles southwest of Salisbury.

Set in expansive grounds, the ancestral seat of the Marquess of Bath, Longleat House (a grand stately home since the 1700s) is famous for its extensive collection of tapestries, armor, paintings, and other priceless treasures, including the world's largest private collection of stuffed animals. After your tour of the house, you can indulge in some of the activities that bring in a fraction of Longleat's income—a day's falcon</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:38
