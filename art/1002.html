The Red Balloon - A Monster in the Closet and The Monster at the End of This Book. 2. The Rainbow Fish. 3. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. 4. The Twits. 5. The Gruffalo. 6. The Fuzzy Dice.

Children often like the same book over and over again. Some parents find this behaviour annoying and don't understand it. This post is not about why children love the same books over and over again; it is about how this trait can be used to help children with reading.

For example, instead of reading any book all over again, the child can read from one book from a different series from the same publisher. If a child enjoys reading the Twits, he can choose another children's book from the same series published by the same company; this way the child will build a stronger affinity for the characters in the children's books. Readers in this category will be much more likely to read and like The Gruffalo instead of The Crooked House. This applies to all age groups, not just 5 year olds. In fact, with older children, the ability to recognize and remember particular characteristics of characters can make it easier to understand stories in a completely different genre or era.

Children in the above category might like the experience of reading multiple books from the same series, but once the child's interest in that series has been developed, he or she will want to start reading from another series or from different companies altogether.

Reading to build up the desire to read more is similar to how one develops a taste for coffee, tea, wine, chocolate, meat, bread, or anything else: one doesn't need a lot of exposure to it to develop a preference, but it does help to have enjoyed it before. By reading good children's books to your child, you may increase his or her reading enjoyment and enthusiasm.

3. Reading to your child increases self-confidence

Your child might want to watch cartoons instead of reading, or he might want to play computer games instead of reading. As parents, you might encourage him to do this or give him every chance you can to do what he wants to do, but as far as you're concerned, reading is a vital component of your child's education and mental development. When you read to your child, you show him that you believe he can do something, or that you support his efforts, even though he is unable to do it yet. You show him that you are on his side. This will help your child develop confidence in the ability to accomplish something when he feels that you are willing to go with him in his endeavours. It will boost his self-esteem. This is a positive consequence to reading, as well as an example of how reading is not about learning how to read but also about developing the skill of reading with your child.

4. Reading promotes a great environment for learning

When you read to your child, it also promotes creativity. You might ask your child questions about the book you are reading or you might tell him a story that is part of the book he's reading. This is the most effective way to use reading as an educational tool because the exchange of information between you and your child helps strengthen his ability to work with written language. You might read The Princess and the Pea or The Day the Crayons Came Home, and discuss the questions and ideas in those books, which will help your child to see the value of writing and reading. Reading can make learning to read easier. When he sees how important reading is, your child will want to learn how to read.

5. Reading at home builds strong relationships

With most children's books, the message is that parents are the first people in the home to read to children and, usually, to make sure the message of the book is understood. The books will not only teach children to read, but also to listen and be respectful and cooperative when you are reading to them. Reading will be one of the most important family rituals for your child to learn in order to have a lifetime of reading enjoyment and a great many positive experiences with books.

This is the kind of book that will create a strong bond between you and your child. The stories are interesting and funny, the characters are unique and real, and there is a great deal of creative writing involved. This gives you an excellent opportunity to express yourself, as well as to be creative, while spending time with your child.

It also builds up your child's love of reading. The more books your child reads, the more he will enjoy reading, and the more interested he will be in reading more books. This increases the chance that your child will want to read for pleasure after he graduates from high school, and that he will be enthusiastic and excited to start learning how to read.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:18
