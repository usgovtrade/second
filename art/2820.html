I have done a small review of the models I was sent. (I will not sell these and just have them on my hard drive)
The models are all 100% hand made and built in Blender. All models are complete as you will find them with no additional parts required.
Each model comes in 3 formats
Blender format:
3ds Max format:
Wavefront (.obj) format:

I plan to work on the site more later. I have had many people ask me for help building their 3d bait website. I got tired of helping and now have made it so you guys can do it easily. I know building a 3d bait site is hard to do and there is always something new to learn. It really can not be done with cheap templates and other free items.
I have spent over a year developing this site and the website takes everything I know about 3D models and brings it all together into one website. You will not be able to get what you see here anywhere else.
The site is very easy to use and even helps you to build a blog.
The site also offers many features that will help you with your 3D bait site. These features will make managing your site easier. You can download my full feature list at the link below:
http://www.anybait.com/en/downloads/3d_models_website_features.zip

I noticed many of the sites you have all used to build your 3d bait website used a template.
http://www.anybait.com/en/downloads/3d_models_website_templates.zip
Using a template is fine for a simple site. But any real 3d bait site will never be simple. So how do you build a 3d bait site if it requires you to learn 3d software and is very hard to do with cheap templates and other free items.
Many of the templates from other sites are free and you will find some free templates here.
So why pay for a template. Most of them are not very good and a lot of them contain many ads. I can tell you from experience that using a template is not as easy as it may look. It is really hard to get your site where you want it to be. But it gets worse. Often times you will find that the template maker wants your money if you want to update the site to work with more latest version of 3d bait sites.
I hate to tell you that most templates are not going to be updated by the template maker if you get stuck. So there is really nothing you can do with these templates if you don’t want to pay.
I also found a lot of the templates to not be very fast. My server gets hammered so some of the templates made it really hard to do what I wanted to do.
I built the site you see here and I did not use a template.
What I did was to create a 3d bait website template that can be used easily and that is not overpriced like a lot of the templates I found.
Please download this site from below

You can also download the templates that came with it here from below.

Since I am not a template maker and I have found out what people want in their 3d bait website, I put together this template. It has many features to make it easy to use. You can also add your own custom pages for any 3d bait website you want to create. It is called the 3d bait website template. I also have other 3d bait site templates for you to choose from. http://www.anybait.com/en/downloads/3d_models_website_template_templates.zip

3dbait.com was started when I wanted to learn how to make and build my own site. I was not into web design then and wanted to try it on my own. Since I have always been interested in fishing I found it easy to use this site to design my own 3d bait site. Since this was my first website I did not have many tools so it was very slow to create the site.
I use Dreamweaver and found it very hard to use because of how it made my computer run. Dreamweaver was slowing my computer to a crawl and made it difficult to see the 3d bait site I was making. So I made it easy for me to learn how to build a 3d bait site by removing Dreamweaver. Now I use the newest version of a tool called Bluefish. It is a wonderful tool that makes it easy to build my site with out having the need for expensive Dreamweaver. You can even build a 3d bait site for free from Bluefish. I am also building a tutorial using Bluefish. I just have to get it finished before posting it on this site.
I am not very good at this and I have a short attention span. This is why I want you to be able to build your own 3d bait site easily. Many people like myself who are not good at this want to build their own 3d bait site.
If you want to build a 3d bait site or you know how to and would like to make one. This site is great for you. But I do not want to spend a lot of money on a few plugins or on templates. I want to make it easy for you to build your own 3d bait site without spending a lot of money. I also make sure it works with your computer. This is why I use Bluefish which is free software for your computer. And I also use WordPress as my backend. This makes it easy for anyone to build their own 3d bait site.
The site is still under development and I am looking for more people to help to improve it. I would like you to help improve the site and add your own content. If you find the site useful and think you could contribute to make it better, please send me a message at anybait@

This 3d bait website offers some of the most unique features found anywhere. It is made by me and I made it simple for anyone to build their own 3d bait site. It is based on Bluefish software.
3dbait.com has many great features that will make anyone’s site faster. If you find this site interesting, I would appreciate your help in building it. You can make your site much faster and even add some amazing 3d bait site content if you decide to help me out.
I would also like to hear from you what features you would like to see in the future. I would love to see this 3d bait website get even better.

This site is simple and will allow you to create 3d bait websites fast. I want to help my fellow fisherman and make it easy for them to use this tool.
