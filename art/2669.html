Amber's first single "Stronger" is a song about perseverance, surviving difficult times. "I could be wrong, but there's a line that says 'you may fall in time.' Some people are gonna find themselves in a bad position. I thought that would be such a good metaphor for the times we're in."

Amber said she is grateful for the opportunity she had to perform at the Women’s March last month in Nashville, TN. “There were people from all walks of life and there’s just something in the air that you can’t help but feel so connected to everyone who is there. You become excited because you know everybody is on the same team, cheering for the same thing."

I really enjoyed this interview. Amber's first record is outstanding and a testimony of how much God is able to do in our lives. I love it when music points back to the Gospel, giving praise and glory to God. It has a great message for all people no matter how old they are, or where they are from, or what they do. I'm glad to hear that someone of her quality has chosen to go down this path and is able to share it through her music and witness.

It's great to see such talented artists share what they are walking through because it's a blessing for so many of us who are not in that same position. I agree with Amber that God uses things for good in our lives.
I loved watching her new video, "Stronger" and look forward to her future.
Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed reading Amber's testimony about the struggles she had with her previous record. However, now that I have seen her current video (Stronger) and read about her new "stronger" story, I am convinced that God has used this for His glory.
This is truly a great example of how God moves throughout a situation to bring good things, even in the midst of suffering.
Thank you for your insight, Amber, and for bringing your music to our community. We are so blessed to have someone like you representing our country.

Thank you, Amber for sharing your testimony and song! This song will speak to the hurting hearts of so many people, myself included. I feel like God is speaking to me so loudly in this song... "Hold On" ...and that's something I need to continue to remember...hold on. Thanks Amber!

Saw her in concert this past Saturday, and she was amazing! Great lyrics, and a powerful performance. I love it when there are two parts to the song, the beginning and then the end. God gave Amber such talent, and she used it so well to minister to us. We are so blessed to have such talent here in our country. :)

I was very much moved to hear her story behind the song "Stronger" . I went to listen to her second album "Runaway' which was the title of her first album at age ten. I've got the new record "Stronger" at my door. I'm looking forward to hearing her song Stronger . Her story was very inspiring. God is working in Amber's life and will work through her songs to bring the Gospel to the nation. Thank you Amber

What a great song! It is hard to live when your dreams are taken from you and left only for you to feel helpless and not capable of accomplishing them again. God gives you many different things in life that help you to stay positive, hope, and keep pressing forward. God has a plan for you, even if your plans have been changed.
God has a beautiful purpose for each of us, and I am blessed for the trials and lessons in my life, as well as the gifts that He's given me. We all have different stories and experiences that God uses to reach many people.

The song "Stronger" was a song I really needed to hear. We are in an amazing time of transition for our country, and I felt that so many people were going through times of personal weakness and feeling discouraged. I am praying that many of the lessons God has taught me through this hard time in our country can be turned into a ministry to help others find the strength and resolve they need to fight the good fight. Thanks Amber!

Amber I love your testimony and the way that it shows God's hand in your life. I was touched and inspired that even though things were bad you have been able to show that God does indeed work and that He can take what the devil meant for evil and use it for good. You are a voice for many with a beautiful gift. I praise God for you and am so blessed to know you through your music. My husband and I love listening to you. God will continue to use you for His glory and to do good. Congratulations on your upcoming album.

Thanks for reading my testimony, and for your comment. I appreciate you listening to my music and following along on my blog. God is so amazing! As someone who is passionate about music, I am thankful for God's plan for me and how He has used me in such a beautiful way. God has given me the gift of music to be able to speak to people of all different ages and backgrounds, from different parts of the country. I am able to share my testimony with them through my songs, by sharing my experiences and journey with God. I am so thankful for God's call on my life, and His calling others to join me on this journey in the ministry of music. I hope that God continues to use me to glorify Him as I minister to people of all ages, because He uses me to minister the Gospel to so many.

I have a long history of depression and other mental illnesses. I find that when you get something like depression and anxiety you become isolated. Nobody wants to talk about the things they're going through. In fact, I didn't really want to talk about my mental illnesses until about a year ago. It is the same for the current president. He is surrounded by many of his enemies, and they are just waiting to hurt him. I want to stand up and support him, just like I want to stand up and support Trump and what he is doing.

You bring an important point to this situation. There are people out there who would love to see Trump fail and if we take the time to listen we can hear it in their words. If we are not careful, we will become part of the problem instead of a solution. There are no good guys out there who oppose Trump in his efforts to put America first. As a Christian, I believe that Jesus is our solution, and the only true God and savior of the world. I believe that Jesus will always work for good, and that He wants all people to have happiness and to have their lives made more productive. He does not want anyone to suffer, even if you do not deserve it. He also does not want people to suffer in loneliness. He wants us to turn to Him as a friend and listen to what He is saying to us. One way or the other, He is leading us through his love for all of us.

I am truly blessed by the Lord. I was so blessed by Trump's speech in Pensacola. It is a pleasure to read your comments. I agree with you and want to thank you for them. God is so good to give people the strength to say what is in their heart. God bless you.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:52
