According to vocalist Brent Smith:

Shinedown recently released the follow-up to 2013's self-titled effort, with "Don't Say a Word."

With the follow-up, Smith had this to say:

"With this record, I've really felt comfortable in the record room and with all of our producers and writers and engineers. It feels very authentic and was very creative. It also has a big, expansive sound that people are gonna love.

"We really wanted to make the record where everybody who listens to it from the first guitar note on the album can feel every single part of the emotion of the songs. From the first track to the last track, it's going to create a big impact. It's everything I wanted and more."

Smith will remain on the road this fall while Shinedown is heading out on another run of U.S. dates. The band will soon follow up with a month-long run of tour dates in Europe.

We can't wait to hear the new album, and the upcoming album will be in stores on September 23rd. The album was recorded by Shinedown, with David Bendeth as their producer. In addition, Ed Cash contributed production and co-production on the effort. It's pretty great news that a new album is ready for the world. We've been waiting and really waiting for this one to arrive. It's about time. The album follows Shinedown's self-titled effort released back in 2013.

Shinedown has posted a second new song titled "Don't Say Anything About My Mom." You can listen to it by clicking the song title and then previewing it in the YouTube window below. The song was just released on iTunes, where you can buy it for your iPhone, iPad, or iPod.

"This is a song that is going to resonate with a lot of people," Brent Smith explains in the video below.

"But this song is about people who have very high standards for themselves, like Brent's daughter," adds Mark Bass. "And we felt it was very important that if she saw her dad on TV and all these people were talking about him, that he give her a heads up before that happened and let her know."

"It's a lot of that that I went through," Smith goes on to say. "A lot of people who get wrapped up in bands or rock stars and get in this mode of worshipping them, trying to meet the stars and all these expectations, and then when they don't, it's this giant shock to the system, and then you find out some of their dirty secrets. And you're like, 'Well, I guess that's just what a person like that is.' So I wrote a song about all that."

You can buy it for your mobile device by clicking on the video below. The new song can be purchased at iTunes here.

This one goes out to all the ladies,
So just don't say anything about my mom.
And whatever your dad has left
You won't find out about it here.
Don't be late for school or the bus
I'll give you a ride, and I'll be on time, yes, yes.

No, I don't know if you're the one
You'd be like the sun to me, and I don't want to be alone, and I don't want to be alone.
Yes, I've never felt like this,
But it's been the feeling I've been searching for.

Don't say anything about my mom
Don't say anything about my mom.
Your momma looks a lot like mine
We're about the same age, yeah, that's why I know we're kindred souls.

The more you try to hide it from me
It's so obvious you're trying to hide it from me, yeah.
Your feelings run deep inside you
And you don't even realize it.
I'll never hurt you, baby, not ever.

Don't say anything about my mom,
Don't say anything about my mom,
Just don't say anything about my mom,
Don't say anything about my mom.

The lyrics for "Don't Say Anything About My Mom" are below.

"This song is a very important song to the band, and it was very special to me because of my mom," shares Brent Smith. "This song was the first one we put out, actually, so I took it very seriously."

"We want to say thank you to everyone who has been with us and we appreciate you and your support," Smith adds.

"This song is about being authentic to yourself and being true to yourself, but that can be very challenging because a lot of people can get in your business and tell you not to do it," Smith continues. "This song also speaks to the situation of someone who is trying to hide something, as well as the conflict of the situation where you are completely in love with the love of your life and you don't want to be away from them. So it's all about that duality of being honest to yourself and being able to share with that person you love, and that's kind of a struggle."
