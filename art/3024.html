What impresses most about him, however, are his eyes.

When he’s not playing sports, he’s likely playing Minecraft, a PC game in which the player constructs structures out of various blocks. In the game, people also often create “buildings” out of their own houses. He’s been seen hanging out in his house and his yard to play Minecraft with his friends.

“When we go to the beach, I build a little house,” he said. “When I get bored, I just build the house. I like to just kind of leave the blocks up so I can check them later. I like doing that.”

His father joked that the most likely thing for him to be doing in his future is “a homeowner or owning a car wash.”

There is something about Makenzie, though, that makes him unique.

“He doesn’t want to play sports,” David said. “He wants to play Minecraft.”
