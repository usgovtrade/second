the Romans themselves could not bear to see them; for, in answer
to a question put to them by the consuls, regarding the policy of
transferring the conquered to other lands, they answered that they
should not take that course, if any other way offered of gaining
an honourable end by that mode of terminating a war.  Caius Lutatius
Catulus said to Cneius Piso, "Have you not yet learnt that in
other states, and among the Hellenes too, the name of Roman is a
term of disgrace?"  Upon the same occasion, in reply to the proposal
to take the Carthaginians into their own service and enfranchise
them, Servilius Geminus, when asked what he had to say, made answer
thus:  "I have heard some individuals speak in favour of it; but
even if it should prove in the end a profitable speculation, I am
not willing to believe that the gods ought to be taken into service
and enfranchised as a mere business speculation." But the greatest
proof of the unpopularity of this proposal is found in the case
of the Achaeans, who, according to the will of the Achaean League,
were transferred to the Roman province, by a decree of the Achaean
Council. A very strong case this, when one sees that the Achaean
people themselves did not approve of their transfer; for in other
cases their resolutions were disregarded by the Roman magistrates,
when they thought them unprofitable. But this resolution was
regarded by them as so much more opposed to the interests of Rome,
that they thought it their duty, even at the cost of life and
property, to endeavour to frustrate it. But if the Romans thought
that those citizens had a right to be transferred who were of the
same stock, why, pray, did they not apply the same principle to
themselves? Did they, when the Carthaginians were transferred to
themselves, take the Carthaginians into their own service, or only
those of the same stock as themselves?  It was to the interest
of the Carthaginians to preserve the friendship of the Romans,
and that of the Romans to be on terms of good understanding with
the Carthaginians; for that was the only road to securing peace.
Therefore the Romans had good grounds for transferring the Carthaginians
to themselves. The Carthaginians also could not preserve their own
peace without the assistance of the Romans; consequently that was
a matter of greater importance than would be the peace of Rome
without the friendship of the Carthaginians. There was a difference
too in the case of the Carthaginians; for they were in a position
to gain from the friendship of the Romans, whilst the Romans had
to gain from the friendship of the Carthaginians. That was the reason
why the Carthaginians and the Romans entered into alliance against
Philip, who had invaded Sicily, as also against the Sardinians,
the former being an ally of the Romans and the latter of Philip.
And it was on these grounds that the Roman general, when he took
up his command against the Sardinians, told them that they must
not only continue to be allies to him and the Romans, but they
must also go so far as to give up the Carthaginians as well as
Philip to him.

[B.C. 201 (_a. u_. 711)]

[-35-] When the Romans had made their decision regarding the exchange
of prisoners, they appointed their commanders and tribunes, as usual,
and assigned quarters for each of them. A short time elapsed before
Geminius was sent out against the Gauls, whom, as he was now on
good terms with the state, he did not hesitate to attack. The other
emperor, who had recently been designated, was named Veturius. The
envoys from the Sicilians arrived at Rome; but, as they could
not prevail on the praetors to hear them, because the praetors were
in their camp with the army, they were dismissed without any answer,
save that they should be re-elected a second time. However, even
before the election a proclamation of recall had been sent out to
the colonies on the Capitol, and that was done with such promptness
that many who were even in their own houses when they received the
message came forth immediately on hearing it. When Veturius, too,
learnt that an order had been issued for the appointment of another
emperor, he sent to say that he would resign the appointment if
he were not confirmed by the Senate. But when the latter sent him
a written answer as a man who had been sent to them to govern the
state, he withdrew his resignation and departed.

[-36-] After this appointment Geminius returned to the army at the
call of the praetor Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus, and took the field
against the Gauls. He subdued them partly by force and partly by
negotiation, and they became in consequence subject to the Roman
people. There was great rejoicing throughout the city, on account
of which they thought that the war against the Gauls was finished;
but just then, being disappointed of their hopes in regard to the
Macedonians, they had hopes that, after Geminius' return, war would
be resumed against the Gauls. Accordingly Gnaeus Manlius Vulso,
who was sent out with the praetor Marcus Postumius by the senate
in accordance with the decree of the people, declared that he had
come out with the sole object of taking the war with the Gauls
into his own hands. The Gauls had also sent ambassadors to Rome,
but to no effect.

[-37-] When these were out of the way, the envoys from the Sicilians
arrived; for some had come to Rome, and others from them. There
were in all nearly eight hundred; but they had been detained, so
to speak, at Larissa, as they could not be admitted to Rome by
reason of the consul. At length, when the praetor took possession
of his post, having arranged things as follows, the Sicilians made
their appearance. The praetor had received and taken on oath a large
number of representatives from among the Sicilians. The envoys
came at first with only a few friends; but, as the Romans appeared
eager to listen to them, the remainder followed as they were admitted.
Their spokesman was Gelo. After a short time the consul appeared,
as if he would address the praetor, but not venturing to do so openly,
he stepped into a neighbouring house. Now Gelo was well aware that
he was being insulted, and he made an open attempt to compel his
dismissal. But since in this act he displayed much more passion
than dignity, a crowd had gathered round the consul, who, when
Gelo raised a hue and cry, turned his back on him and departed.
The envoys then complained at length to the consul of their being
treated so disgracefully, and stated what had happened and begged
that he should intervene. The consul acknowledged that his colleague
had shown disrespect to them and to the Romans, and asked to be
excused on account of illness. The envoys, when they had learned
this answer, went to see the consul, and explained their cause of
grief at greater length than before, and declared that there was
no state in the world where they would be so insulted as in that
of Rome; but the consul was in no frame of mind to listen to them.
He therefore ordered them to depart; and, when they refused to
do so, dismissed them without their obtaining anything. [-38-] At
this Gelo, being angry, said that not only were they dismissed but
they were also forbidden ever to see him again. He therefore, in
order that the senate might hear of it, summoned one of the praetors
to meet him, and bade him write a letter to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,
dictator, in which he declared that he did not regard it as anything
short of an insult for a commander of a Roman legion to be denied
admission into the city by its magistrates, if, even at Rome,
and in their own house, he had been treated with such discourtesy;
and if the consul, though sick, had gone forth to meet them, he
had been insulted, since no one was allowed to come near them except
the praetor, and he ought to have made the consul come out himself
with his hands raised, had the latter so wished. They were therefore
to summon their ambassadors and convey them to the dictator. The
latter expressed indignation over the insult, and promised that he
would call a meeting of the senate and order the consul to receive
his colleagues. Accordingly, when they came into the senate he addressed
the consul in a moderate tone, and ordered him</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:44
