But he never had a chance. He was met with two beady eyes, big yellow teeth and a loud growl.The cat's teeth snapped shut on Quiggly’s right leg, sending the rabbit stumbling out of the path. Quiggly couldn’t help but squeal as he watched the feline pick up his leg in its mouth. With a swift and savage movement, it dropped the limb and set about its victim with a crunching of bones and the snap of ribs.In less than a minute, Quiggly was reduced to a pile of fur.With a loud gargle, the feline let go of his victim and spit the bones into its mouth. Then with a final shake of its head, the cat took off, dropping Quiggly’s leg bone into the woods and leaving it there to rot.Over the next few hours, the animal’s carcass slowly grew cold as it became a feast for the forest critters and their kin. In this state of suspended animation, the rabbits internal organs soon began to stink, attracting the attention of another group of animals. The vultures and skunks descended, circling, waiting for the right opportunity to begin their feast of their own.But to their disappointment, they found that Quiggly had died from an internal hemorrhage and no smell of him could be detected.They were furious.They waited for a long while as the vultures circled overhead, hovering, watching to see if the breeze could bring forth any aroma of Quiggly. And then they saw it. Quiggly’s skeleton began to move.It twitched, then the head moved, then the legs. Finally, the spine moved. All the bones began to move, twitching, moving, shifting and shaking.

Quiggly woke up as if from a long, long sleep. A few miles away, a skunk had been listening to the animals above the vultures, looking down at the dead rabbit body. He was surprised to find a large hole in the ground at the end of his scent trail. Scratching in the dirt and piling rocks over the opening, the Skunk took some food and a place to sleep nearby for the night.

Quiggly sat up, confused as to where he was, and then something cold and wet touched his nose. Startled, Quiggly jumped back. He sniffed the air to find himself nose-to-nose with a pair of red slits looking for their chance to eat him. Quiggly tried to bolt, but a second later, he was grabbed by his hind legs and pulled to the ground.

Quiggly tried his best to kick and bite, but it was useless. He was surrounded by an entire family of racoons, all trying to get at his neck. There was only one skunk left in the darkness, but he was too much for them.He jumped into the fray and pounced on Quiggly, grabbing the rabbit’s right hind leg and throwing him toward a nearby log.But just as he was about to be dragged off, a small stick on the ground was kicked up, hitting the end of his spine. And as he felt the sting, Quiggly yanked the raccoon’s tail to break free. The Skunk was stunned and for a second, his jaw hung wide open, allowing Quiggly to turn and run away.

Quiggly scrambled onto a nearby log, hiding as the Skunk emerged from the brush with his tail still bent back and out of place. He was furious that he had lost his prize and called out to the other racoons to run the rabbit down and get him back.Quiggly decided he had had enough and took his chance, diving into a neighboring bush. The raccoons, unaware of his whereabouts, gathered around the log where the Skunk held Quiggly trapped. But as he held them off, he couldn’t stop thinking about what had happened earlier with the rabbit’s dead body. It was so strange to him that he had actually been dead but now was back in the position that he had been in only hours before, when he first was attacked. He was amazed. Could he have actually gone to the afterlife? Or worse, had he come back from it? He didn’t have much time to think about it. The Skunk came crashing through the bush, screaming and searching.

Quiggly got up and ran as fast as he could, slipping on the twigs, bumping into trees, only to be stopped by a rope that went up to a tree. He looked up to see a hunter’s noose with the end wrapped around a thick branch high up. Quiggly was trapped, but in a moment of inspiration, he jumped into the noose, slipping it off the branch and around the tree to the other side of the trunk. From there, he climbed to the ground and vanished into the woods, leaving the Skunk frustrated as ever.

The next day, as the hunter got dressed for work, his dog walked over to him and scratched the rope to him. They had found Quiggly and thought he was dead.Quiggly looked at the rope and scratched it back with his feet.The rope slipped off and he was free.

“I guess there’s no hope of me getting my bunny back, is there?”

“But we saw him!” protested the dog.

“I know we did, silly! Let’s catch him and bury him!”

And so the hunt began.

An hour later, they heard a faint rustling in the leaves.They found Quiggly up a tree and tried to coax him down by waving a treat in front of him. He moved away. He didn’t want to come down. The dog jumped at Quiggly, trying to grab his hind legs, but Quiggly scampered away.The dog barked. The rabbit didn’t stop.The dog began chasing Quiggly again, but the rabbit never gave in.As the rabbit disappeared into the forest, the dog began to let out a yelp and then a scream.Quiggly was safe, but that wasn’t the end of it.The dog picked up the rabbit’s skin and ran back to the hunter with it in his mouth.When the hunter opened the door to his shack, he found a pile of dead rats and a bloody dog.

The End.

The story came out of me one night and I wrote it, finished it, and fell asleep.I was thrilled. It was one of my favorite stories I have ever made and it felt like it went well. I was proud of myself.

A month or so later, I received a letter from my niece stating that the story I made was wrong and that what really happened was that there was a guy who walked past her house and she jumped on him. So my story was a lot about raccoons and skunks, not bats and skunks.I was not happy.I was so annoyed by this. I told my sister what happened and she told me that it was her that gave me the story, so it was my fault.I was not a believer of that. I still thought I made a good story.I tried to make up an ending, but that ending turned into the same ending as the story I had wrote about the dog. I felt so upset. I told my parents, my brother and sister, and they all just told me to keep writing, that maybe it could be a happy ending or not.The story took me a couple years to write and it took so long to write. That is what I got from it all: A lesson learned, that life is not all good, it is not all bad. Everyone experiences hardships, sorrow, and happiness, but as long as you just do the best you can, good things can happen to you as well. Just because you are living in the country does not mean that you are living in poverty, or that you are living in happiness. And not just that, life is about living and moving on, as long as you leave things on the table. You don’t have to know the meaning of everything, just do your best to enjoy life for what it is and just do the best you can.

And so, I am writing to this point of my life. I cannot tell you the words I have written, but you can maybe imagine something that is beyond your imagination.I’m sure the story you can make up will be much better than mine. It is your story, not mine. I am just the one who has a story to tell. Just know that we are all small and can do only so much. We cannot change the world or life and we should not try to do so. But we can love the ones we love, and help the ones we can help, and just live. We have to move on.So far, so good.

I think to me that the author just trying to say that no one can predict the outcome of something we do. You cannot predict the future and you will not know what you will be doing and where you will be tomorrow.

I think that the writer may be looking for meaning to some kind of thing that is of the author’s imagination. But for some reason, the writer doesn’t believe that it really happens.

I think to me that the writer might be stating that he cannot decide when the first time</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:43
