Instead 
of the bright sunny day,
that we were expecting,
it became drizzly and cold
and it wasn't long before 
we were back on the boat
and off on our merry way. 
As is the case
with every tour
there were parts of the tour
that didn't go as planned,
such as poor weather.
But with any tour,
a little improvisation
goes a long way
in making for an unforgettable
and truly memorable experience.
We had the most amazing
experience at this time
on the second of our two 
private tours
with Hava Tours.
We really had a blast
and
we really enjoyed
the knowledgeable guide.
We got back to the shoreline
and
we're going to head back
for one last hike
on the North Shore
of Hawaii.
(serene music)
All right, we've reached 
the shoreline
on the second side
of Oahu's North Shore
and
this is the beach
we're going to hike to
called Kalalau Beach.
It's a very beautiful and
unspoiled beach.
If we go a little farther on
this is what's called
Ke'e Beach.
And Ke'e is also another
beautiful beach.
They are both part of the same 
beach.
(upbeat music)
So we just hiked down here
at Ke'e Beach and
we're just about to the beach
we're going to hike on now.
(serene music)
Oops, it looks like we're
picking up a little bit
of a bit of water
on our beach trip.
I wonder if the kids 
were thinking
of water play like we were
a couple of hours ago
in this beach front
at Hanauma Bay,
it's only about 30 minutes
or so drive from the pier,
which is where we've been
all of this time.
And I think they
wanted to see if
the water was warm here too.
So we just walked down
this beach here
and we'll get back
to the surfboard soon.
It's not as dangerous
as Hanauma Bay,
so we'd better be careful.
(quiet music)
That's right.
Hey, you guys,
we've just reached
this beautiful
beach which is
Kalalau Beach.
Hey, it's Kalalau,
here we are.
Look at the scenery
up here, wow!
This is the surf break
that Kalalau was named after.
(laughs)
Yeah, so the locals call it
Kalalau.
So the waves break
on the right side
and there's a little bay here
that looks like it's
full of sea life.
Just beyond that
are the mountains
which protect it and 
this is a beautiful place.
It's a beautiful beach,
there's a reef that protects it
and there are also the little
bay which we're about to go
in a little bit.
You can see the mountains 
back up the road,
so we're going to walk
through this little entrance
and see what we find.
(laughing)
I can hear you guys back
there.
All right.
(laughing)
Alright, we're back
in this little
beach area of Kalalau.
We are going to go and 
look
at a place called Pu'u O Kila,
which means a hill of ashes,
because here
it was where Kamehameha 
burned bodies of people.
What happened was, in 1819,
when the people from Hawai'i
were taken to Australia
in a ship called the 'Thames',
they left an evil chief behind
named Kame'eiamoku.
But Kamehameha wanted to
kill him because he was evil
so he came here and
tried to burn him
and he burned the whole place
that Kamehameha created
for the children.
But Kamehameha,
his dead body was left in a cave
as a place of respect.
So you can find
these little bits
of bones here, you can find
some bones here.
It has a little
underground stream here
to get to the bones.
You can feel the energy
from this place.
I want to get into a little
more of a little more
of the
underwater experience.
It's just beyond the little
beach here.
And this looks
like a great place
for a little snorkeling.
I'll start snorkeling.
(sniffles)
Whoa.
(sniffles)
Wow,
there's a little bit of a
sea critter here.
Wow, it's a little bit like
an
octopus, I think.
I'm just going to go for it
and try
and touch this little thing.
Are you good?
I know, I'm safe.
I can take some pictures here.
Whoa, look at that.
Nice.
(solemn music)
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Nice work.
Now we're in the water.
Nice, the water is warm.
We made it to the water,
a great way to start off our day
at the beach.
On the way down here 
to this beach,
we saw some
sea lions.
So let me get a little closer
so you can see them
from here.
(gentle upbeat music)
Yeah, there they are,
another fun experience 
on the tour.
We were so close
to the sea lion.
(laughs)
That's right, we
were close to the sea lion.
Look at the 
little girl out there.
The girl took a pic with the sea
lions.
Look at that, she's so cute.
She looks just like a little 
seal.
(kissing)
(tender upbeat music)
Okay, here we are.
We made it to Kalalau.
(gentle upbeat music)
There's the Kalalau
village on our right,
and I'm going to go for a swim.
(gentle music)
All right, we're off
to a nice swim.
But we're going to go 
in front of the village,
so we'll be near the little
seaside, where there's nothing.
The most you will see is the
water and the beach
on either side of the 
sandy beach.
So you've got to go in the 
shallow water
and swim out into 
the deeper water
where it's easier
to be with the kids.
In the shallow water, 
the kids can go out
a little bit and play and 
also
watch us.
But it is not a good place 
to be in the water
because of the reef
that washes up
from the back side
of the reef
and can catch you
on the reef.
So don't go that far 
out.
But it's nice to swim out
and play in the deeper water
where the surfers can 
ride
the waves.
It's a beautiful spot.
(calm music)
The waves are breaking
very nicely.
(gentle upbeat music)
Hey,
we're just having
a nice walk on this beach.
This is my favorite part,
looking down at the surfers,
looking across at the break.
(gentle music)
(sings)
(gentle music)
(waves lapping)
(serene music)
(upbeat music)
The surf is breaking
very nicely here.
We're on the right side
of the beach, here,
so it's
a small bay.
There's no great waves
that can get here
but
this is
an excellent beach to walk on
and experience the warm water
and enjoy the setting.
(dramatic music)
You know what?
We need to head back 
to the harbor and
back to the pier
to see
if the waves are right
for surfing.
Because it's an 
unprotected beach.
(gentle music)
It's not a great wave, but
it's a nice little break.
(gentle music)
(waves lapping)
(gentle music)
(waves lapping)
(gentle music)
(waves lapping)
(gentle music)
(waves lapping)
(gentle music)
(waves lapping)
(gentle music)
(waves lapping)
There you go.
(waves lapping)
(gentle music)
(waves lapping)
It's great.
We just got here, you know,
not too long ago.
We did our own walk and
checked out the beach
and now
we're done and it's time
