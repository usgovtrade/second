reduce our generation cost at this time of year.  When gas prices are high, 
our monthly generation cost increases even with decreasing actuals because we 
still have to buy the gas.  To receive the gas at index price, we need to pay 
the difference between our contract price and the gas price in order to 
receive the gas.  Consequently, our actuals go down.  The formula for this 
new method would be Index Gas price plus any difference between the Index 
price and the contract price.  This would result in a higher end calculation 
each month, but should reduce our exposure to the gas price as compared to 
purchasing at Index at the higher volume.

I think we should give this a try.  However, I will like to receive the 
customer's comments.  We have historically been on the hook for this gas 
price difference.  In addition, as we go through the winter months, we are 
typically paid back for the gas that we lose to the index price.  Please let 
me know what you think. 

Thank you,
