In an interview with WSB Radio, Epps says he knew something was up when he saw members of the A-Team wearing their traditional war paint.

‘You know they was ‘bout to kick some ass!”

According to the Daily Mail, the rapper was ordered to pay $18,000 after being found guilty of violating probation.

He’s also been ordered to complete anger management counseling as well as perform 20 hours of community service.

As part of his probation, Pipebomb must complete four months of house arrest at his Georgia home.

Pipebomb has faced legal trouble on and off for the last several years. His last arrest in 2013 resulted in a misdemeanor assault charge, the Los Angeles Times reports.

At the time, Epps pleaded no contest to “assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury” after allegedly kicking the doors of a car belonging to someone he knew.

In July 2012, he was arrested and charged with making terrorist threats and criminal threats against former girlfriend, Faith Evans, during an altercation at a party in California. He posted $100,000 bail in the matter and remained on probation for his assault case.

In 2014, he faced a misdemeanor battery charge after allegedly attacking his brother with a champagne bottle during a fight at a strip club in Atlanta.

Following the altercation, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that Epps posted a $25,000 bond and was released shortly after.

According to the AJC, Epps was arrested and charged with second degree murder last year in connection with the death of his grandmother. The charges stemmed from an investigation by DeKalb County police that began after Epps allegedly called 911 and said “the family dog had been fighting with his grandmother and killed her.” Epps was released in September 2015, but the matter was reinstated on December 12 and he was charged with involuntary manslaughter.

In February 2015, Epps pled guilty to a probation violation for failing to complete 100 hours of community service in relation to charges he racked up in the 1990s when he shot a woman and threw her off a building.

In 2003, the rapper was charged with aggravated assault and battery, along with two others, in connection to the shooting of his ex-girlfriend.

Epps was reportedly denied bail during his arraignment.

This year, the rapper appeared on The Breakfast Club where he revealed the gun he used to kill his ex-girlfriend in 1991 had been used in several other violent incidents.

“I’m still very much in disbelief and shock,” Epps said during an appearance on The Breakfast Club this week, following his release from jail on July 26. “If you say to yourself, ‘I grew up in this household, he had a gun since I was 5-years-old.’ How do you expect this person to grow out of that?”

“I’m in a place to talk about it, but I can’t get it out of my head,” he added. “And I had something to do with it. I never took that gun out of that house.”

A video of the interview surfaced online, showing the rapper explaining how he grew up with the gun and pointing it at young people in his neighborhood.

“I was a kid, a little boy, with a shotgun,” he said. “You know they’re going to come in my house, so you just point it at ‘em and you pull the trigger.”

The rapper later said he thought he’d seen a “demon” or a ghost during a fight with his girlfriend in 2000. The next morning, he discovered she had been fatally shot, he said.

Epps is the latest celebrity to be associated with the rapper’s new album, “U.G.L.E.”

Rapper Tekashi69 was previously arrested after being accused of orchestrating a shooting at the Trump Tower in December 2016.

In an Instagram post after his release, the rapper wrote: “Thanks to all my real fans who stayed by me no matter what the circumstance and all the real fans who supported me while I was away.”

Last week, rapper Chief Keef was arrested in New York after he was accused of shooting a teenager at a bowling alley.

“I don’t understand why he’s getting raps for this,” his manager, James “Chill Will” Sullivan, said. “It’s so hypocritical for the government to come and go, raid his house, then not give a f–k.”
