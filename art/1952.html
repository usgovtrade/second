I would have just taken the wife for some shopping, but the daughter...well let's just say that every time her father picked her up from school she cried...loudly. I can only imagine the tantrums she threw as soon as we entered the store.

I've tried a lot of different things when it comes to children but this one totally failed for me. By the time we left the store I wasn't exactly feeling like a supermodel.

I had a good little laugh when I told my friend about it after the fact. She just laughed and told me to give it another try...sigh.
