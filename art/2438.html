And the last one, is an ebook with 21 practical recipes you can make with minimalist ingredients and, if possible, without it!

The next one is available for preorder on Amazon and the other one is a free download.



And I also want to remind you that each month my Patrons get access to free previews of ebooks that I wrote in this year! Thanks for being with me all the time 🙂

I can’t tell you how much that means to me.

And now I’d love to hear from you! I’m at your service 🙂

Thank you for being with me.

Blessings,

Madalina
