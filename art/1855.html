He then takes off his hat as it becomes a cape and his mask also turns into a cape. At first, this was nothing like what the real Batman does but I'm sure he does it for a reason.

2nd Movie = The same thing, but "The Dark Knight". One of his best. Not as good as the first one.

Reboot: Batman (2005)

He's a little different now. He takes his helmet off but doesn't know his mask has became a cape at first and it takes him a while to find out but when he does he is confused and uses his bat signal as a sonar at first and a flashlight at the end of the movie when he realizes his mistake.

3rd Movie = Batman Begins (2005)

Not as good as the first one. He takes his cowl off and puts it in the Bat Signal on the outside of the cave because he is using it to see Batman's batcave. I wish I could remember his name in this one.

4th Movie = The Dark Knight (2008)

He's really different. He's really fast and strong. I love this movie. It was a mix between Batman Begins and the Tim Burton Bat-movie but the way he is shown in Begins. His suit is black, no cape and he puts on his mask when he is at his crib. He has the Batwing in this one and his Batmobile, which are just like what you see in the movies. But he takes his Bat-suit off at the end. His name is Bruce Wayne in this one.

5th Movie = Batman: Year One (2011)

The Bat-suit is back. He's got the cape and mask, he's the same. His name is Bruce Wayne. He has the Batwing again.

6th Movie = The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

Batman. Bruce Wayne. Cowl. Batcave. Cowl. Mask. Batwing. Not good. I remember him being shot by Bane in the first minute of the movie. I really really disliked this movie.

7th Movie = The Lego Batman Movie (2014)

The one I disliked the most. It didn't have Batman and is based on "The Lego Movie" that doesn't mean anything.

8th Movie = Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)

I liked this movie because they showed his suit but didn't show him much because he was being hunted by Superman at first. He is shown briefly.

9th Movie = Suicide Squad (2016)

His suit is back but his real name is not Bruce Wayne. He's just a low-life in the movie.

10th Movie = Justice League (2017)

I love this movie because it has Batman in it. The suit is black and he has the cape again. His mask is back. I don't know what his name is in this one because I never paid attention.

11th Movie = Aquaman (2018)

The suit is back. He has the cape again. His mask is back but he is an underwater man and I love that he is an underwater man.

12th Movie = Shazam (2019)

It's a little different. He doesn't have the cape or mask and his name is Billy Batson in the movie. His suit is black. No batwing in this one.

13th Movie = The Batman (2021)

The suit is back. He has the cape again. His mask is back. I love how Batman looks.

I love this Bat-man suit but I have to say The Dark Knight Returns because that was the first movie and the mask and cape is still there.

I'd like to say I don't like all of the movies, because I do, but I didn't like a lot of it. I would hate them if they didn't have Batman. My favorite is The Dark Knight because Batman is on the other side and the way they showed him and his suit really got to me. I would hate them if they don't have a batman suit and a cape and mask. I also really want him to come to live in the USA and have a big fight against a lot of villains. He'd make all of the Gotham's gangs disappear and stop the chaos of Gotham, except the Joker. He could kill him and get the Batman's Batmobile and some other Batman equipment. I just want him to continue so he can finish his movie saga in his way and not get killed by a Joker who stole the Batman's stuff and got him killed. I know there is a lot of good Batman merchandise I can't get it in here. I wish I could be rich so I can go to an expensive arcade that would be like the Batcave and watch Batman.

P.S. This guy is based on Batman. I love him. He is from the movie, The Dark Knight, which was my favorite movie until the next movie I will write.

I like the Batman character. He has all of the costumes that people don't believe he has because there are other bats that have all of those capes and masks that don't make a great movie. I think he is the best Batman because he looks like a real-life Batman. But I don't think he will ever change. I am a real Batman fan and I've always watched all of the Batmans. I have never been in any Batman toys or stuff like this. I have always tried to find the movies and watch them as many times as I can. Batman rocks.

A lot of us are so worried about it, and I don't like Batman. I think he is the biggest threat to most people on the planet because he hides in dark areas. The reason is that there are a lot of dark colors in his costume, and that makes him invisible to the people of the world. He needs to wear colors on his costume so everyone will know that there are some bad things going on in the world. A lot of children get hurt by Batman. He gets so close to people, and he can make so many bad things happen to them. They get hurt, and the criminals kill so many people.

I understand that people have to make movies for kids and the other people that don't have a clue that these bad things happen in the real world. A lot of people are too scared to stand up to Batman, because of the fact that he will kill them. Batman just puts them in jail or something like that. But I still think that he is a hero because his movie movies. He has killed so many men in the movie. I understand that Batman fights a lot of people, and it is not like he can walk away after he has killed all of them. They might not be heroes and Batman is the only one that can walk around and fight these villains to protect everyone.

I get really scared every time Batman goes on a mission. I'm not a kid, and I have nightmares every time I watch him. Batman is a real life hero. He is like every superhero you know that have secret identities. He puts on a different color when he is in his suits. But I still think that he could change more colors in his costume. I know some people will like to know more, but I think they just want to read it because they are so scared of Batman.

Batman is a great character and I'm always looking up all the Batman stuff, like the movies and video games and books, and Batman shirts. I'm scared of Batman because his black suit is so black and his mask is so thick and he doesn't talk that much, because you don't know what is going on behind him, and it's kind of a creepy feeling. I hope Batman is happy and he will see this letter. That's all.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:37
