So how much time does it take to make AFTL viable in the Fate series and if ever will we see it happen in the next game, TGS 2015.

A few years ago, we saw all the work being done on making AFTL the future of the Fate series, which included a lot of work from fans to help the project to come to life. There was even a playable demo for them to try out. For AFTL we see the original characters being used, but the newer characters are coming into their own as well. To sum it up, the whole point was to mix elements from each Fate series with Fate that was born out of the fact that we’ve been making the game for over a decade.

The game makes sure to make as many playable main characters as possible that have all been on-screen in the Fate series, which could account for a lot of the game’s production cost. To make the game more approachable, we made the game story-based, but we weren’t able to reach our audience with the game being able to fit only 3 characters. The AFTL team realized that they wanted to make sure the players were excited about the character they can play, which is a problem AFTL had because of its long duration of time it took to make, “We wanted to make sure that it was all there, with the story, characters and setting”

With this being so much of a hit for the fans to play, does it seem too good to be true? With games like FGO, will we see AFTL follow the same path? With an initial run of 3 characters, will AFTL be viable or dead in the water? As the team went on to detail, not only did they hope to release a Vita port in the future, but they also hope to get AFTL to a Western audience that will enjoy their new game.

The biggest question we had to ask was if a Fate game will be in our hands in the next few years. The answer was yes, there will be more Fate from us in the coming years, with AFTL being the first. The development team explained how AFTL is getting ready for release and how exciting it is to finally be able to put this game out. Now that the game has been released, what is next for the AFTL team?

Going forward, the game will be supporting their new game and getting ready to release a new PC release as well as a version for the PlayStation Vita. That being said, they also hope to expand the audience for AFTL as the team would also like to make another game in the series. As the team explained, the release of AFTL has been exciting and with the new direction for the Fate series, we can hope to see another sequel of AFTL someday.

What are your thoughts on the recent announcement of AFTL? Do you think that more games are needed to come to the West or do you think that AFTL was just released to get into a foreign market? Do you think that a western release would have improved the game, or would it just make it feel too distant from the rest of the Fate series? Let us know!
