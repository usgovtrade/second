In the World I See,"' he said to the air with a certain
dignity.
He has been married five times. He is
famous for throwing a lot of money
around.
The other day, an Italian film
director who is working on a film
about King Leopold was over for tea
and asked Leopold for an interview
at the Villa Leopolda.
The King said he'd be happy to.
The Italian director tried to start a
conversation about Leopold's plans
for the country.
"We plan to set up health
clinics for the people of Katanga,"
King Leopold said. "That's one of my
biggest dreams."
The director tried again.
"But, Your Majesty, we would be
interested in hearing about the plans
you have for the Congo colony."
"Well," said King Leopold, "that's
something I prefer to keep to myself.
But I do have this very pleasant
dream about health clinics for the
people of Katanga."
This was the last straw.
The Italian film director began to
rant in Italian.
He was soon joined by a French
film director who started to speak in
French and the director from India,
who started to give a long dissertation
in English.
There was much arm waving, much
gesticulating, and, eventually, much
fisticuffs.
"Why don't we just forget all about
this?" said the King.
"The problem is, the film company
has got such wonderful ideas. All
they ever want to hear about is my
plans for building new health clinics."
"The truth is," said the director from
India, "the people of Katanga do not
need any health clinics. It's true
that many of them are illiterate and
suffering from many diseases, but
these can be cured by natural means,
if only the natives would believe in
the benefits of natural medicines."
"I like the way your people have
expressed themselves," said King
Leopold. "By the way, I think it's
time for my nap."
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
decided to ask for your vote for a
second term. I hope you will grant
me the chance to continue my
program of a well-governed and -
protected Congo with the help of
all the wonderful people who are
looking after me. Thank you!
King Leopold III
"Leopold's Nose Grows On You"
Leopoldville, 10 September, 1964
"A very nice little story," said
Mamambe. "Yes, very nice."
"And the moral of the story is," said
Mombety.
Mamambe smiled. "The moral of the
story is," said Mamambe. "That's
when we said, 'How can this be?' and
in the end, 'Leopold's Nose Grows On
You.'"
"But it was a very nice story," said
Mombety.
"It was." said Mamambe.
"It is a bit odd that this man had
such a strong nose as the story says."
"It was like that when we found
him," said Mombety. "His nose was
growing like a flower, like the white
flower."
"Oh, yes, that was what we said,"
said Mamambe. "A very nice story."
"What a nose!" said Mombety.
"Yes, a very nice nose," said Mamambe.
"But no," said Mombety. "I meant, yes,
it was quite a nice story."
"The story's always been this way,"
said Mamambe. "If we find a white
man in this country, we know that
he's going to die, in the end."
"I hope you're right," said Mombety.
"I hope you're right."
"If it happens, then it happens,"
said Mamambe.
"Yes, if it happens, then it happens."
Mombety rubbed his nose. "Your
nose," he said, "is long, but it doesn't
grow on me."
"No, it does not grow on you," said
Mamambe. "It is a natural feature
that the people of this land do not
have."
They saw them that afternoon. The
two men, Mombety and Mamambe, were
hunting on the road. They were on
their way to an ape-catching pit.
Mamambe said, "This is a very good
day. Today is a very good day."
They talked about the good day.
"And this is the bad day that
follows it," said Mamambe. "There are
some bad men up there, a lot of bad
men."
"Mmm," said Mombety. "Are you sure?"
Mamambe said, "Mmm." He was sure.
"Well, what can you expect from them
that they don't know what they're
doing?"
"True," said Mamambe.
"So, we must pray for a good man in
the forest," said Mombety. "I hope
one will come."
They walked and they walked.
"Mmm," said Mamambe. "Look at all
the game! We saw so many today."
Mombety nodded.
"We saw many too," he said. "This is
a very good day."
"There will be many animals tonight,"
said Mamambe.
"Yes, there will be many."
"I'm sure there will be a bear tonight,"
said Mamambe. "I am sure. It was very
hot today."
"A bear?" said Mombety. "Do you think
it will be a white bear?"
"A white bear?" said Mamambe. "No. A
black bear. But still a good animal."
They walked and they walked.
"A good animal," said Mamambe. "Yes,
a good animal. But a very dangerous
one."
"So how can we kill him?" said
Mombety.
"We must kill him with fire."
"Yes, it must be burned up," said
Mamambe.
"A good animal," said Mombety. "A very
good animal."
They walked and they walked.
They said nothing more that afternoon.
They walked and they walked.
There were too many animals in the
forest. Too many animals for a white
man, a man who thought that he knew
the animals of the forest. A man
like Mombety and Mamambe.
A man who thought he knew many
things. A man who thought he knew
the nature of a country, a very
simple country in a very complicated
world.
The man was young and his hair was
dark. He was walking through the
forest with the two men, Mamambe and
Mombety.
He walked through the forest as a
good man, a good hunter, with his gun
in the shoulder, and his eyes looking
for game. The good hunter saw many
animals in the forest that day. He saw
the big-footed animal called a bush
pig. He saw the big-footed animal
called a sable.
A leopard and a bushcat. A spotted
ape. But there was nothing in the
forest. This was a very small part of
a very large forest. Many animals.
And there was so many. It was as if
the hunter had a headache. The man
with dark hair had a headache and it
was becoming more and more difficult
for him to see and to move. And in a
moment, he realized that he was lost.
"What?" he said. "A trap? What sort of
trap?" He was standing up, now. He
was breathing, he was struggling, but
he was no longer moving forward. He
wanted to lie down, sleep. There was a
deep, long slit in his body. His
tough hide was gone. He had become
exposed to them, to the hunters.
"Help!" he said. "I'm caught." He
started to back away. But his back
was as bare as his front. He tried to
hurry, but he was falling. He was on
his back. They had gone away, because
they were afraid of him, this man
whose name they didn't know. They
never learned his name.
He tried to move and he was moving,
but it was a slow motion. He saw the
fire start on his body and he heard
them laughing, because he had become
one of them. He became a white man in
the forest.
He thought, _They have gone on ahead_.
But no, there they were, walking
toward him. They had a gun and they
were shouting, "A white man, a white
man! Kill it!" But he knew what to do,
and he wasn't afraid, even though he
was the only white man in the world.
