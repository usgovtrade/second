Quiggly could still hear the muffled noises of the other's voices down in the darkness. As he moved stealthily in that blackness he could sense danger, but he was not afraid. He knew he was right; he could sense it all around him. He knew that his own heart and those around him were in the safest and best hands.

He knew they were in a place that was clean. In the darkness he could sense the light of a new day dawning as the dark clouds of his mind dissolved. He could hear him saying to him, "Quiggly, we will get you some breakfast."

The sweet voice sounded so calm and reassuring as Quiggly sensed a hand, a familiar strong hand in the dark place. Quiggly felt himself being led to his feet. His eyes followed in the darkness that led out into a new day, as the cloudless sky brightened with the dawn of a new day.

Quiggly was lifted up in the strong arms of this strange young man. Quiggly and the strong young man walked down a long hall of a dark place. Quiggly could not see, but he could sense it all. Quiggly sensed that there was life all around him. He could sense, and could smell and could hear, that there were people of many races, all walking through the darkness, all in the same place. As he breathed in the sweet air, he could sense with his nose, taste and feel, the aroma of food and cooking, the smell of fresh wood smoke from the fires, a smell of old smells mixed with a new fresh smell that could only be the smell of man. There was, too, he could feel it, a faint aroma, even sweet to his nose, from the flowers and trees. The fresh air blew through and the sweet aroma made him feel safe. It was like being in heaven. He was not scared, he was content. Quiggly was full.

He was led into another room, a large room, filled with people. Quiggly could hear them talking, but could not understand. His whole world was the world that he had left, that he was now in. He was in a new world that had no understanding of the strange sounds that he was hearing. He knew that they were the sounds that belonged only in the foreign lands he had left. It was as if the sounds were trying to make themselves clear to him.

"What do you want to do today, Quiggly?"

"Let me hold him," said the girl.

Quiggly looked over to see the little girl's blue eyes; he reached out to her. She put the little boy into his hands and Quiggly could see from her eyes that she was really his mom.

"A little boy," said the girl. "So brave."

It took him some time to remember how to hold the child. As he held him he could feel the boy's body go tense. He knew that he was scared.

Quiggly looked down into the baby's tiny blue eyes and knew that he needed him. He was doing the best he could to care for the boy. Quiggly knew that the baby had a home and a family. Quiggly knew that he would give up his life for the baby's sake. He knew that as long as he could do that, he could go on.

Quiggly knew that the boy would go on. He knew that he had a destiny. He knew that he was meant to go through what had happened to him. He knew that he was meant to go through it. He knew that he was meant to see the things he had seen. He knew that he had to do what he had to do. It was his destiny. His destiny was tied to the destiny of this little one. The baby was from the very same earth that Quiggly was from. He was able to sense that connection. He could sense it in the baby.

"Quiggly, let him down," the young man said as he helped Quiggly release the child.

Quiggly could still hear the sounds of voices as he walked out of the crowd. He could still hear voices as he walked out of the room into a vast woodland. It was not like a forest of trees, but more like a forest of bushes, trees and flowers. There were many people talking and working, but the sound was strange, odd, foreign. The people had a different language that he did not understand. He could hear the foreign languages that they were speaking. It was a hard and strange sound to his ears.

Quiggly could see in the distance the many workers who he could not understand. He was at a loss at the voices he could not understand. He could not understand what they were saying. He was baffled and confused. He could not understand what they were doing. He could not understand what they were eating. He could not understand what they were saying.

"What you looking at?"

"Look away."

"We eating dirt."

"This mud is for your mouth."

"Let go."

"Eat me up. Give me more."

"This is my body, given for you. I am of the soil."

"I just want to eat you all up."

"I give you my body to eat."

"You made me."

"I make all of you."

"Your seed makes me."

"You see my hand."

"Do you know why your mother likes this."

"My mother loves me."

"Your father, he made you too."

"My father makes me."

"We have made each other."

"See what I have made."

"See what I have made of you."

"See what I have made of you, made of my flesh, made of my father, made of my seed."

"I gave my father to you."

"I gave my mother to you."

"Now I have made you mine."

"We are from the same earth, made by the same seed."

"We are made by the same water."

"We are made from the same dirt."

"My mother is your mother."

"My father is your father."

"We are all from the same earth, created by the same seed."

"We all created together."

"See my hands. See the dirt on my hands. I am of the dirt. I am of the soil."

"We all made from the same dirt. See the soil, soaking in the ground. See my soil, soaking in my hands. I am made of the soil."

"You see my hands. See the dirt on my hands. I am of the dirt. I am of the soil. I am of the dirt."

"You are of the dirt. You are of the earth."

"My body."

"My hands."

"My body."

"My hands."

"The dirt."

"The soil."

"The earth."

"My body."

"My hands."

"My body."

"My hands."

"The dirt."

"The soil."

"The earth."

"My hands."

"My dirt."

"My body."

"The dirt, soil and the earth."

"See our love."

"Soil and flesh."

"The dirt, earth and the soil."

"See the love."

"The soil and flesh."

"See the love."

"Soil and flesh."

"See the love."

"S OIL AND FLESH."

"S OIL AND FLESH."

"S OIL AND FLESH."

"S OIL AND FLESH."
