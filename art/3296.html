That you just don’t think I know.

It’s been that way for long time

I keep looking back to what was me

To what did it mean

Till I could tell it doesn’t matter

‘Cause it all keeps coming back to me

I don’t wanna be alone now

But how do I know I’m alone?

‘Cause in the dark I could see you

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

You’re my best friend, but you’re insane now

All I needed was the right time now

And I never thought it would end up like this

I don’t wanna go back to when I was you now

You’re the one I would not miss, I tell you now

‘Cause in the dark I could see you

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

But I did it so well

I knew you and I could’ve been fine

Hadn’t you been so blind

I knew you and I could’ve been fine

Hadn’t you been so blind

Can I still try to tell you something?

I think you think I’m too crazy, but it’s all your fault now

I don’t wanna be like this, it isn’t fair now

Because I’m the one who gave you all of me

I’m the one who loved you, but you just kept pushing me away now

I don’t wanna go back to when I was you now

‘Cause in the dark I could see you

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

All of the things that happened

I knew I would keep it inside me

And it wasn’t a waste of time for you now

And I can try to find you all the time now

But you’re just so hard to find now

And I can try to find you all the time now

But you’re just so hard to find now

But I can try to find you all the time now

But you’re just so hard to find now

We’ve been lost the whole time now

I should’ve seen you leaving long time ago

I should’ve known that everything would be okay now

I’ll think of all the good times we had

And we both agree now

There’s so many things you do to me now

And I can’t believe it happened now

I don’t wanna see you again now

In the dark you come to me

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

But in the dark you come to me

‘Cause in the dark you come to me

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

It’s the last time I see you now

In the dark I can see you now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

‘Cause in the dark I can see you now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

Ahhh

It’s the last time I see you now

In the dark I can see you now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

Ahhh

Yeah, Ahhh

In the dark you come to me

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

In the dark I can see you now

Ahhh

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

‘Cause in the dark I can see you now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

‘Cause in the dark I can see you now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

‘Cause in the dark I can see you now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now

What am I supposed to say now?

I don’t wanna see you again now</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:56
