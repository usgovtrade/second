The UFC light heavyweight, Daniel Cormier, took to social media to apologize for comments he made on The MMA Hour this past Monday. The fighter took to twitter to explain that he has known Joe Rogan for years and has actually been a guest on The UFC’s long running show.

Here’s a few tweets he sent:

“Joe Rogan has been a guest on my podcast numerous times, and I've always had a great relationship with him,” Cormier tweeted. “Any comments that I made are my own, and were not intended to disparage Joe. The show airs Friday afternoon, and I know we are all looking forward to it. I apologize if my comments came off in the wrong way.”

I should have added that Joe is a close friend of mine that I have known for a long time. We share a lot of the same experiences, especially about training and our childhoods, and I really like him and have a great deal of respect for him. — Daniel Cormier (@dc_mma) July 18, 2019

I guess I’ll just repeat that. The comments I made on the podcast about Joe Rogan are my own and do not represent the opinions of the UFC or Zuffa. — Daniel Cormier (@dc_mma) July 18, 2019
