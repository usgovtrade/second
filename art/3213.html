Cruise-ship is the new "in" venue for getting off. For anyone who enjoys the sensual delights of being licked, sucked, spanked, and drilled in front of a large group of strangers and their partners - cruise ships are the real deal! If you crave being treated like a sloppy, filthy whore and can't get enough of playing with others in your scene, then your first port of call should be the ship's "playrooms." For those with an iron sense of self-preservation and an adventurous disposition, cruising the world's waters is not just a relaxing vacation, but an experience that can't be compared to anything else. The experience of meeting new people and playing with them, being flogged or spanked while doing it, or pleasuring strangers on both sides of a closed door ... well, it's a world full of adventures that don't happen in the normal workaday world.

And if the idea of being a slutty whore appeals to you, and you feel that you deserve the same kinds of public humiliations that other people get to experience when they want to do dirty deeds or get themselves off, then cruise-ship is for you. No matter what your age, and no matter how shy you are, if you're able to control your fear of the unknown, cruise-ship is the time and place to go. Your desires can be your fetish if you so desire, but whether it's you, or someone in your group who has fetish desires, or even if it's just a feeling that you should be given a reward for the things you like, it will be satisfied on a cruise ship.

Cruise-ship is not for everyone, and the cruise companies don't want everyone to come on board. Every hotel or "cruise port" in the world has a clientele that fits its brand. Cruise-ship is for those who are looking to explore their fetishes, be it the hot bodies and sexier attitudes that attract more straight women than straight men, to being completely tied up and helpless with as many men or women as wants to join the fun, to being made to perform sexual acts with each other, or even being given a spanking by a well-dressed man or woman.

We have been seeing such a trend to cruise ships that those seeking "dirtier" experiences are the ones in control of their desires. With new and innovative websites, cruising is no longer the adventure that is for only a small few, but a worldwide phenomenon that includes all sorts of people. While cruising, most people know what is going on for those of us who are on board, but anyone who chooses not to get off should be aware that everyone else on board knows what is going on behind closed doors and if anyone is ever to visit another ship, there are photos and stories of what happened. But if you choose to go, it will be for your own reasons that it is more of a thrill than having to live with your shame the next time you go home.

Let's look at a few scenarios that are commonly presented on cruises. It's not always easy to discuss this on cruise-port sites, so here are some examples:

There was this young woman with short blonde hair in a miniskirt who looked a lot like a college student. She was all over the men who were there, giving them backrubs and giving in and drinking with them until her friends were so jealous. They were not allowed to see the show, but as the ship left port she started begging with a man who then gave her an amazing orgasm right in front of everyone on board, who could not have resisted her.

There was this couple who was going through something of an identity crisis. She was brunette and petite and very much like a schoolteacher or librarian. He was tall, dark, and handsome and a real charmer. He told her that she needed to enjoy herself. He had her and his friend with him. She would go into a backroom with him and he would take her clothes off, have her beg for him to let her join him, while he just said that he needed to get a drink and left. She wanted him, so she didn't have to worry about his girlfriend, so she agreed. He then gave her some strong drinks until she was drunk. Then the game began. The two of them went to the bar and he flirted with all the girls there, and got himself invited to join in the "play." Then it was time to go back and get in that backroom. She was very much afraid of the man, but it didn't stop him from ordering her to get naked, spread her legs so he could eat her out. He did some serious damage to her pussy, too, before he finally finished her off with a big blow job right on the spot.

There was a very nice woman in her late twenties. She had a great body that did not look like that of a lady who was very much used to being fucked. She was dressed nicely and was not all that flamboyant, but she was brunette and very sexual. She was taken into the backroom with two younger men, and everyone had seen her having sex with them both. She never stopped begging for the two young men to fuck her, so they all three returned to the room to continue the party. The two guys were taking turns getting their cocks sucked off, and each other's asses, while she just watched them take turns as if she had never been fucked before. Then she was going to get gangbanged by everyone, but instead she ended up getting on her knees while the first young man took the brunt of her frustration. He took his own cock out and jammed it into her mouth. As the other young man watched his friends fuck her, he turned her around and fucked her from behind until she came. He then went to the bed, picked her up by her ass and used his cock to spray her pussy and face with his hot load, which she then kissed up into her mouth.

There was this couple who had traveled to cruises every year since they got married. After a short time they went back to their cabins and started playing with each other. They came out as the ship was docking, and went back to the backroom together. It was just her roommate and another young woman, who was very loud and aggressive. Soon they got the guys who just happened to be on the ship to come out of their rooms and join in. As they were playing, this other girl started getting extremely loud and aggressive, so the woman decided to order the two guys to take turns spanking her until she shut the fuck up. When he was done with his turn, the man left for the restroom, and the other two men took turns fucking this loud girl on the pool table until she too came. They left their drinks on the table, and one of the men took the two girls into the cabins, so no one would see their mess.

These stories come from the internet, and people get caught up in getting off and forgetting what they really want. The stories that appear online are not necessarily the truth, but could be based on the reality of something similar. What a cruise-ship is really about is whatever you want it to be. There is no right or wrong way to experience your fantasy.

But if you look at stories like those above, and you don't understand why these people are getting off while you're alone in your room, you're missing the point that cruise-ship is a public place with no privacy. It's not about having sex with people who wouldn't otherwise meet you, and it's not about playing with strangers on the deck or in the pool, and it's not about making strangers blow your penis in a cabaret show or having them fuck you in a dark hallway. It's not about being a slutty whore at an all-you-can-eat buffet.

And if you look at cruise-ship as an adventure you could share with the love of your life, or just a new sexual experience that does not involve going through a "trial run" to see if he's comfortable with your sex life, or a way to explore your fantasies, then it's definitely something for you. If the sex that you have in the real world is not what you crave, then there are cruise ships that will supply it. There are people with the freedom and adventure to do things that you would never do in your real life.

In the end, it's you that sets the scene. Let your fantasies take over, or be open to try something new. We all have different types of sexual fantasies. Whatever yours are, they are there for you to enjoy and you don't have to be ashamed about them. Cruise-ship is for all those who are into a lifestyle where whatever you like gets you everything you want. Your fantasy is more important than your public life, and if your partner is into cruising, it can be a fun experience that is part of your life together. If your partner is not into cruising, then go by yourself or with a partner of your own.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:45
