"It's really nice what you guys are doing, and we feel really bad that" "Catherine made out with our son." "That's why we flew to France." "Well, I feel terrible about that too." "Okay, that's..." "We need a plan, okay?" "Because if we don't figure out a way to keep the Frenchman here and make Catherine's dreams come true, then next year, when they have the Olympics in Brazil..." "And we're staying with a Brazilian family." "If I stay in Brazil that long, I'm moving there." "And you can forget about college then." "There's no way you're gonna be ready for college." "I mean, I guess you could go to some community college in Brazil." "That makes more sense." "So what do we do?" "Let's call the boys." "And before they say no, I have a suggestion." "My son always says, "Never ask your father's advice."" "Yes, I know that." "When my son was a baby, he didn't use all the words he has now." "Your son never would have said, "Never ask your father's advice."" "You know why?" "'Cause he was never in a relationship with you." "What if we said yes to the boys?" "And you go to Brazil." "And we can send you to a French university." "And once you get there, you could stay for a year on a student visa." "And you can go to that French university with me." "It's not possible." " What do you mean?" " Let's just move on." "I'm tired." "You're tired." "Let's just move on." "You do know that if you continue to deny yourself," " you'll never lose the weight?" " Move on." "You have to start letting go of your ghosts." " I can't do that." " It's too painful." "It's like ripping off a band-aid." "It just hurts too much." "Well, then maybe I'm too stupid to understand." "Because it doesn't seem like anything hurts you." "Why did you tell me that you weren't ready for a relationship" " if you don't mind me asking?" " I don't know." "I guess I didn't really want to hurt you." "Even though it did hurt me." "That's no excuse, okay?" "I am a big piece of trash." "I lied about the letters from my mom, the letters from my dad, my whole friggin' life!" "My parents are friggin' divorced, and I have one brother." "You're my only friend." "You know that, right?" "You're a decent person." "You can't continue to act like the world owes you something." "Okay, the world doesn't owe us anything." "Why can't you just say that?" "What's wrong with you?" "Is it hard for you to admit that you are part of the problem?" "Yeah, it is." "You made me cry today!" "And it was very hard for me to have that conversation with you." "I can't stop the way I feel, okay?" "That's why I don't go for love." "But I'll tell you what." "I do want to be a part of a real family, and I think if I were a part of your family," "I could help you." "Maybe I don't want that either." "You're such a little brat." " What did you call me?" " A little brat!" "God, and you always have to say the right thing!" "You know what, I'm done trying to save you!" "I think you need to come out of your shell!" " You didn't have to fly off the..." " Don't touch me." "Because you feel bad?" "What if I'm right?" "What if I'm right about life?" "This is not the way that I wanna go." "I can't find the words to describe it, but I..." "I just..." "You know what?" "I can't fight this anymore, okay?" "And..." "And don't go because of me." "I'm not going because of you." "If you wanna go, you can't." "And that's fine, but I just..." "I can't go." "And if I let you..." "I'm never gonna forgive myself." "It's not your fault." "It's mine." "Thank you for letting me know who I am." "This is really gonna help me with my mom and her new wife." "I gotta say, I love the way they're talking about the guy." "He's so brave to show himself." "That's pretty much him." "You want me to throw him out?" "No." "He's done." "And I'm moving on." "What about me?" "I don't wanna stop making love with you." "It just seems that every time I'm with you, you..." "Take your time with me." "I can't believe this is all so hard." "It just takes some effort." "Come on." "Hey, you can't get rid of me that easily." "I love you." "I'll always love you." "But that's gonna get real old and really depressing, so..." "I'm so cold." "Come on, let's get out of here." "Do you want to try someplace warm?" "I'm so sorry." "I'm so sorry." "I have no idea what you're saying." "I got nothing." "Are you saying you want a divorce?" "Yeah." "That'd be best." "All right." "I'll just go to the lawyer's office tomorrow." "We can sign everything." "So I guess that's it, right?" "So it's over." "I was hoping we could talk about us before that." "That's a terrible idea." "Please." "I'm sorry, I'm not good at this." "You have to know this is the worst possible timing for me to get into this with you." "Look, I feel terrible about everything that's happened between us." "And I just need some time to sort through all of this." "Just to figure out what I want." "Let me just start by saying thank you for being honest." "It means a lot to me." "What I wanna say is," "I'm just going through some changes right now, and I think you're making a lot of those changes." "I know you're trying, and I wish I could be the same way." "I know I can't." "I can be the same way you are, because I can be selfish." "I can be shortsighted." "And I can be immature sometimes." "And I'm gonna try to change all of that." "I'm sorry." "I hope that we can still be friends." "What's the matter?" "What are you doing?" "This is what you do when you get your heart broken, right?" "It's what you do?" "You take off into the woods with a shotgun?" "You know you're not supposed to do that." "This is the worst thing you could possibly do right now." "You're in a really bad place." "I want you to know that I was just gonna get some space." "Then we'd get back together and get back to where we were." "I wanted to tell you that in the woods, if you had to have somebody, I could be that somebody." "I think we both need some time to figure out what we want." "That's all I'm trying to say." "I love you." "And I know you love me, but..." "I think we both need some time, okay?" " I'm sorry." " We can talk about this when you get back." "I hope you realize that this is gonna be bad for you!" "You're the one who doesn't care about anyone else!" "I will go back and tell them you're here!" "Don't touch her!" "Mom?" "Mom!" "Oh, my God!" "Catherine!" "I was scared to death!" "No, no, no, no." "Don't cry." "Come here, come here." "It's okay." "It's okay." "Come here." "I was so worried about you." "Why did you run away from me?" "Catherine." "You didn't find him, did you?" "No, Mom." "He's not here." "Catherine, why did you run away from me?" "What is it?" "Okay, let's go." "Just tell me right here." "Don't make Mommy feel any more crazy than she already does, okay?" "Okay." "But I'm not kidding around." "I need to know what's going on." "Okay." "And I don't care that you run away from me, okay?" "As long as you come home in time for dinner every night, all right?" "Honey?" "Who do I look like?" "It's all right." "We're not mad at you anymore." "You are so bad." "Here we go." "Look at this."
