which the government is giving
money to electricity consumers,
has been marked with 
quite a controversy
of late.
What's the beef with it?
Are you, too, in the controversy
because you've paid the carbon tax?
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.
>> Dr. ELLEN JAMES:
Yeah.
This is going on.
I can't help you much, but
anyway, this is the point.
The government's given a carbon tax
and let people who 
generate carbon pay it
in the scheme.
And people who, the consumers,
are paying the price that's actually
tied to emissions as well.
How much are you paying?
The most extreme case I 
found was in Nova Scotia.
And so Nova Scotia, this province, 
was paying $583,000 per year per person.
Why? Because Nova Scotia produces
lots of carbon.
And so, in that case,
they were buying the carbon credits
that actually caused the carbon 
emissions, and so they have to do it.
So there's another aspect
of carbon.
It is actually a price, 
and we'll see what the 
market does with that.
And we'll also see what 
consumer demand is going to do
with the price being placed on carbon.
So today we're going to talk about
the effects that this is having 
and how it may manifest itself
in the future.
>> If I can ask, what about when
you think of this, carbon trading,
like you said, that 
can go on with this,
there's a lot of people now 
are calling that double-dipping.
So they're talking about having to 
charge the carbon tax and also pay
for a rebate to be given back.
If I have a car, or if I'm 
in a family, I pay the carbon tax,
so it's kind of double-dipping.
How is that not double-dipping?
>> Dr. ELLEN JAMES: 
And there's a double dip
of all sorts.
You know, this gets 
a little complicated,
but I just want to say one thing.
The thing that's weird about this is
is that the price is carbon.
If you don't want to do it
you don't have to do it,
but if you don't want to do it,
then you don't have to do it.
So there's a bit of funky stuff 
there that I can't go into too much,
but there are different 
sort of double-dipping things
that we could do 
with all sorts of taxes.
And so double-dipping is a feature
of having a carbon price,
so, we know that, 
but it doesn't have to be
a double-dip of carbon taxes.
They're sort of two different things.
So, if you're charging 
something in one way or another,
then the government 
would give you a rebate.
In Newfoundland and 
Labrador, where I grew up,
everybody gets a rebate, 
and it's not an offset,
it's actually a rebate.
So it doesn't have to be paid back,
but we do want to make sure that 
people do something about the carbon,
and so that's another thing we're
focusing on, to help them,
and so there's ways of doing that.
And so, there's multiple 
ways of designing things.
There's also multiple ways of doing 
the same thing, so you could say,
I want to sell carbon credits, 
if you do that you need
to buy the right stuff in Canada
so that you can have the right credits,
so there's a complicated 
set of things you have to do.
But the point is that carbon 
has to be priced somehow.
And if you do this, you can make sure
that you're actually 
reducing emissions.
And there are all sorts of 
ways you could do that, and that's,
I don't know if it 
has to be a direct price,
or if it can be through tax, or...
So in Ontario, they've 
done this sort of thing.
We've seen it before in 
the United Kingdom.
And in Ontario, they made it 
like a charge for transportation,
and so it's a bit complicated, 
but there are different ways.
The issue is the amount of carbon 
emissions in the United States.
The United States produces 
more than the rest of the world,
and you know how much you produce 
is how you're going to be
regulated as a country, so.
So the United States has a tremendous
amount of pollution, 
for reasons I won't go into,
and so it would be 
cheaper for them to use,
and so the cost per person there 
is very low, actually.
So they don't need to do anything, 
which is sort of the point.
This gets a little bit more 
complicated, I can see that,
so the government in California
has said that you 
can use this carbon trading.
So if you're going to use 
the California exchange,
then you get a green card and then 
you can make a profit by buying carbon
credits in one place and 
selling them in another place,
and you get a rebate for doing that.
And that's all great,
but some companies have already said,
we're just going to leave 
California, if you do that,
and then the whole 
argument, the whole thing
gets a bit more complicated.
I'll try to tie it up in 
a nice little bow, there.
So, that's how the system 
works, at the simplest level.
So let's look at the numbers
because I want to show that.
You're the one who's 
going to get them now.
I would have to go and 
talk to you about it,
and a few people down 
there will explain them.
This is a list of the countries 
that are members of Kyoto.
But then you have to take, 
this goes from the year 1990,
so it goes back to the '80s, 
it doesn't go to the present day.
So this is an example 
of carbon emissions in 1990.
I'm just showing it as a sort of 
way of saying that the United States 
has a high number of carbon emissions
in relation to the rest of the world,
and it's because it's 
all going to be regulated,
because the United States 
has a huge emissions numbers.
And if you look at Canada, 
which you saw just now,
this is the chart from Canada.
Canada emits almost as much 
carbon dioxide, about the same,
but because it's in the 
midst of some very serious glaciers,
because of a huge 
amount of ice in northern Canada,
there's not so much...
There are just big 
boulders of ice in there,
and so that produces less 
carbon dioxide than we do.
But the United States 
has a huge number.
Now, how did we get there?
That was in 1990, and then 
it's projected to continue growing.
And I'll talk about it in a 
minute, the world and so on.
But why did it grow so much?
The world grew, and the 
U.S. is not the world.
The world grew as well, 
and when you're developing countries,
the amount of carbon you 
produce goes up by 50% or 60%
as your GDP goes up.
And so the United States 
goes through a massive shift
in terms of their consumption of
material goods, and so they need 
more energy to produce things.
And they're not doing any of the 
things that will help them reduce 
their carbon emissions, like, so.
But one of the reasons 
that's happened is
that it's much easier to 
buy goods from Asia than it is
from North America.
So in this case, 
it's all consumption 
that is related to transport,
and so what it's sort of doing is
the United States has developed,
so they've got these big 
numbers, but they've got lots
of other people to help 
out as well, so that helps
out the economies of 
developing countries,
but it helps out as well, 
as we develop the United States,
the development of the 
United States helps
out the development of 
the rest of the world,
so they're going to have 
a growing carbon emissions,
and then they have 
a very complicated part.
