<p>I’m a huge fan of <i>Weird Al</i>. I think his voice and his humor are fun. It’s always interesting to hear what he has to say. And he’s clearly got talent. But I just didn’t think that <i>Don’t Download These Songs</i> was a great album. I could tell that the songs were the results of Al taking songs that weren’t necessarily his and making them his, which is not always a bad thing. There are some really funny songs on it, but it was just an overall mediocre effort for me.</p>
<p>As an indie music lover, I’m thrilled that the digital format exists, but for now, it’s just not really a viable format for the vast majority of people. Most people aren’t into buying a song unless it is a big hit from a known artist. The people who do buy music generally want to buy CDs or download an entire album, but many have little chance of finding an entire album. Plus, on a digital format, the music can be shared more easily. So I think CDs are still the best way to promote your music.</p>
<p><b>Dwight</b> I didn’t think <i>Don’t Download These Songs</i> was a bad album, but that is only because the songs are so <i>obviously</i> the result of his creative efforts. The album has a certain amateurish charm to it. The music is amateurish, and the vocals even more so. When he is actually performing, he does sound pretty good. But I’d rather hear an actual rock album rather than one of these <i>Weird Al</i> parodies.</p>
<p>Yeah. That’s the problem with this album. Al is great at parody. But can he go one step further? Can he actually write a song of his own?</p>
<p>I do know a few people that have put together some parody albums of their own. With any luck, we’ll start to see people like <i>Dwight</i> put together a few serious rock albums of their own.</p>http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/weekly_recap_weekend_music_news_new_releases_tunesmiths_dave_cassaro#commentsColumnsDave CastroDave CasoniTunesmithsWeekly Recapweekly recapWendy MacGregorWebcastsWed, 30 Nov 2011 17:56:48 +0000Wendy MacGregor13548 at http://www.maclife.comWeekend Recap: Weekend Music News, New Releases, Podcasts & Videohttp://www.maclife.com/article/columns/weekend_recap_weekend_music_news_new_releases_podcasts_video

I don’t even own a proper MP3 player. I have a simple <a href="http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/imac_and_ipod_the_ipod_saga">iPod</a>, and that works just fine for me. But I think it’s silly when people argue over who can build the best MP3 player. In this <a href="http://maclife.com/article/columns/weekly_recap_weekend_music_news_new_releases_podcasts_video?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+maclife/Columns+(MacLife.com+Columns)">Weekly Recap</a>, I said that iTunes isn’t going anywhere, and I stand by that. I still think that the iPod is the best, but that doesn’t mean there’s not room in the market for new MP3 players. I mean, there’s a lot of great and innovative MP3 players out there, but I just don’t think there’s any perfect match for the iPod. There are a lot of factors to consider: your needs, your budget, your taste, and more. I’d like to know what you think about these different music players, because I want your help in making my decision. My problem is I don’t know enough about them. So if you want to show me your favorite player, or if you think you’re the ultimate MP3 buyer, tell us about it on <a href="http://maclife.com/forums/showthread.php?t=453346">our Forums</a>. And don’t be shy -- tell us what music player you use the most. I can tell you that <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/episode+12/id38741771?mt=2">last weekend I purchased eight digital music albums</a> for a total of nine songs.<br /><br /><b>Itunes Top Downloads - Week #18</b><br /><br />As you can see, it’s a really exciting time to be a music lover.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:16
