He felt as if he were made of
nothing but ice and cold, as if he had come out of the snow, and had
certainly not come down into it. His hands and feet were numb, his lips
were like ice, his body ached as if from an attack of rheumatism, his
eyes were benumbed, he could not see, and yet he could not put his
hands over them. It seemed to him that he would never be warm again.
How long he had been in the snow! It seemed ages. He lay there, unable
to move, and yet he felt he was dying. Death did not frighten him--he
could not feel himself dying. Had he been dead before? Was he dead now?
What was he doing? Something seemed to flutter over him. He moved his
hand. It fell on soft snow, snow that yielded to his touch. The snow
was warm. Something was warm--it must be the snow! What was the snow
doing here--in such a place? It had never been in the road. He must be
lying--he had been lying--somewhere else. Was that the snow under his
head? It was--it was snow. What was it doing here? Why was it here?

He knew it must be snow. It must be snow that he had been lying on,
that had been cold and hard and cruel, hard and cold and cruel, hard and
cold and cruel, and then had become soft and warm and nice, soft and
warm and nice, soft and warm and nice--so nice that it seemed as if it
had taken a share of the warmth and kindness that was in him, a share of
the goodness in him, a share of the love in him.

And that made him think of a thing that had happened to him when he was
about eight years old. He had been put to bed--his mother was going
away, and she and his father and brother were saying good-bye. He had
been put to bed with his face to the wall, and had hidden his head under
the pillow, because it hurt him when he had to say good-bye. There he
lay, hiding his head under the pillow, when his mother came back. He
heard her kiss him, and speak to him, and soothe him. And he was angry
at first, until he heard her kiss his father and brother good-bye, and
heard them call him. Then he felt lonesome and sorry, and began to cry.
He heard her go downstairs again, and then he began to cry very hard.
And he heard her come up again, and stand by his bed, and then he knew
he was forgiven.

He was ashamed now, after what had happened to him on the bridge. But
there had been love in her voice, and there was love in the snow, soft
and warm and nice. And there was love in her kiss on his forehead. He
would not be ashamed again, but should always know that he was forgiven.
And he was not alone. Love was everywhere, and made everything warm and
kind.

And then, out of the goodness and tenderness in him, came an impulse to
go on with the man who had been so kind to him. He felt as if he must
help and comfort him, and yet he did not know what to do. He lay there,
wondering if he ought to move. It might be nice, and kind, and yet--yet
it was against reason--the man might be asleep--he should not go to
sleep again himself, perhaps he should keep awake, so as to help him, so
as not to leave him alone--he ought to get up and put on his clothes,
put on his boots and his cap and his coat, and go away. He began to
struggle with his hands. The more he struggled, the harder it was.
"Don't be rough with the snow," he said; "it is so soft and nice."
Then he thought he could not move. He was so cold that he could not move
his hands, and he did not dare to move them any more, for fear of
hurting himself. But the man might be dying, and he had the sense to
put his hand on his heart, and find that he was still alive.

What had he done? Had the man died? No, he could not have died. The man
had only slipped and hurt his leg. Had he killed him? What would the
man's wife and children think of him when they saw him again, if he did
not get up? For one of his feet must have touched the man's head. He was
cold, so cold that he felt as if the ground he was lying on was frozen,
as if the snow would never be thawed again. And then, after he had been
cold for ever so long, had been cold since he had gone to sleep, after
he had lain there for hours and hours, until his heart began to feel
funny and strange, and he had got a pain that hurt him from head to
foot--and then, all of a sudden, a thing happened.

When he first went to sleep, after that horrible half-hour, he was lying
in the sun, and the sun was shining in his eyes. He remembered that
heavily, and for some reason he did not like it. It frightened him, and
then he must have slept again. But all of a sudden there were clouds in
the sky--the clouds were coming up from the south--it looked as if it
must rain--it must rain--and there was rain in his eyes, so that he did
not see any more. The next thing he knew, he was on the top of a bridge.
The man was calling, "Come along, come along, I will not keep you a
minute," and he answered "yes" and put his hand into his coat-pocket to
take his purse. He could feel it when he went down the hill, and he
would just give it to him, and then go. He was so cold that he could
not stand up, and he thought he would sit down a minute to rest. He
could hardly get up when the man pulled him up, and as he sat down,
there fell on him a warm thing, so warm that he was ready to cry with
pleasure. It was a soft, warm, strange thing that he could not make out
at first, something that he felt a little way in, like a baby, that did
not hurt, but only made him warm and happy.

And then he could not sit still any more, and he was afraid to, and he
thought he would walk about a little, so that the warm thing would
breathe on his back. He walked round the wall for a little, he did not
know what he did, he did not feel anything that he did. And then he
came back to the man, and he was very tired, and he thought he would
lie down for a minute.

When he touched him, he was cold and hard, and when he called to him he
did not answer. And then he began to feel angry with him, and he put
out his hand to shake him, and when he felt him he was cold and hard,
and when he called to him he felt as if his head were cut in two. And
when he did not answer, he was so angry that he knew what he would do,
he would shake him and shake him, until he woke up, and then he would
give him a little kiss and say "Good-bye." And then he began to cry
because he was so cold.

Then there came a sense of relief, as if something were being lifted
off, as if he were waking up. He must be awake. There was a terrible
thing in his arms--a horrid cold, hard thing that hurt him. He tried to
put it from him, he tried to wake, to move--he tried to get away from
it. But it seemed as if he were frozen. And then it began to hurt him,
and then to burn him, as if he were on fire. Something was stinging him,
squeezing him, like little red hands that burned and burned and burned.
And then it began to go away, to leave him, and to go far away, far
away. And he seemed to sink into a great, soft mass that was so much
bigger than he was. Then all was darkness and cold, and the soft,
strange thing was far away, far away, far away. And then the cold went
away, and he was asleep.




_Chapter XVI_


When he awoke he was lying in his bed, and it was the man and his wife
and his boy who had been playing on the bridge that had hurt him so
much, but they were gone. There was no one there. His brother's picture
was on the dressing-table, the silver handle of the key was on the
mantel-shelf, but there was no one. And then it came over him, that the
man must be dead. He tried to cry. He felt as if his throat were dry,
