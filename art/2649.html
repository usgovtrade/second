"We know the trees can be an advantage, but we don't want to give them an advantage. Maybe we go with our backs to the trees. We have to be aggressive."

Donaldson, who hit .226 with 10 homers and 53 RBIs in 106 games this season, said that this team must learn to persevere without its veteran stars in its lineup.

"We need to be able to play our game the same way whether it's Manny or Trout in the lineup," he said. "We are a young team, but we have to prove we can play winning baseball, that we can play at this level."

Cano also said this young team will be tested on the road in the playoffs this season, especially after struggling in the early rounds of last year's postseason.

"We have to continue learning how to win on the road," Cano said. "It's definitely a different experience. It's different from home and it's different from the dome.

"It's a lot of fun. We are excited to go there and play, and we need to enjoy it. It's another opportunity for us to prove to ourselves and to the baseball world we can do something special."
