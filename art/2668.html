No, he has to hide from the soldiers who are looking for him! Oh, don’t
shoot him!

Lucky:
The people who did this to your father–do you want them to keep living? Do
you want your father to keep living?

Sue:
Lucky is asking for me, Dad. I’m hiding.

Duck:
There’s got to be a place to hide in this city, right? All I need is to be
able to go outside. I need to go outside and get away. They won’t let me out. They’re after me. They’re after me. There’s got to be a place to
hide in this city, right? I have to go, like I always do. I’ve got to go,
like I always do.

Sue:
Lucky, I don’t understand this. We’re friends!

Sue:
Lucky, I don’t understand this. We’re friends!

Jack:
What’s going on over there? I think the other ship’s been shot down.

Sue:
But how can you go away and leave us when you know what’s happening here? You’ve got to help. Come with us, help us.
We’re all looking for you.

Jack:
No, Jack, we can’t live like this anymore. The war in Europe is going to
end. I know it’s going to end because you and Mother wrote and told me.
I know it’s going to end because you and Mother wrote and told me. I know
it’s going to end. I saw it in your letter. You have to come home! You’ve
got to go back with us and never leave us again! I saw it in your letter. You have to come home! You’ve got to go back with us and never leave us again!

I saw it in your letter. You have to come home! You’ve got to go back with us and never leave us again!

Sue:
I know that he doesn’t want you to suffer anymore. If it was up to him,
he would stay here with me. You know that he doesn’t want you to suffer
anymore. He’s got to go, you know that. Why can’t you understand what
he’s doing? Why can’t you understand what he’s doing? He’s got to go,
you know that. Don’t you think that if he were here, the war wouldn’t
be happening? There wouldn’t be any war! The war wouldn’t be happening.
The war would never have happened if he were here. So it’s only right
that you go. Just like you said, it’s the only way that you could stop
hurting, right? Just go, it’s the only way.

Lucky:
I can understand why he wouldn’t want to be in a place like this. You must
have lots of fear right now, trying to survive. I can understand why you
wouldn’t want to be in a place like this. You must have lots of fear
right now, trying to survive. But even if it is war, we’re still looking
for you! I know you are still here! And you always will be. You’re
always still here. And there’s always a chance. If there’s a possibility, I have to look for you. I have to look for you.

Sue:
Jack, please, you can’t leave! Just for a little while. You just told me
how you want to see some lights, so we’ll wait here together. And when
the lights come, when the lights come–and you will see them come–they’ll
be you and me, together, with our hands joined. And then we can
escape together.

Lucky:
Come on! We have to run! We can escape, even if you can’t. We can escape
even if you can’t. I’m going to wait for you on that hill! So long, Lucky!
Don’t you ever forget us! So long, Lucky! Don’t you ever forget us!

Jack:
I can’t believe that I never noticed how amazing the night sky is in a
city like this. There’s no place like this in the world.

Sue:
Lucky, don’t you ever forget us! We can escape, even if you can’t. We
can escape even if you can’t. I’m going to wait for you on that hill!
So long, Lucky! Don’t you ever forget us! So long, Lucky! Don’t you ever forget us!

Jack:
Lucky, if you came back to this spot, would you know this place? It would
be the same place that you remember, just a different time, and it would
be as though you never left. But time is always such a difficult thing
for us to understand. Because we need it to be the same, and we want it
to be the same. We need the day to be just like it used to be, but the
day doesn’t want to be the same, so we try to hold on to it and keep it
from changing. But then, it’s hard. It can be so hard. We know it.

I know it. We know it. We know it. But we try to hold on to it and keep it from changing.

Sue:
We have a feeling that we’re going to start remembering the same thing.

Sue:
But Lucky, if you came back here, would you know this place? It would
be the same place that you remember, just a different time, and it would
be as though you never left. But time is always such a difficult thing
for us to understand. Because we need it to be the same, and we want it
to be the same. We need the day to be just like it used to be, but the
day doesn’t want to be the same, so we try to hold on to it and keep it
from changing. But then, it’s hard. It can be so hard. We know it.

We know it. We know it. But we try to hold on to it and keep it from changing.

Jack:
Lucky, I hope you can’t leave me. I’m so afraid that something bad is
going to happen. I’m so afraid that something bad is going to happen. I’m so afraid that I’ll lose you. Because I’m not
good at waiting. I’m so afraid that something bad is going to happen. I’m so afraid that something bad is going to happen. I’m so afraid that I’ll lose you. Because I’m not
good at waiting.

Sue:
Jack, I love you. So much that it hurts. So much that it hurts. It hurts, Jack, it hurts.

Sue:
Jack, I love you. So much that it hurts. It hurts, Jack, it hurts.

Sue:
No! Jack, stop! Stop! I love you, Lucky. So much. So much. So much that it hurts. So much that it hurts.

Sue:
Lucky, stop! Stop! I love you, Lucky. So much. So much that it hurts.
So much that it hurts.

Sue:
We can escape, even if you can’t! We can escape, even if you can’t!
I’m going to wait for you on that hill! So long, Lucky! Don’t you ever forget us! So long, Lucky! Don’t you ever forget us!

Jack:
This is the same thing that you remember. You can’t ever change your
mind, Lucky. It’s impossible for you.

Jack:
This is the same thing that you remember. You can’t ever change your
mind, Lucky. It’s impossible for you.

Sue:
Jack, we can escape, even if you can’t! We can escape, even if you can’t!
I’m going to wait for you on that hill! So long, Lucky! Don’t you ever forget us! So long, Lucky! Don’t you ever forget us!

Sue:
He’s still here! Even if the place has changed, he’s still here. You know
that he’s still here, Lucky. Don’t you? Don’t you?

Sue:
Jack, I love you. So much that it hurts. So much that it hurts. It hurts, Jack, it hurts.

Jack:
Sue, your face seems different. I’m going to stop talking about him, okay?

Jack:
Sue, your face seems different. I’m going to stop talking about him, okay?

Jack:
Don’t you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:52
