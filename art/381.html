The records of Maine show that many of the old Puritan families (and names) of Maine trace back to Pilgrims.

Henry Champlain, in 1622, became the first governor of Nova Scotia, and in 1663, Samuel Winthrop (afterwards Sir) was appointed to succeed him in his post, and resided for many years there. The first settlers in Maine, also, were largely Puritans.

It was in 1660 that the English Commonwealth, under Oliver Cromwell, was overthrown, and the Stuarts, descendants of the Plantagenet line of kings, were restored.

James Stuart, the Third of that line, was beheaded for treason in 1685, and the crown then devolved on his daughter Mary, who became the wife of William of Orange, and became, at his death in 1688, the wife of James, her grandson, who became James II. Mary died in 1694, and her brother, Charles II., succeeded to the throne.

James II. was deposed in 1688, and a republic was declared in England.

James II., during his exile, resided with the Dutch Republic, and his son William, afterwards William III. and Elector of Great Britain, was born there in 1650.

William’s marriage to Mary, heiress of the house of Orange, with her vast possessions and the English crown, was the cause of his invitation to take up the vacant crown of England in 1688.

In 1701, Queen Anne came to the throne, and with her, George of Hanover.

King George I. died in 1727, and his son George II., the last of the German dynasty.

George II. was succeeded in 1760, by his son George III.

George III. died in 1820, and was succeeded by his eldest son, George IV., who had become by his marriage to Queen Victoria in 1818, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and Emperor of India.

King George IV. died in 1820, and was succeeded by his eldest son, William, Duke of Clarence, who was the father of the reigning monarch of England, King George V., and grandfather of George VI.

The kings of England, before the Conquest, were known by many titles.

King Harold II. was a Saxon of the line of the Warenne. The last of the Saxon kings was Ethelred II., who was overthrown and killed at the battle of Ashdown.

The first Norman kings were William of Normandy, and his son William the Conqueror, or William II., who had been born at Falaise in Normandy. He was the son of Robert, Count of Flanders, one of the Norman line.

Norman dukes ruled England. Robert, William the Conqueror’s brother, was called the Earl of Mortagne; and his son Robert, Duke of Normandy, became the first Duke of the country, but died without children.

The title of England fell to the third son of William, called William of Warenne, who had married Matilda, daughter of Henry I., King of England, and niece of William the Conqueror. The dukedom was conferred on the son of the Duke of Normandy.

His son, Henry II., in the reign of Henry I., held the title of Lord of the Manor, being lord of Richmond, and Earldom of Warenne, and when he married Margaret, daughter of Malcolm, King of Scotland, he became Lord of Richmond.

The title, of Earl of Richmond, which was given to Margaret, was taken from Richmond Castle, in Yorkshire, which was held by his family, and which descended to them from Edgar, son of Malcolm, King of Scotland.

At a later period, it was held by the Earls of Richmond and Tudor.

John de Warenne was the son of Henry II. and Margaret of Scotland. He fought in France, and in Normandy, Scotland, and England, and died in 1264.

In the reign of Henry III. was fought the battle of Lewes, near Southampton, and it was on this occasion that Richard, Earl of Cornwall, fought in the field, for the Earldom of Cornwall, and the crown of England.

The Earl of Cornwall was the youngest son of John, Earl of Cornwall, and Joan, the daughter of Henry II., the daughter of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and the only one of his children who could legally claim the crown of England. The contest was first between John and his brothers Henry, Earl of Cornwall, and Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, and then between John and Richard, Duke of York. In the end, John Henry de Cornoua was beheaded by Richard at Kenilworth Castle.

In the reign of Edward III. was fought the battle of Crecy, near Calais, and this led to the final battle of the White Horse, between the troops of Edward III., under his son Edward, Prince of Wales, and the English barons and soldiers, the Yorkists. This battle was the most destructive in the history of England.

The Yorkists were victorious, and their leader, Edward, Prince of Wales, afterwards Edward IV., succeeded to the throne of England, in 1399, and the Earls of Cornwall were the principal nobles of the kingdom; their palaces in Cornwall, that of Lanherne and Pendennis, and others, still in existence.

In 1399, when the king was Edward IV., he was in France, and when the Prince of Wales was captured at the battle of Agincourt, (this was a very important battle,) it was the Earl of Pembroke who had the charge of him.

At that time, the Earl of Cornwall was John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. He was made Duke of Lancaster, Earl of Leicester, Earl of Richmond, and Earl of Pembroke. He married Blanche, daughter of King John of France, sister of Henry V., and she afterwards married him a second time to Blanche of Lancaster, of whom was born Prince Edward, the grandson of Blanche of Lancaster, and after his marriage, King Edward IV.

Prince Edward was made Duke of Cornwall and Earl of Chester and Duke of Aquitaine, on his marriage with the daughter of the French king, and when he died, in 1470, he was succeeded as King Edward V. by his son, Edward of Lancaster. This son was succeeded by his brother Henry, whose son succeeded as Henry VII.

At his accession, in 1485, he was succeeded by his nephew, Arthur, son of the Lady Margaret Beaufort, and grandson of King Edward IV., and it is said that this queen was a descendant of the blood royal. He was succeeded by his son, Henry VIII. and then, Edward VI. succeeded in 1547. Henry VIII. had married his mother’s sister, Catherine of Arragon, and then married his sister’s daughter, Anne Boleyn, who was his second wife.

Anne, who had borne him an only daughter, Mary, died in 1536, and two years after, he married Jane Seymour, who was dead in 16 days; and after being divorced from her, he married Anne of Cleves, who died in giving birth to a baby daughter.

James, the eldest son of Edward VI., died at the age of thirteen, and when Mary was fifteen years old, married Philip of Spain, and they had two children.

Her successor was Queen Elizabeth, and she was succeeded by her sister, Mary, who is now, Queen Mary II., and after her, Queen Elizabeth.

Mary II. is at present Queen of England.

Elizabeth was succeeded by James I., who had issue by Anne of Denmark.

James II. had no issue, but he had two wives, Henrietta, his second wife, and Mary, her sister, who became queen of Scotland.

Mary, daughter of James I., was the wife of William of Orange, by whom James Francis Edward Stuart was born in 1688.

James Francis Edward Stuart was the first British Prince of Wales, and he was succeeded by his nephew, Frederick Augustus, commonly called the Duke of York, and this duke was succeeded by George of Hanover, who died in 1827, and was succeeded by George IV., who was born in 1762, and he was succeeded by his eldest son, who succeeded him as George V., and was succeeded by Edward VII., who died in 1910.

Edward VII. had one child, Prince George, the Duke of York, who was succeeded by his son, who was born in 1892, and he is the present sovereign. He was Prince of Wales when he succeeded to the throne.

One of the names of the old English royal family, when Richard I. of Normandy was king of England, was Richard, son of King Henry I.

Two of the names of Edward I. are of interest in English history. He was the eldest son of Henry, son of Edward the Confessor, and he inherited the Duchy of Aquitaine, of the crown, and of Gas</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:29
