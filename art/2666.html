Bangkok, Thailand, December 4, 2006. The first two flights of the Hanoi based TU-143s are out for an unexpected visit. It is Christmas time, and this would be our last flight before the end of the year. The weather over South East Asia is beautiful, clear and blue skies. It is a great opportunity to get in some air-to-air photography.

The TU-143 in the foreground is the most recent batch of the aircraft that were received in 2006, and the one on the left is the first batch of TU-143s delivered in 2006.

These are two of the last of the TU-143s still in service. This aircraft is not seen much due to the fact that it operates from Bangkok for many years. We are not expecting the TU-143s to be seen often since their last flight was in 2003. The last flight to be captured for the Thai Air Force was a couple of years ago. You can still see the markings of the Royal Thai Air Force on this TU-143. These TU-143s flew this way when they last saw active service.

TU-143 in the background (left) has the markings of a former RAAF aircraft that was recently retired. RAAF have retired two of these TU-143s in recent years.

TU-143 on the left that we captured in 2008, this one is operated by the Royal Thai Air Force. Notice the rear loading ramp where this TU-143 received it last batch of aircraft parts from a Soviet Antonov AN-26, which is the plane at the bottom.

TU-143 in the background here is also the last TU-143s to be retired. This one was retired from the Royal Thai Air Force and is operated by the Royal Thai Navy.
