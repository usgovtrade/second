But again you're welcome to the game and I hope you will contribute and make it one of the better Battle Royale games around.

You're very right

The game is already like a battle royale mod, you can easily do it yourself by going to the spawn room and setting the spawn point to 1 and then leaving the game by pressing escape and go back to the game after it loaded. If you're in the same lobby you should be able to spawn to the first person you want.

If that's not clear you can also look at the first video of the post where I'm the blue guy with a red cross.

You're telling everyone how to do it when you know no one needs this info?

What if I just want to play the custom game where I can select maps and options? Why should I have to go and set a "spawnpoint"? I can't make a custom game that has those settings and I don't want to play those custom games, I want a regular server with a regular set up of custom game options and maps and other features. My server is going to be mostly casual players and the less amount of settings and options the better. All I want is a map set by me to select from a list of maps and I want some players to have options. This is why I want to use the game creator. Not because I don't want to set spawnpoints.

I made this thread so we can use a map with custom settings because I know people don't want to play random battle royale game. Why should I have to install that mod and play in the random server?

This is exactly what I've been saying. You CAN make custom game with settings and features and we should use a map maker to choose a map and make a mod that only people who play the mod can see when they join, not just randomly join a random server with no settings and features and a randomly chosen map. This can be something good and I'll also see why this happens in my next reply.

This is why I have to use the random server, if I want to join an already existing server and make a custom game with settings, I have to go to a random server where I don't know what kind of settings there is. What am I supposed to do? Go to a random server with no settings and play, then start setting up settings and features. This is why I say that if you make a game you don't have to add those things that aren't that necessary. It's an unneeded complication and more for people who want to play. It's just like, what's the point of asking players to have a list of maps in a game that can also be played without them? If you want to play with these settings that aren't exactly for those types of players who don't want to play random games (that would be me, I'll just ignore the map maker and play from a list of maps anyways, maybe I'll add some features too when I find out how to make a map) this doesn't make any sense at all.

The reason for why I'm asking for settings and features is the fact that a lot of people don't like the thought of playing a random game. This is why I made a custom game creator where players can make their own gamemode with their own settings and features and then they can create and share their own custom game with the help of the creator. I don't think that a lot of people want to use the custom game creator to play a game like the one that you've described. In the same way that you can't set all game modes in a football game into "custom game" it's pointless to do this with a game like the battle royale game that you made, if you really don't want to make a game with specific settings and features that isn't a random game, like I did.

Also, I am glad you've seen the point that I was getting at.

This is the other reason why I made this thread.

This doesn't mean that my way of thinking is wrong, because I don't think it is. It's just the exact thing that this post is about. I'm saying that for most people who doesn't want to play a random game, we should create a custom game where they can also choose what they want to put in their game. That's why I think it makes sense to use a map maker and this way we can have something that is more "customizable" so to say.

I could go on and on, but I think I've made it clear enough that I think this is the way that makes sense to play a game like the battle royale game I have here.

If you haven't noticed, my point is that you should be able to just make your own "custom game" instead of "spawning mod". To make a custom game and be able to customize it, you need more options like a list of possible spawnpoints, maybe a list of possible gamemodes and other settings that can be customized for the game. Not spawning games from a random spawn point with no options makes no sense. That's what makes it so redundant and that's why the custom game creator is there to do something about it.

I'll just try to keep it as simple as possible. You don't have to say a word if you don't want to. The point I'm trying to get across is, as you can see I already tried to explain my position with my response from an old post of mine. I'm</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:33
