food and drink at its three locations: 
1139 Franklin Road, 
2045 Hilliard-Rome Road, 
and  2317 Sawgrass Landing Blvd. 
The Bar & Grill at the Sawgrass Landing is open daily from 11am to 1am, and you can find more information on its website. 
It's the closest of Joe's locations to the Taste of Avondale and the new Barclays Center, so if you're looking for lunch, dinner or a snack, swing by this summer.
For those in search of more than a drink and snack, visit Joe's Tiki Bar, open Tuesday to Sunday from 4pm to 2am.
