What's the quickest way to get a list of all unread Emails from all mailboxes in Outlook 2010?

What's the quickest way to get a list of all unread Emails from all mailboxes in Outlook 2010 ?
The below process is a bit cumbersome and takes about 2-3 minutes.
I've tried the below macro but it does not work on Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2003.
Option Explicit

Sub Test()

    Dim objOutlook As Object
    Dim objNameSpace As Object
    Dim objFolder As Object
    Dim objFolderItem As Object
    Dim objMailItem As Object
    Dim objUnreadEmail As Object
    Dim intLoop As Integer

    '~~> Specify which outlook version you are using
    'Set objOutlook = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")

    '~~> Get Outlook Instance
    Set objOutlook = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")

    '~~> Get the namespaces collection for Outlook
    Set objNameSpace = objOutlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")

    '~~> Start the loop to get all the folders in the inbox
    For intLoop = 1 To objNameSpace.Folders.Count

        '~~> Get the next folder in the folder collection
        Set objFolder = objNameSpace.Folders.Item(intLoop)

        '~~> Process the current Inbox
        objFolder.ProcessAllFolders (olFolderInbox)

    Next

    '~~> Loop through all Inbox Items and delete the read ones
    For Each objFolderItem In objFolder.Items
        For Each objMailItem In objFolderItem.UnRead
            objMailItem.Delete
        Next
    Next

    Set objNameSpace = Nothing
    Set objFolder = Nothing
    Set objFolderItem = Nothing
    Set objMailItem = Nothing

End Sub

A:

I've had good results with something like this:
Sub Test()

    Dim objOutlook As Object
    Dim objNameSpace As Outlook.NameSpace
    Dim folder As Outlook.Folder

    Dim subFolders As Outlook.Items
    Dim subFolderItem As Object

    '~~> Specify which outlook version you are using
    Set objOutlook = New Outlook.Application
    objOutlook.Session.Logon
    Set objNameSpace = objOutlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")

    '~~> Specify which folder you are working with
    Set folder = objNameSpace.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox)

    '~~> Process all sub folders, and unread email items in each sub folder
    For Each subFolder In folder.Folders
        For Each subFolderItem In subFolder.Items
            If subFolderItem.UnRead = True Then
                subFolderItem.Delete
            End If
        Next
    Next

    Set folder = Nothing
    Set subFolders = Nothing
    Set subFolderItem = Nothing

End Sub

What it does is that it gets the default folder (usually Inbox), and from there it loops through every subfolder, and then through all of their emails, to check if the email is unread or not.
Edit: In your case, you need to change this line:
For Each objFolderItem In objFolder.Items

To:
For Each objFolderItem In objFolder.Items.Restrict("[UnRead = True]")

This will only select folders and sub-folders that have unread messages.
You can download my open-source code here

While the other answer will work perfectly for most people, you may want to keep in mind that you can have "read" emails in the folder. You might want to do something like:
For i = 1 To objFolder.Items.Count
    On Error Resume Next
    If Not objFolder.Items(i).RestrictedViews.RestrictionType = 3 Then
        ' Do your delete code here.
    End If
Next

Basically if the item has any restriction, don't even process the item.

I think a quick macro to test, on Outlook 2010:
Option Explicit
Sub GetAllEmailsNotRead()

    Dim ns As Outlook.NameSpace
    Dim colFolders As Outlook.Folders
    Dim fld As Outlook.Folder

    Set ns = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI")
    Set colFolders = ns.Folders

    For Each fld In colFolders
        fld.ProcessAllFolders (olFolderInbox)
        fld.Items.Restrict("[UnRead]").Delete
    Next fld

    Set fld = Nothing
    Set colFolders = Nothing
    Set ns = Nothing

End Sub

EDIT1: Note that the "UnRead" method of Outlook (2003 and 2007+) will not return emails that have been marked as read by the user.  If you want to find emails that have not been read by anyone (as far as Outlook knows) then use Outlook.MailItems.Restrict([UnSeen]). See this article for more info.
