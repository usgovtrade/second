you'r dancing the salsa.
mamma said I want to learn the salsa too.
But mamma, you're gonna need to learn how to 
dance the cha-cha
first.
Do you really know how to dance?
Yes.
Then show me how you're doing that.
You're a little bit off.
You need to stand closer to each other, 
like this. 
[He leans in to her]
Not that close.
OK, then let's do it again.
Stand closer, like this.
That's it, good!
Yeah, that's it.
You need to dance much closer.
You're too close.
Let's try it again.
You're still a little too close.
Ok!
You're good, keep doing that.
Stand like that. 
[He leans in]
Not that close.
Keep dancing!
I don't know if you can tell, but I've been 
looking at my dance moves.
I see, you've improved.
Ok!
No, that's not it.
Now what?
I'll be the dancer and you dance behind 
me.
Ok, we'll be like this.
[He stands still and she follows her moves.]
That's what you should do.
I have to try it again.
Ok, let's do it again.
First we need to do some practice.
First I'll teach you how to dance the 
cha-cha.
Ready?
[They follow her moves]
We need to dance even closer.
[He teaches her how to dance the cha-cha]
Ok, you're almost there.
Ok, ok.
This is wrong, let me show you.
Ok.
We need to walk just a little bit faster.
Ok, try it out.
There, that's the cha-cha.
Right!
Ok, let's dance!
Ok.
OK!
It's the cha-cha!
Ok, ok, ok, ok.
Great job.
Ok.
[He dances the cha-cha with her]
Ok, that's right.
Ok!
I think I'm ready for the salsa.
OK.
Good!
Yeah, I think I can do this.
Ok, let's try it.
Ok, we'll show you how to do that.
Let's dance!
Ok, I'll teach you the steps.
Ok, ready?
Ok, here we go.
Ok.
OK, here we go!
Now I'll teach you how to dance 
the salsa.
Ok, here we go.
OK, ready?
Ok, here we go.
Here's the move!
I think I got it.
Ok!
Good!
Ok!
That's it!
[Watching them dance makes them laugh.]
[They are enjoying it.]
OK!
You did a really good job.
Thanks.
No problem.
I'm happy that we can dance together. 
We're friends now.
And I'm also glad that my wife is a good 
dancer.
I'm sorry that I'm not as good as you 
are, but next time
I'll try even harder.
I think you'll be able to dance the 
salsa after a while.
Hey, we should practice more.
Yeah!
Good!
Hey, let's have fun!
Ok.
Are you ready to go back to your house?
Let's go!
I'm so glad to have you as a friend.
We're still dancing, don't worry.
Let's have fun together!
[We laugh together.]
I think she's ready to go now.
Wow, you did a really good job!
I'm not a good dancer.
You are!
Let's go!
Great!
Let's go!
Let's practice some more.
[They start to move.]
Ready?
Let's go.
Yes!
[They go along with the music.]
[The music stops and they stand in silence.]
Ok!
You did really well.
I'm proud of you.
You can go home now.
Oh, thank you so much for coming 
all the way out here!
I am!
Yes, you really did a great job!
You're a good teacher.
You're a good dancer.
My friend, come here!
Let's practice more.
[He teaches her how to do the salsa.]
Let's go!
Hey, you did a great job!
Good job, my friend.
Yes!
Now we'll do the salsa again.
Let's go.
Let's dance!
This is the salsa.
Now we're good dancers.
[They move along to the music.]
[They laugh and move to the rhythm of the 
salsa.]
[His sister comes to the door and lets 
them dance]
[they dance well together.]
Thanks, my sister.
Ok, good job!
See you later, bye!
