Make changes to foods and their effect on cholesterol.

_Coconut Oil_. For decades scientists have been conducting studies to discover the health benefits of coconut oil, as coconut trees are a major staple crop in the tropical countries of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Coconut oil has a low melting point—about 95°F (35°C)—and is solid at room temperature. When it becomes liquid at body temperature, it can replace butter, margarine, and vegetable oil in cooking.

Coconut oil is about 70 percent medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and is made up of capric, caprylic, and lauric acid (MCFAs are not found in any other oil). The MCFAs are a more easily absorbed source of dietary fat than long-chain triglycerides. A single tablespoon of coconut oil provides 40 to 60 grams of energy, mostly from the MCFAs. Coconut oil also has other health benefits—specifically, research shows that it can lower bad cholesterol by increasing the amount of bile acids in the digestive tract, which helps remove cholesterol from the blood.

Research at the University of Guam's International Medical Center looked at the effects of a traditional Papua New Guinean diet on cholesterol. Women who ate a traditional diet high in coconut oil had total and LDL cholesterol levels that were 38 and 23 percent lower than those of women on a Western diet.

Coconut oil does not go rancid and is completely edible—including heated coconut oil. This makes coconut oil a natural preservative and keeps all sorts of canned goods from going bad. The one drawback to coconut oil is its high saturated fat content, which is why it should be combined with olive oil and/or canola oil when making a salad dressing or cooking with olive oil.

When cooking with coconut oil, use it cold and keep it cool, as it will solidify at a higher temperature.

Most coconut oil sold in North America is processed using an unhealthy method to separate out the coconut milk and discard the solids. Coconut oil with its large amount of saturated fat is better for cooking than for eating cold, as it turns from liquid to solid as it cools. That's why some of the "coconut milk" you buy in the refrigerated section is actually light coconut cream. It's not bad for you, just not as good as the real thing. The exception to this is virgin coconut oil, which is manufactured by cold-pressing the coconut meat and then heating it to separate out the oil. Virgin coconut oil comes from the fresh meat of a coconut tree—meaning, no chemical processing.

If your local health food store has coconut milk, ask if it is processed in a way that keeps the butterfat (oil) and defatted portion separate. Coconut milk can be purchased inexpensively at Indian, Asian, and Caribbean grocery stores, too.

You can purchase virgin coconut oil at Indian and Asian stores or in the freezer section of some mainstream supermarkets. Buy an organic variety if you can afford it—the nonorganic ones are often filled with chemicals. Because virgin coconut oil is less processed and will not have undergone high-heat pasteurization, you should keep it refrigerated and use within 3 to 4 months. This is true for both virgin and regular coconut oil, and the best quality coconut oil will be in the refrigerator section. In fact, use it cold! This will help prolong the use of the oil by slowing oxidation and rancidity.

Buy coconut oil in a one- or two-pound package, not in a quart. A two-pound package costs under $5 and contains about four tablespoons. To use, place the oil in a crock or jar in your refrigerator. Cover it with a tight-fitting lid. You can start using the oil after about a week by placing some in a small bowl. You can then begin using it to sauté, fry, or stir-fry. I suggest you try a small bowl first to see if you like its taste before you buy a large container. There is an interesting product on the market called "coconut oil cooking spray," which contains only coconut oil. This is great for stir-frying or as a coating for meats and fish before baking or grilling. Keep in mind that regular cooking oil may be mixed with other cheaper oils. This is why I recommend choosing a brand with only coconut oil as an ingredient.

**Q:** How does coconut oil have a low cholesterol and triglyceride content?

**A:** Coconut oil is rich in lauric acid. Lauric acid is a type of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that has remarkable health benefits. An added plus is that lauric acid is a natural preservative that makes food taste good and is resistant to bacteria. When used in food, coconut oil lowers the "bad" cholesterol and raises "good" cholesterol (the HDL cholesterol). As a result of all this, some scientists call coconut oil the "most important nutraceutical ever discovered."

**Wheat Bran Cereal**. This fiber-rich product is made from the outer husks of wheat that have been ground into flour. Wheat bran contains many good cholesterol-lowering substances, including plant protein and a B-vitamin complex. Other good sources of fiber are brown rice and oat bran.

**Herbs**

Use herbs to flavor soups, sauces, and salads—or just add them fresh to the plate. But remember to use smaller amounts. Herbs aren't low in calories or saturated fat like vegetables are, but they have health benefits that aren't usually found in meat and other animal products.

**Flaxseed**. When choosing between flaxseed oil and nuts, try flaxseed. Flaxseed has less saturated fat than most nuts and much of it is omega-3 fatty acids (an excellent heart-healthy fat). It's also higher in protein, fiber, and iron. Flaxseed also has no cholesterol or lactose. That makes it perfect for vegetarians who must be careful of what they eat to avoid cholesterol.

Flaxseed can be found in the vitamin section of most supermarkets and is usually found in the baking aisle. You can also find it at health food stores and at some grocery stores that sell bulk foods. Flaxseed can be stored at room temperature in an airtight jar or bag.

Make a salad dressing by combining 2 parts flaxseed oil and 1 part canola oil with 2 parts vinegar and ¼ to ½ teaspoon of Dijon mustard. Add fresh chopped herbs. For salads and cooking, grind fresh flaxseed between two plates in a hand-crank (or similar) coffee grinder.

**Fats**

**Canola Oil**. Although canola oil has been highly touted for its nutritional value and heart-health benefits, these claims have not been completely proven. There are some questions about which part of canola oil is most beneficial. Canola oil is high in monounsaturated fats. This means that monounsaturated fat and omega-3 fatty acids are located in this particular oil. Unlike polyunsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids, monounsaturated fat and omega-3 fatty acids have not been found to protect against heart disease, according to the American Heart Association. Additionally, a review of the research suggests that saturated fats may offer more health benefits than polyunsaturated fat.

Nevertheless, a study in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ recommended that canola oil replace saturated fat in the diet because canola oil contains linolenic acid, which is converted to omega-3 fatty acids in the body. As far as the canola oil's omega-3 fatty acids go, they are better than most other sources.

Canola oil has a light taste and is used for salad dressings, sauces, and marinades. Cook with canola oil, because it has a higher smoke point (450°F or about 230°C) than olive oil (370°F or about 190°C) and can withstand higher temperatures. The smoke point means that the oil will not burn and release free radicals. If you choose canola oil, be aware that it has a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids, which many researchers believe contribute to diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, and premature aging. This is why olive oil and canola oil should be used together or you should add other healthy fats like sunflower or sesame seed oils. You can also reduce the amount of canola oil you use by mixing it with olive oil. (See the "Other Options" sidebar on page 26.)

**Olive Oil**. As with canola oil, there are many contradictory studies about olive oil. Most physicians agree that this is one of the most important oils in the Mediterranean diet. Mediterranean diets are low in saturated fats and high in monounsaturated fats. The research shows that a diet low in saturated fats and high in monounsaturated fats can help protect against heart disease. One of the main reasons for this may be that monounsaturated fats lower cholesterol levels. Research in recent years has shown that the Mediterranean diet helps prevent heart disease. Eating a diet that is high in monounsaturated fat has been linked to a decrease in high cholesterol, a decrease in the risk of stroke, and a decrease in the risk of heart attacks. One study showed a reduction in heart disease when subjects substituted monounsaturated fat for saturated fat (i.e., eating olive oil rather than saturated fats).
