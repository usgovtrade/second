Thanks Paul.  I think this is great news for us because it looks like we 
should be able to call on them much earlier.  I will talk to Chris to see 
what we can do.

Bloomberg New Energy to Sell $300 Million in November Bond Offers
11/19/0 17:12 (New York)

New York, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a major
capital markets provider for the alternative energy industry, said that it
will sell $300 million in November in bond sales in the United States and
Canada. The company plans to price the bonds at par, or 100 cents on the
dollar.

We currently have about $750 million in outstanding issues. I assume these
are mostly in the money.

P.S. Have you priced the bonds? What are you thinking?
