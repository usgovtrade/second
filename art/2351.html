oath of the Fraternity. This is, after all, what the secret oath of the
"Blue Beetle" was--a summons to fight the battle of the Red or the Black.

Why is it that the Black is thought to be so dreadful a colour? Is it
not because it is so near to the Red? The Red is so near to the Black
that even now we should scarcely call any thing black which was not
really red. And this brings us back to the Red, which is so near to the
White, as it is only those colours which are near to one another which
really stand out as black and white. The Red and the White, therefore,
are the Black and White of Nature, or, if you prefer it, of Nature and
Happiness. We now know why Shakespeare calls Night "a worm of wrath."
We now understand why many ancient myths associate blackness with evil
things, darkness with disease. We now know the reason why modern medical
men look upon a red and a white patient as two quite different cases,
not merely as two differently-coloured cases.

When we have the real principles underlying our thought about
colours--and this seems to be practically unknown, even to modern
psychologists--we shall not look at the various colours of Nature in
a mere subjective way, as so many different sorts of paint with which
we happen to be impressed, but rather in the light of the principle of
Harmony. We shall know that the real basis of all colour is Harmony.
And then we shall know why black is not always bad and why it is not
necessarily associated with "evil things." So far from black being an
ugly colour, it often looks very pretty when there is harmony in the
colouring of Nature or in the surroundings of Nature's creatures. The
black-bird, for instance, is one of the prettiest birds, as you can see
in the picture. But the fact is that the bird and his surroundings have
black _and white_ intermingled.

If you take two colours and throw them together, you get a new colour
not present in either of them taken separately. So if you take a black
bird and a white bird and put them together, you get a third colour,
which is neither black nor white, but which is more than the sum of the
parts. It is a kind of a greyish brown, or pale grey. This is Nature's
taste in the matter of colours. We should all agree that there is
a good deal of merit in this "harmonious scheme" in Nature.


VI.--COLOUR TAUGHT BY THE BRAIN

Let us next ask, what kind of a thing is a brain, and what is it for?
You see a child jumping up and down at play. Does that child imagine
that the jumping is the jumping of itself? No, you may be sure that
the child knows that it is not the child jumping, and in fact believes
that it is not the child. Does the child believe that the jumping is the
jumping of a _stick_ or of a _ball_? No, you may be sure that it knows
that it is not a stick or a ball that is being jumped. In fact, you may
fairly say that the child knows what a brain is for. And if the child
knew what the brain was for, he would also know what his brain was doing
when it jumped, jumping as it did. Suppose there was no brain in his
body. There is no doubt that he would be jumping up and down quite as
well, but that would not be jumping; it would be the jumping of a _stick_
or of a _ball_--that is, jumping the jumping.

It is quite certain, then, that the child knows that he has a brain.
If he did not, he would say, "I am not the child; the child is jumping
up and down; it is not me." He knows that he is not the jumping, but
he is not the jumping either; so we may fairly say that he knows that
he has got a brain. And yet--and this is very important--he knows that
the brain is not doing the jumping. How does he know it? He is aware of
the fact that he is having the sensation of jumping, but he knows that
it is not _he_ that is jumping. How does he know this? He can see, and
he can feel, and he can hear; and thus he knows.

The child also knows that he cannot jump _himself_, and that he cannot
jump with the jumping. He knows that he is not a thing that jumps, any
more than a dog is a thing that barks. It is important to remember that
he knows this. If you do not make any distinction between the one who
barks and the one who jumps, if you do not make any distinction between
the animal that barks and the animal that jumps, then you will put
yourself into trouble. You will think that if you jump it is _you_ that
jump, that if you see something jump it is _you_ that see it jump, and
that you will jump yourself! It is very easy to fall into such confusion
when we are dealing with thought or thought-processes.

But the important point is this: We have learned in chapter ii. that a
human being does not think in thoughts. A child does not think of jumping
_himself_. He thinks, or thinks of, the jumping of a human being. And
yet he knows that he is not a human being, though he is a human being.
We see the distinction clearly enough in cases of insanity. For example,
a lunatic may imagine that he is a king, or a general, or something of
that sort, when, as a matter of fact, he is an ordinary working man,
who is not, and never was, king or general; or, again, a lunatic may
consider himself to be a dog, when he is an ordinary human being, who
is not, and never was, a dog. So the lunatic does not believe his
illusions, though he believes them; and he imagines that he is thinking
of things which he is not thinking of. He is not himself the person who
thinks of kings or generals. He is simply imagining something which he
thinks of. He may even imagine that he is imagining it. So that it is
quite clear that he knows that he has a brain and that he is not himself
the thinker of the thoughts.

When you understand this, you will understand that it is quite
legitimate for the child to think that the jumping is the jumping of a
_brain_. The brain thinks of the jumping, and yet it is not itself the
jumping. If it were, it would jump itself; but it does not. And that is
precisely why the child knows that he has a brain and why he knows that
he does not jump himself. He is clear on the fact that the jumping is
the jumping of a _brain_, and he knows that the brain is _not_ himself,
or rather does _not_ himself jump, and is in fact _not_ a jumping thing
at all.

This kind of argument about the brain is entirely different from the
idea of the Cartesian dualism, which said that the mind is different
from the body and is _res cogitans_, whereas the body is _res extensa_.
That is a mistake. The Cartesian dualism is a bad error; for the fact
is that the mind is itself a body, although it is not _res extensa_,
but is in a sense dual, or double, in itself. This is illustrated by
the child who imagines that he is the jump and is not the jump. The
child knows that he is not himself the jumping, because he is the one
thinking the jumping. The mind is, as it were, a dual thing, the jumping
and the thinking. There are, then, two things to the mind: the one being
a bodily thing and the other being a mental thing. You cannot separate
mind from matter; nor, as we have now seen, can you separate them into
two different things. There is only one single thing--namely, Mind--with
which mind and matter and all other objects are concerned, and of which
both are in some sort a part.

If you ask why we call the brain a thinking thing, that is just because
it thinks, or it is capable of thinking. It is because of the thinking
capability that the brain is itself called "brain," just as a chair is
called "chair" because it is capable of holding people when they are
sitting on it. It is because of the mental capacity that the mind is
called "mind," just as the mouth is called "mouth" because it can utter
words.

We have learned in chapter iii. that a real thought is not a "proposition"
to which you must assent and to which you must give your assent. It is
a feeling in which you have to believe, if you are to believe at all.
This is what is meant when you say that</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:22
