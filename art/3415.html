How long will this last?

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children posted a fact sheet that explains how the site can't be used to file charges against people.

"The FBI's Cyber Crime and Computer Intrusion Section works to identify users who have received those images and, when possible, to notify victims about their identities," the fact sheet said.

How are authorities using the video?

The U.S. Attorney's Office on Monday issued a statement saying that authorities have identified at least 1,000 "pre-identified child pornographers" in the cyberstalking case.

"This particular case of cyberstalking is very different than other cases in that a video showing sexual exploitation of minors was given to the FBI. That is why there has been public interest in this case," A. David Stoll, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, said in a statement. "It is one of the earliest attempts to apply technology in the public interest for identifying child pornographers."

Have there been any arrests yet?

No. But authorities said they intend to pursue child porn convictions with help from the video.

When will the cyberstalking charges go to trial?

They will go to trial in September on the cyberstalking charges and January on the child porn charges. The trial of Christopher Lee Rogers, 43, of Union, Mo., was continued by St. Clair County Circuit Judge Terry Lynn Brown on Monday. He'll return on March 18.

Can child porn be used as evidence in court?

Yes.

The case involving two men and a teenage boy is an example of how prosecutors use child porn evidence in court. The prosecution says the two men engaged in sex with the teenager in March 2012, and he recorded them. One of the men was in possession of a cellphone that investigators traced back to Rogers, who was later charged with attempting to use the child porn as part of a plot to blackmail his family.

"This case also involves the seizure and search of defendant Rogersâ€™ computer hard drive," prosecutors wrote. "That computer hard drive was subject to a forensic examination and analysis and it revealed in his computer files child pornography.

"After review and analysis, investigators traced the e-mail address and internet service provider used by defendant Rogers to log into the website on which he made contact with his intended victim."

What else do we know?

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Rogers, posing as a father of a teenage boy, asked to take explicit photos and videos of the teenager while they were driving a truck, with Rogers in the passenger seat and the teenager at the wheel.

The boy and Rogers drove together to another location where Rogers performed a sex act on the teenager. The teen recorded the encounter with his cellphone. Rogers tried to talk the teen into having sex with him, saying "nobody will find out," but he was "caught red-handed," prosecutors say.

Two other men have been charged in the child porn case. Their trials are pending, but not yet set.

"What I am seeing is that the FBI is becoming more and more accustomed to using cyber technology," said Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for the FBI in St. Louis. "This is a unique instance of investigators using modern technology to identify child pornographers. This is a really big deal because they are trying to work with the Internet, they are using people to bring them to justice."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:11
