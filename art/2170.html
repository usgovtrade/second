I'm On a Road Trip

I have a plan this year. I'm really going to focus and write more. All I need is ten people to check out my Patreon site, make a pledge, and in exchange I'll give you access to articles and other cool things. Seriously, I've been keeping all the behind-the-scenes content, writing videos and more for a while, and now it's time to actually do something with it. I will be working very closely with my writers, so if you want to make sure your name is on a joke or a story, or if you have a project you want me to produce, sign up now. You don't want to miss this.

All good things to those who wait (Jennie T Wallach)

I'm writing every week. Writing is my new gig. If you haven't seen me in a few weeks you have probably missed my weekly video, but if you feel like catching up, this is the place to do it. Come and join me in the last three minutes of the week as I share something silly and stupid about who I've been and how much I love you all. The format will remain the same, but with more stories about my daughter, about people not listening to me, and an increasing number of stories about sex and sex talk. I'll be putting all my best writing in one place, so if you like it I hope you'll support me while I put these together. Also I promise I will never leave you again. Promise!

I'm writing this while on vacation with my wife. It's been a really tough year for me and while I don't have any big news about it, things have changed. I've found my voice again and I've started to look towards my future, which as I mentioned last year, is terrifying. I really thought I'd be retired by now, and just having retired is something that scares the hell out of me. At the end of the day I'm still a comics nerd, so I'm going to keep making this funny weird weirdos as long as I can.

On the way to the airport last night, I heard the last of my best friend, a man whom I called my brother for three years, had passed away. It's terrible to lose someone you know so intimately. He was one of those guys who lived on the edge, and it's true he was kind of a mess, but he was funny as hell.

I don't even want to write about this, but his family has asked me to put something up about what he meant to me and how much I miss him. My brother was always my favorite guy on earth. For a while, a long while, he was my only friend. I can't imagine it getting any easier and neither can anyone else.

I guess the only good news about this is that at least he didn't die in a car crash and we could make funny jokes about it. Instead he died from depression. And even that is terrible because it could have been avoided if he had taken some time off, or if he'd told someone how he felt.

I loved him and I am going to miss him. He made me laugh until I could barely breathe, and every story I ever read to him is one I'll never forget. He didn't like to talk about himself much, but I want you all to know how much he meant to me. He saved my life and I'll never forgive myself for what I did to him. I love you, David, and I know your kids will remember you.

I didn't know him very well, but I still can't believe this happened. I will never stop missing him and I will always regret what happened. He was the happiest, most optimistic guy I ever knew, and I'm just...I can't. I don't know what to do with this. I can't even type.

It is too easy to imagine these big moments. I try and imagine myself standing in front of the audience, at a party or a show, feeling like they are looking at me. When I hear the laughter and the applause, I imagine myself feeling better for it, a little lighter, maybe like I've done something right. But when I write it like that, it sounds like a lie because sometimes it feels like I've done something wrong.

There have been a lot of times this year that I didn't feel like writing a thing, or even talking to anyone. Sometimes I was just in my own stupid head, feeling mad about my life, but when I couldn't get back into it, it was impossible to write anything funny. But I did because I have to. I have to live up to what I've done and not take a single fucking day for granted, because I don't deserve it.

I have to write every day. I can't imagine that ever changing. The good and the bad, I just keep thinking about the kids in that school. I just remember how that one class changed everything, but I never let myself forget how much it hurt when they died, and I can't find the words to tell you how I feel about it.

I don't want to think about it either, but I can't stop thinking about it, because it is a miracle that anyone survived. To me it seems like everything that happened that day is just awful. I know I should think about it more deeply, but the only thing I can do about any of this is joke about it, but also acknowledge the truth of it all. I can't stop thinking about that day and I'm sorry to anyone who's had to read this and also sorry that you are going to get through this year with a less depressing letter. I'll try to talk about less bad things, but for now, I just want to stop and tell you what a great friend you are. Thank you.

Please check out my Patreon site. If you'd like to make a small donation of support to my writing, and make sure I'm able to do this for you and for everyone, and have some really great rewards, please support me on Patreon.

Thank you all for all you've given me. I love you all.

I'm in the market for new jokes

I started writing for the internet in the middle of one of the worst years of my life, but over the course of the last year or so I have made a name for myself, I have made friends, and I've been lucky enough to do some things that most of you probably won't see. There are a lot of comics you can watch in places like Netflix or HBO GO and there are no shortage of shows about the internet or talking heads that I can find on places like Hulu. I think of comedy the way my dad thinks of a sandwich—there are not enough for me. So when I make a reference to a story or a joke I hear that doesn't exist, I usually find it extremely hard to be interested in the next bit that I hear. And that's probably a good thing because</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:05
