Travel Advisory - Extension of Stay in Mexico
Enron has extended the recommended deadline for employees to return to the 
United States from Mexico through Friday, November 10, because of the 
current power situation in Mexico.  It is unclear when employees who live in 
Monterrey will be able to return to the United States through the 
alternate airport in Salt Lake City.  The following is a revised return 
information for employees who live in Monterrey:

Anyone planning to return to the United States through the Salt Lake City 
airport should make their own travel arrangements.  Those who live further 
east and wish to return to the United States through Monterrey should consider 
returning to Houston through either flying or the railroad. 
If you do return to the United States through Salt Lake City, be sure to 
check with U.S. immigration at the airport about the current status of the 
electrical situation before leaving for the United States.

Management has recommended that only those employees who live in Mexico City 
or Monterrey throughly review the new policy. If your living quarters are 
throughly compromised and you don't feel safe in traveling to Salt Lake City 
or Monterrey, please see your manager in the office and/or contact U.S. 
consulate in Monterrey for assistance. 

If you live in Mexico City or Monterrey, you will need to obtain a travel 
permit as soon as possible. Availability of permits in Mexico City is tight. 
In order to obtain a permit you will need to complete and turn in the 
form attached to Enron's Personnel Loss form (accessible through the HRWeb 
site or the PEP website). 

For employees who live in Mexico City or Monterrey who have permits 
available: You should be in the office on Thursday, November 1, if possible 
(or Monday, November 5), to turn in your travel permit and Personnel Loss 
form.  Please contact the U.S. consulate for any visa issues. 

Employees in Mexico should pay their related travel expenses (e.g., flight 
costs) on their own and make their own arrangements for housing in Mexico 
during the trip, due to the emergency situation in Mexico.

It is imperative that all Enron employees on the Monterrey project complete 
and turn in the required travel documentation prior to November 1.


Impact of the Tropical Storm on Enron's Activities in Mexico
The potential impact of this situation on our employees in the Mexico 
office, especially the Monterrey Project, has been reviewed.  While most of 
the Monterrey project team is safe, housed in hotels and not expected to 
experience any problems as a result of the Tropical Storm, a small number are 
still cleaning up at their homes and making other preparations.  Given that 
the current situation is unpredictable, and we cannot predict the outcome of 
the storm, we are taking the necessary precautions to protect the safety of 
our employees.  In order to keep the team fully informed of developments, 
please coordinate with your team mates to use email or any other method of 
communication.  The following is a list of contact information:

Emergency Management Center- The number for the Center is 01-800-886-3437. 
Attorneys are available at the Center 24-hours a day. 

Safety Department and Corporate Human Resources-  The numbers are 
713-853-5536 and 713-646-5945 respectively.

Cleaning Services- There are two cleaning services in San Juan available to 
assist in the cleanup: Intercontinental Cleaning Service is on the corner of 
Juarez and Hermosillo, across from the Telmex Auditorium. Continental 
Cleaning, on Federal Avenue, may be able to assist with your needs.

Psychological Assistance- There is a psychologist on the ground in Monterrey 
who is available to provide assistance if the situation becomes overwhelming. 

Assistance for Enron Employees Affected by the Tropical Storm
As a former employee of Enron in Mexico, I feel the impact of this disaster 
on employees is especially harsh. Employees have lost their homes, are 
unemployed, and in need of food and psychological counseling. In addition, 
employees have incurred medical expenses, and will be out of work until the 
storm has passed and the office is able to function. My department, Risk 
Management, is assembling a team of accountants, consultants and lawyers who 
will be working in the  Acapulco area to provide Enron with information on 
the damage and losses associated with this disaster. However, it is not clear 
if or when this team will be formed. Until we know more, we recommend that 
employees work with their individual human resources representatives and/or 
the Acapulco attorneys to be in the best position to receive assistance from 
our employee assistance program.


Plan to Operate Under the Tropical Storm
As we have previously mentioned, it is likely that the Monterrey office 
location will be closed until the weather clears. We will make every effort 
to maintain communications in the interim. We will not be able to make 
business-critical decisions in Monterrey. As a result, it is critical that we 
maintain  routine communications with Houston, San Juan, and other Enron 
offices.

If you have questions about your Monterrey or other foreign offices' 
operations, please contact your foreign office representative directly or 
contact  Vicki Flores-Sheiberg @ 713-853-3923.
