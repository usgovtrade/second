Trade-war shortcuts and FBA-FPS-RBA trading, AAPL-WMT

It was so interesting.

The AAPL stock has been moving up and down. A trader in Singapore (in his tweet) had posted that he is about to cash out $100k worth of AAPL.

But since Friday, the stock has started a downward trend. When the AAPL stock has been moving up, in the previous 4-5 days, I have been trading FBA, the spread between the $AAPL/WMT. Recently, the AAPL stock had rallied to a certain level and the price of FBA had reached $30. I was looking to sell the WMT or even the FBP.

Yesterday, a trader bought the FBA and paid the premium. But today, I was able to sell the FBA at a premium. Since the price of FBA was cheaper and also had a higher than expected premium, I bought in my own trade a little bit of FBA.

Last week, I was able to buy the VLO, with a cheaper price and higher premium. I was looking to sell VLO last week as well but the price did not drop as much as I expected.

So far I was able to cash out about $900 from this trade. Now I need to see if I want to buy back in and sell WMT, or buy the FBP.

Today, I will try to sell FBP and also take some profit from my portfolio. If the price of FBP has dropped a little bit, I will buy FBP.

AAPL will probably be dropping. I believe the trade war will be ongoing until some big decision is made, and they are ready to talk. There is a sense that this will be a long, drawn-out trade war. I can see that the US wants to keep playing the role of a superpower. In the past, when big country tries to bully others, other countries would rally around. So far, Europe has not woken up to what is going on. But one day they will wake up.

I like the chart of AAPL on a daily basis. The price of AAPL had went through the resistance and had an upward rally. It seemed like a good buy for this time frame. On the longer time frame, the rally was stopped. I feel like there is a lot of uncertainty in this trade right now, even though the rally looks good. If there is a big sell-off today, I will have a hard time finding a good trade in AAPL.

I believe it is because of the uncertainty of the trade war, which is also uncertain and will last for a long time. With uncertainty, it is difficult to find a trade that offers a good risk-reward ratio.

WMT has reached new highs. I am not interested in buying into WMT now. I was not very interested in the stock last year. I think it might be a good time to hold onto a portfolio and watch what happens with the price. The risk is a little bit lower than it was in June, when the earnings were released. The risk-reward ratio is not good enough for me to buy more WMT.

BAT also made a new high, but I do not care about the stock.

FBP is holding up well, and I like the chart. When FBP was trading at $50, I was ready to buy it. At that time, FBP was trading above the 200 DMA. I was looking for a stock that had a lot of upside potential. I think it is good to take a look at when there are many stocks trading at a cheaper price.

I believe it is a good time to buy because this is not a momentum stock. It is trading below the 200 DMA, which means that it has not been going up steadily. The stock is being traded in a bearish market. If the price moves higher, it will be a momentum stock. If the price is going down, it is a bearish momentum stock.

I can’t say that the stock will go up by 200% to 200% the next couple of months. The fact that it had reached a new high at a good price might just be a coincidence. The stock is just over $50.

In addition, the stock had broken out of the resistance area. It is very possible that the price will go higher. When a stock goes higher, I have no reason to sell it.

There was some confusion when I called to the broker and mentioned my interest to buy WMT. The broker said that it is not possible because it is a limit order and I should buy it as a limit order. But the price is not over $60.

It seems that the broker is still trying to educate me on how to trade.

The following table shows all the stocks I traded today. When the price is below my buy price, I bought in as a limit order. And when the price is above my sell price, I sold as a limit order.

For more details, please refer to the table below. If you want to view the details of each trade, please click the image.

In general, I only use limit orders and I do not use OCO. In order to make a profit, I need to be able to place limit orders. If the stock is a strong stock and is going up, I can place a market order. However, I do not think that a strong stock is a good trader. If I place an OCO order, I might be too greedy and might end up being forced out of the market. And when the stock is dropping, if I close out my position too early, I would not make a profit.

I am in the business of making money. If I need to sell a stock for whatever reason, I will close out the position. I do not play the market to make a profit. I trade for the sake of making a profit. If I get excited about the price of the stock, I will consider adding a trade to my plan, if I feel that the price will go in that direction.

Today, I bought WMT at $48.60 and sold WMT at $48.55. The volume was low. My stop loss is $49.30, and the $4.80 difference between the buy price and the sell price. If the price of WMT goes down, the $4.80 will be a profit for me.

Trading VLO went well last week. I sold VLO yesterday and took a profit of $450. The price of VLO went higher. I would have sold even higher if I didn’t sell VLO and wait until the price went higher. I only had one VLO trading plan.

Today, I plan to cash out the VLO, because the price of VLO has a lower price and there is a $300 difference between my buy price and the sell price.

ROC was the first stock I bought at the start of the year. But then I realized that I should not have bought.

A.T. Kearney downgrade, AAPL vs VISA

In addition, AAPL (Apple) and Visa were given the downgrade by the company A.T. Kearney. The company does not like the risk of the stock.

The following table shows the details of each trading.

On the 1-month chart, the prices of the stock were very low. I felt that the trend would continue. I was looking at a big rebound, so I decided to buy AAPL. After I bought it, it dropped quite quickly.

But then it started to make a strong rebound. It’s like when a company with a high risk of bankruptcy has an IPO, and then a stock goes up to make a profit.

The stock has dropped quite a bit now, so there is a lot of downside risk. When I bought it, I was looking at the long term trend of the price. If I only look at the short term trend, it seems a little bit risky. For the long term trend, I think the stock is going to go higher.

After AAPL reached its new high and closed above $200, the IPO gave out a profit of $200 and it did not seem possible for the stock to drop to below $190. But the stock dropped below $190 last night, which surprised me. It was a surprise because of the recent resistance of the stock</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:22
