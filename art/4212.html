With John Cena leaving this summer, WWE has already announced a plan to have Daniel Bryan go to SummerSlam as the world champion. However, there is a rumor that may change that.

According to PWInsider, there is a plan that has John Cena making a surprise return to surprise Daniel Bryan and defeat him for the title at SummerSlam. The idea would be that John Cena returns as the new World Champion, while Daniel Bryan gets a rematch at Survivor Series in November.

This would be a huge shock as fans are already expecting Daniel Bryan to be the one going to the ring to face off against Brock Lesnar for the title at Survivor Series. WWE fans are saying that unless there is some great twist to this match, that Cena should take the title in a match that was not that much of a surprise considering how big of a deal it was already when Cena lost it.

This would be a major bombshell for fans to hear with so many big matches on the horizon already. But will it happen? At this point, WWE is reportedly telling everyone that this is not confirmed yet, but may be the case.

As of now, it seems unlikely that WWE would keep John Cena as champ going into WrestleMania 30 as things are looking pretty grim for him already. WWE may try to play off of this information as a rumor, but we could see it actually coming true if it's not put down to speculation.

John Cena and The Shield have been added to WWE's upcoming Hall of Fame ceremony

After many of the top stars in the WWE are inducted into the Hall of Fame, John Cena is going to be doing something special for his return to the company.

Cena, who announced back in February that he was going to be taking time off from the company to get the business back on track with his family and so on, is coming back at next year's Hall of Fame and he's bringing some company. In fact, he's bringing the whole Shield along with him as the trio will be inducted into the Hall of Fame with Cena.

This is not Cena's first Hall of Fame induction as he was previously inducted in 2012. At that time, The Rock was his co-presenter.

The Shield's first WWE Hall of Fame induction came in 2014. The trio of Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose were inducted.

No word yet on what the other inductees are for 2017 but it is sure to be a great night. No word yet on a possible date for the 2017 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony as of yet.

Shinsuke Nakamura has been working very hard to get back into the flow of things since he lost the United States title to Kota Ibushi at the New Year's Dash. However, now that he is going to be going on an international tour with Kota Ibushi, it seems that he is now able to get back to his full strength.

While Nakamura is currently not in the United States, he is in Mexico. Nakamura had a press conference today in Mexico where it seemed that Nakamura said that he is now able to get back to the type of moves that he was doing before he was hurt in January. Nakamura also said that he would have a new move which would be a "fire tornado."

It's now been said that Nakamura will be at the WrestleMania 31 card in Dallas, Texas and in order to get to the US, Nakamura will likely have to use something like his old fire tornado attack.

Of course, Nakamura has stated that he would be very open to fighting again in a world title match against AJ Styles. Styles ended his WWE contract back at Royal Rumble and as far as we can tell, he is not expected to return. There is a lot of speculation that AJ Styles will make a deal with the company as the company has not really found a suitable replacement for him in place.

Rumors of the WWE wanting to bring back the Intercontinental Championship have resurfaced this week. Apparently, Triple H wants to do something to help out fans who want the Intercontinental Championship back. As it stands right now, the WWE does not have the belt but they do have the United States championship. However, it was recently revealed that there is a possibility that Dolph Ziggler could get the title back and we know that Dolph is not going to turn down the opportunity.

Now, the question remains as to what will happen to the title if it does return. Will it still be defended on RAW and SmackDown or will it be taken off of the shows as well as being retired. We would imagine that if the belt is on the shows and AJ Styles has his United States championship title back, that it would make it seem to make sense. Otherwise, they could pull a TNA and give out a title that isn't even really being defended.

We also know that WWE is going to be hosting WrestleMania 31 on April 2. It has been said that the card will have a Hall of Fame match for the wrestling world, and it has been confirmed that the Hall of Fame match will feature Triple H versus Goldberg. Of course, Goldberg is returning on the April 3 episode of RAW.

As you can see, there is a lot going on with the company and the return of AJ.

It looks like WWE is continuing to make its plan for SummerSlam this Sunday.

We have seen a lot of speculation lately on whether John Cena will be able to take back the World title from Daniel Bryan at the Payback event. When talking with some people in the WWE, we got the opinion that WWE is indeed going to put Daniel Bryan over cleanly at the PPV. However, that does not mean that they are giving Cena the title because they are still saying that Daniel Bryan is the only man who can beat John Cena for the title at SummerSlam.

WWE also said that John Cena is currently training for his future return to action.

The new WWE champion for a short time was a surprise and may have actually come to a major surprise to some people who were expecting Bryan to be the one to win. It seems that WWE may have set the future plans in stone by announcing Bryan as the new champion just a few days after he won the title.

Daniel Bryan had no problem with this at all and said that he is really happy and content with what the company did in this situation. He stated that he is even proud of this moment and feels that he is going to be a great champion because he was not intimidated or scared at all about coming out of the gate as the new champ.

Now that the big night is coming up on Sunday, Daniel Bryan is getting himself in the proper mindset to take on Brock Lesnar in a huge SummerSlam event. However, Daniel Bryan was quick to respond to any talk of the title being taken away from him.

Daniel Bryan said that he is not scared of losing the belt and that he is very comfortable with the decision he made. He is also saying that he will not change anything he did to win the title because it worked out very well for him.

The new champion is also aware that there will be a lot of skepticism that has been cast on him. Bryan said that he hopes that this win will be respected as a big win in history. He believes that he has earned it and it seems that he thinks that there may be some people who may think he has an unfair advantage over John Cena but in his opinion, the fact is that there are plenty of examples of other former champions who had come back as champions and that Daniel Bryan is going to do that as well.

Now it is not entirely clear whether or not Daniel Bryan will be facing Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam, but it seems</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:10
