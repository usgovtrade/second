Of course, the idea of an original human nature may be considered to involve a denial of teleology in the first place, which would make the idea logically self-contradictory. However, an awareness of this self-contradiction does not itself eliminate the possibility of the idea, any more than a denial of space and time can deny the possibility of the idea of a vacuum or a denial of a certain type of necessity can negate the possibility of other types of necessity. The denial only removes this very specific possibility. REFERENCES Abbott, Andrew S., and James G. Stout. "The Idea of a Natural Right." Perspectives on Political Science 1 (1998): 5–28. Aristotle.
