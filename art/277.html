Then, suddenly, there it was. A long and thick vine of warts and black pockmarks that ran like a tapestry through the entire school. Quiggly was in complete awe and couldn't stop moving his eyes from every part of the vile thing as he started down into the darkness.

Quiggly thought he was at least 15 feet from the thing when he started feeling weird. He started feeling a little weak at his knees and he had a hard time breathing through his nose.

There was a brief moment of fear as Quiggly was unsure what to do. Then, he remembered the letter. He took it out of his pocket, opened it up and poured the powder onto his head.

He was now completely aware that what he was feeling was a black power of a person just about to happen. He could sense it. But no matter how much he steeled himself, he couldn't stop himself from freaking out.

Quiggly let out a small scream and the black figure started creeping forward toward the boy, who was trying his best not to run away.

The next thing Quiggly knew, he was being flung into the grass.

Walking up to him was the very worst thing that had ever happened to Quiggly.

The boy never felt a thing.

The one of the largest blackest men in the world sat on top of him. He wasn't a black man or a beast. The man was just a very tall black man.

Quiggly was screaming in his head, but couldn't cry out in any way. He couldn't feel any emotion in that body at all.

The black man in Quiggly's head told the boy that he was gonna get what he wanted. He was gonna do it his way. The black man pushed his shoulders until he stood up and then proceeded to walk him around.

A moment later the man was picking Quiggly up. And he carried him for the rest of his life.

The next thing Quiggly knew, he was being thrown into the grass. Walking up to him was the very worst thing that had ever happened to Quiggly. He didn't feel anything at all. He didn't feel any pain, nothing. He was terrified. He just watched as the hands that were on his body started cutting off his head.

As his hands went lower, Quiggly could see what the rest of the black figure was doing. He had two large black hands on each side of his head and was ripping his head off.

As Quiggly screamed for help, he saw the black figure in his head rip off the rest of his body.

Quiggly could hear his voice shouting, "Why do you do this to me? I don't know what I did to deserve this, I'm a good guy."

That last sentence became his name and what the body of his head was.

Quiggly remembered what he did with the letter that day.

He placed it on the ground where it originally fell and waited. He waited until something horrible was coming.

Quiggly watched the black figure of a man walk away. He started feeling his way back to where his body was. When he reached it, he could feel the blood was spilling out of his throat. His eyes and mouth were bleeding in the dirt.

The black head started to see through the vision of his own eyes. He saw himself. He knew what was happening. He had to do something, but he couldn't tell what.

He ran over to where his body was. It was on the ground covered in blood and the head was crying out, "Why me?"

He picked up a letter that was around the corpse. And read the last thing he wrote.

"Dear Evil, You are an abomination to creation. You shall be your own demise. You're a stupid black hole. Love, Quiggly."

When he returned, the head was waiting. He held it in his hands. "Why did you do this to me? I didn't do anything wrong. I was a good guy."

Quiggly was staring into the eyes of the black head and was about to feel something awful.

This was his punishment. It was because of what he did to the black figure. He deserved it, according to the head.

The black head looked at the letter he had and the words came back. "YOU DIE!"

The black head went to him and ripped off his own head, exposing the flesh behind it.

Quiggly felt nothing at all as the rest of his body disintegrated. The head of the vile man and the rest of his body were now nothing but a pile of ash and bones on the ground.

No matter how hard the head was looking, it was still going to be black.

The last thing Quiggly saw in this black world, was the hand coming up from the ground with the letter that he picked up when he found his body.

He read, "Love, Quiggly."

He never saw another human being in his entire life.

He never saw another human being in his entire life.

"I'm a good guy." He thought.
