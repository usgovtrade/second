distribute the load and we would like to try it on the West Desk load.  If 
this works we would like to start using it going forward for the new capacity 
for the East Desk and Tenaska IV Riverside.  Because of the time element 
involved for completion we need to get this on the system by the 24th of 
July.  The option is not currently available through lotus notes but as soon 
as the option is displayed in the "new" notes system, we will send the 
password and link to the West Desk Realtime person on the 24th.  Please call 
me if there is any problem with the 24th and we'll try to change it.   I've 
provided below a map for the points, please note this is the WEST desk, not 
the east, but please use it to determine which path has already been 
established.  


Best regards, 
BNG

I have requested a new one of these from the web site as I noticed that the 
conversion from DEC to $.  The book admin will get it to me as soon as they 
can.
