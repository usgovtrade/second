The good:

- The view from up here is fantastic and with a super clear view!

- The food was good

- The staff were super nice and helpful

- The price is so low you should be really happy

- The hotel was clean

- The facilities were nice and spacious

- The bathrooms were really clean and looked really nice

- The bed was clean and very comfortable

- WiFi was strong

- I think it was really nice that you got free towels

- It’s so close to downtown!!! I’m from Toronto so close to the downtown area is usually really good for me.

The bad:

- No one can reach me at any time and they only had one phone in the room which made it hard to reach anyone when I needed to. It was also really hard to get hold of my roommate when we needed to because they never answered the phone. In my opinion they have a way of fixing this though. They had to at least answer the phone when someone actually called because our call didn’t go through. Also if we could see a way of having a second phone it would make it easier to communicate.

- The A/C in our room didn’t work which meant that it got really cold at night and extremely hot in the summer.

- The lighting in the halls was pretty bad too but I don’t know how much it effected the customers of the hotel because I didn’t see anyone complaining about it.

- The air in the room got really hot and I really couldn’t sleep on hot nights because my bed was really hard and felt like it was going to break from the heat.

- Our bathroom was a bit messy because when we were there they had a lot of builders so a lot of dirt got everywhere. The carpet was also really dirty because of the dust.

- We were really surprised by the lack of towels. They told us there was a charge but it should have been a bit cheaper.

- Our room wasn’t always cleaned very well. We were there two days before closing time so we had to check out at 9 but the room wasn’t cleaned. Instead they told us to go and ask for a new room and clean it. We had to do that 3 times in the night.

- When we first got to the hotel there was a construction site at the entrance which wasn’t very nice.

- The wifi wasn’t very strong when we were there but after the first day it became really strong. The thing was that the room where we were got so many devices that the wifi speed dropped down significantly. They still had this problem when we checked out.

- We could hear the people that stayed in the room next to us talking from our room all the time but it wasn’t too loud. It just got annoying after a while.

- One of our last nights we slept from 10:30 to 7:30 and I got sick of the noise of the people next to us. If they had a time frame of when people were allowed to talk it would have been a lot better.

- It was really cold and noisy in the bar at night but we were there for work so I understand why there was so many people in there.

- They didn’t have the number to call the front desk when we needed it and sometimes the front desk didn’t call back until the next day when we were already out looking for it.

- The wifi speed in the hotel was really really bad and I got the worst wifi I’ve ever gotten in Toronto. It was so slow that you could only send emails really fast or else the wifi would crash.

- They didn’t have a big selection of movies or tv shows to watch on the tv

- We found this out a bit late so we couldn’t really do anything about it but our card machines didn’t work when we went to the restaurant. They gave us a new machine but after using it we discovered that it didn’t work either. I went back to their front desk after seeing the guy working behind it and he asked me what I wanted to do about it. I told him to just charge my credit card again and he got really mad at me when I said that. We had to go back and get the card myself and we had to get someone to help us.

- A lot of people in the room next door had smoking addictions which made it smell like an ashtray all the time and made it hard to sleep. I guess you could smoke outside?

- You didn’t get breakfast

- We found out this when we were there and it’s not their fault but they charge you $9.50 a night and there’s no breakfast or anything in return which isn’t fair because when you’re paying so much for a place to stay you expect to have a bit of a bit for breakfast. Also if you wanted to get breakfast you have to go down all the way to the back of the hotel.

- They didn’t have any rooms that actually opened to the right side but we got a room that actually opened to the right which was really nice.

- The toilet was dirty when we were there. It was really dusty and had flies in it.

- We found this out when we were there and we should have seen it but they gave us an extra key when we got there so the people next door could clean it for us when they were finished working. We decided not to tell them so it was just that dirty.

- They had a weird room phone number which was really hard to remember. Sometimes you could call the same room two or three times before you got a hold of them.

- I noticed the staff weren’t very nice and I was really surprised when they asked us to pay for the cleaning fee. I would have normally said that they didn’t clean anything but there was dirt on the toilet and in the bathroom and they even used our towels without asking us. I don’t understand how they can do that when they’re charging you for it.

- I would have liked to stay longer than 3 nights if it wasn’t so expensive. When you’re there for a week it was really expensive. It’s very inconvenient to pay so much.

- They put a big sign on the back of the door saying “Dinner 6:30 PM” when in reality we never got anything until 1-2 AM.

- When we checked in and told the person at the front desk that we wanted to have dinner at 6:30 they gave us a room number but when we got there the room wasn’t ready.

- We were checking in late and they only had 5 rooms for us to check in. It wasn’t fair that they only had 5 rooms because that’s not a lot and the other rooms weren’t really ready so they were really slow to give them to us.

- There was a very big group of backpackers and they only had two security guards to control them and they weren’t very good at it. One guy from the group stole stuff in the room and a fight happened with one of the security guards. The backpackers were all drunk and the security guard was drunk too so things went really badly for us that night. It would have been nice if they would have had more security guards though. They didn’t do anything when the fight happened.

- At 8 we had to pay them again for the room because they hadn’t cleaned it before we left the next morning.

- There was a very big party going on in the hotel one day that lasted all night and really messed up the whole night. The music was blaring all night and we had to ask the police for help to call them and ask them to control the party. When they came they just talked to us really badly and told us that they didn’t want to come back anymore because of all of the noise and problems they had with the hotel before they went there. They even gave us their number for complaints because they were so angry. I would have really liked to be able to ask the hotel for more security to control the situation better.

- It got cold at night and no one did anything about it which made it harder to sleep because it was so cold. They told us it wasn’t their problem and they were just a 3 star hotel but it’s pretty stupid to do that in a city where it gets really cold in the winter.

- When we got to the room they had given us and checked it out they had left all of the keys to the bathroom in the room so we couldn’t go in there for a really long time. We had to go to reception and ask them for more keys which was really annoying because it took forever.

- The rooms were really noisy, especially in the room next door and in the hall where it was very dark so we had to go to reception and ask them to turn on the lights. We had to keep asking because the reception</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:44
