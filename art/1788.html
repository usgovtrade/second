"Hey, hey." "If I'm gonna be a mountain goat, it's gonna be with a goat." "Come on, baby." " Come to Papa." " No, no, no." " Come on." " Baby, baby, baby." "Come on." " Come on." "Come on." " There's not a mountain goat in there, pal." "You got your fingers trapped, baby." "Let's..." "We'll go back to the three kind mountain goats in there." "A little help here." "Get me up to speed here, boys." "What's the deal?" "She seems really open to it." "Oh, yeah." "She's really out." "He did it!" "He broke her arm!" "Goat does not break woman's arm!" "Mountain goats do not break woman's arm!" "He's out!" "Let go of him!" "Put him down!" "Goat!" " Goat!" " Easy, son." "Now, now." "We still gotta find a way to get her back to civilization." " We don't have much time." " It's still light." "Excuse me." "Oh, you've gotta be kidding me." "Don't worry, he'll never make it." "Oh, yeah?" "Well, we'll see about that." "He's got a little bit of gas left." "It's dark now." "Go get her, but be careful." "I'm more worried about the bear than I am about her right now." "They say the fastest way back to civilization is through a minefield." "If only we could avoid all the land mines and just reach the shore." "I can't believe how many there are." "Just try not to step on any." "Don't worry." "I'll step on them and they'll be mine." "Go go go!" "That was close." "Here." "You're okay." "There's a boat." "Goat broke through it." "It's back on land." "We need to get to the water." "Let's go." "Good luck to us all." "And so, the men had to trek through the desert... and through the woods to make it to the ocean." "It was there they reached the point of no return." "They had to leave the woman... the camp and their supplies and go to sea... and that was when fate had something else in mind." "One, two, three, four, five, six... seven, eight, nine, 10, 11." "That's a 12." "One, two, three... four, five, six..." "Seven, eight, nine." "One, two, three... four... five, six..." "You know, these things are pretty tricky." "I don't understand why there's two instead of three." "I don't have a clue." " You're coming with me." " You're going with me." "Oh, sure, it's the easy way out." "Good luck to us all." "I didn't ask for a volunteer here." "She's a little thing and she can't even swim." "She's in my way, guys." "Just let me do what I can and I'll swim with you... just like this." " No, no." " Don't do it, you don't wanna swim." "Let's go." "Wait." "Wait." "Don't we need to throw him in too?" "Well, no." "If we're going, let's go." "Don't you see we're all going?" "The girl can't swim." " We have to make it look like she can't swim?" " Yeah, so that they don't drown her." "Are you insane?" "She's gonna drown." "Listen, we have to swim." "No, this is crazy." " She can't swim." " This is what happens!" " What's going on?" " There's been an accident." "She's drowning!" " What are you talking about?" " Yeah, she is." "She's drowning!" "We've got to save her!" " Don't do this." "You've got to!" " Get out of the way, kid!" " No, listen!" " You can't do this to me!" "Get back!" "You can't!" "What's happening?" "Why is he doing that?" "They're killing me." " They're killing me!" " No!" "It's okay!" "Don't you see?" "It's okay!" "It's okay!" "It's over now." "I'm not going back." "I'm not going back there." "I'm not going back." "I'm sorry." "Take me." "Please, take me." "Take me." "Take me." "Take me." "Take me!" "I know, I know." "She didn't have a name." "No, we don't know her name." "The boat is here." "We're getting out of here soon, right?" "We'll get off and go." "We'll get off in a..." "in a boat." "I'm sorry." "What?" "I don't know." "I thought you were someone else." "Someone else?" "I was asleep and I had this dream that I was in this office... and a voice came into my head." "A voice?" "What did the voice say?" "I can't tell you." "It wasn't clear." "You should go back to the village." "I'll be fine." "No, you should go." " Why would I go?" " You should go back to the village." "I'm not going." "You need help, my friend." "It's from the village." "Maybe they know how to save him." "I've decided to stay with you." "We're getting out of here now." "No, you should go back." "I'll be fine." "Don't move." "Don't move." "If you do, I'll break your arm." "We'll get him out of there." "Let's go!" "You will eat now." "You don't have much of a choice." "I don't have much of a choice either." "What do you want?" "I want you to eat and then I'll tell you." "Now you will eat." "Please, just let me go." "Let me go and I'll forget about this, okay?" "Eat, now." "Okay?" "Please just let me go." "You know you have to eat now." "Don't worry." "I won't make you eat." "As you wish." "Oh, my God." "What's going on?" "What's going on?" "Don't do it." "Please, don't do it." "You're gonna break your promise." "I said I would forget, but you won't stop." "I'm sorry." "I'm sorry." "I didn't know it would be like this." "You're right." "You're right." "I'm sorry." "I'm not gonna kill you." "What are you gonna do to me?" "Well, we're gonna save him, but first we have to get out of here." "We have to take him out of here, and then we can take him to the hospital." "I think there's a boat here." "That's why I went out into the water." "You were dazed and confused." "You were hurt and you couldn't remember anything." "That boat could have saved you." "Now it could save him." "Don't be afraid." "They're not gonna hurt you." "That's how we'll get him out of here." "I can get you to the shore." "And then when you're safe you can come back and rescue your friend." " What?" " Trust me." "You can do it." "I see a way out." "There's no way we're getting out of here now." "We have to." "Are you sure this will work?" "We'll find out." "If you want your friend to live, you have to do exactly as I say." "Okay?" "Is he ready?" "He'll be fine." "You can leave him now." "Leave him and let's go." "We can't take the chance." "He has to understand we need him, but we can't risk it." "He'll be fine." "Listen, he's gonna be okay." "He'll be fine." "Let's go." "Well done, my friend." "You did it." "Thank you." "Thank you." "I'm sorry." "Here." "You did it." "Let's go." "You okay?" "That was great." "Let's go." "No more games." "No more games." "You really love this game, don't you?" "You think they're gonna rescue us?" "No one's coming for us." "That's just our fate." "But we can help you get back to the shore." "What will we do there?" "Well, you'll have to keep yourself safe until the end of the day." "And then maybe they'll be back for us." "And then maybe we'll have a chance, okay?" "What do you do here for living?" "I collect shells." "Oh, shells." "I see." " Do you ever get lonely?" " I like to be</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:31
