You know what, I'll just let my hands float around on their own. 
I am here. My hands are here, that means... That means that I am not here. 
You know what. A simple "d-d-d" like this 
d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d 
it looks like someone who's lying down... 
So you don't do that. You just have to keep staring at the camera.
I will put my face right on the camera. 
I'm the only one here. So don't turn around.
I think I look like an idiot doing this. 
Okay? You understand what I mean. 
I hope you can understand what I mean. 
So please don't worry about looking stupid. 
Here. 
Come here.
Did I get it right?
If not, we should try again. 
Hey, keep staring at the camera.
It's like when I blink...
Please keep staring at the camera. 
I'll never learn 
I am looking at the clock too much. 
I didn't get it right. I tried again. 
No, keep staring at the camera. 
Did it look more natural this time? 
Was it better this time?
Then you're not doing it right. 
Please, 
Please, that's all. 
We can just pretend that we never saw that. 
I don't know where you were looking. 
But you were staring at the camera.
I can't do it. 
You look like you're doing it right. 
You...
Sorry about doing this.
Yeah. 
You see? 
You can try doing it again. 
It was better this time. 
The first time I didn't get it right. 
I don't know where you were looking. 
But you were like "I'm doing this."
Yeah.
I want to put my hand up.
So don't keep blinking for a very long time. 
Keep blinking naturally. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Thank you very much. 
You... 
Okay. 
Here, let me go back to the spot that we were in. 
Let's begin again. 
Okay.
Okay. 
Again, don't do that. 
Just keep staring at the camera.
Okay. 
Look this way. Look straight at the camera. 
Not like that. Just like that. 
Like "I'm doing this."
See? Now you can try it. 
Okay?
Okay. 
You can put your hands up. 
So you don't look like you're dancing. 
How do I do that? 
Okay? 
Okay. 
Start with a big "d-d-d" 
Like this. 
I was just dancing. 
Do it naturally. Okay?
Okay? 
Okay?
See? You don't have to push out your chest. 
What am I doing? 
The way you looked like you were dancing.
Okay. 
Okay. 
See? 
Here. 
Try it with your right hand. 
Okay?
Okay. 
How do you pronounce this?
What? 
How do you pronounce this? 
You don't pronounce it right? 
But, you have to. 
But you don't have to pronounce it right. 
But... 
Just...
You don't need to pronounce it that way. 
But it's important. You have to. 
It's important. Just tell me what to do. 
I can't. 
That's why... 
It's your job to explain things to me. 
If I don't know what to do, you have to explain it to me. 
But I know what you're doing. I've been doing this too long. 
You don't understand. 
So just tell me what to do. 
I will do that. 
But this is not going to work. 
It's like you're doing your face. 
But you don't have to do that. 
It's okay. I understand what you're saying. 
I'll do that. But I want you to do that. 
Do that. 
I'll do it. 
It's not like you're doing a face, you're just 
doing your hands, so just go ahead. 
It's okay. You're on camera right now.
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah. 
So that was the dance. 
I'll do that again for you. 
You're not doing it right. 
Okay?
Okay. 
Okay?
I'm trying to do it naturally, like you 
didn't do your face. 
Okay? 
All right. Let's keep going. 
No, stop. 
It's like this. It's like you're doing 
a very simple arm. 
So you look like... 
We don't really have to do this. 
Just look straight at me. Just keep looking at me.
I know that.
Don't do this.
You can put your hands at your side. 
Okay? 
Just... 
Look, you just look like... Just...
Okay?
Okay? 
All right. 
You can put your hands at your sides. 
That's the way you're going to look like. 
Okay?
Okay.
So... 
Okay? 
All right. 
Put your hands here. 
But don't do that. Okay?
Do it the way I showed you. 
Do it your way. 
That's it.
Okay? 
Okay. 
Okay? 
Okay?
Okay. 
Okay. 
So, that's all.
No.
Just keep staring at the camera.
Okay.
Don't look this way. 
Don't look like you're putting your hand here. 
So I don't look like I'm doing that, 
putting my hand here. 
Okay?
Okay.
Okay?
You're doing this, 
and then... 
I know, I know. 
I'll do my hand like this. 
That's it. 
I know you know. 
I know you do. 
No, that's it. 
That's enough. 
But keep your eyes like this. 
Okay? 
Okay? 
That's it. 
Keep your hands at your sides. 
Don't look like that. 
Look right into the camera. 
You know what you're doing? 
Just look at the camera. 
Don't do anything. 
What? 
Okay? 
Yeah. 
You look like someone who's lying down. 
Okay? 
You're good. 
There we go. 
That's it. 
Just relax and look at me. 
See? 
Look at me. 
I'll do the work. 
You don't have to do it. 
You are doing it all by yourself. 
That's fine. 
I'm not here. 
You are here. 
Okay. 
How do I look like this? 
Okay? 
Okay. 
Okay. 
So that's all.
All right. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Okay?
No, it's okay. 
Okay. 
All right.
Okay. 
Okay.
Let's move on. 
No, you can do this. 
So, I'll be over here. 
So, the one who's holding a camera is there. 
But the other one's at the back. 
Okay? 
You can just do it without me. 
So when you do your dance, 
just go ahead and do it here. 
I know. 
Okay?
You have to do it like that. 
Okay? 
Okay. 
Okay? 
Okay? 
Don't look like you're doing a dance. 
So I don't look like this. 
Okay? 
So, if you're going to do your dance here, 
then just look right here. 
So don't look</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:10
