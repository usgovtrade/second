of the friendly wave, they received an eerie look. 
So our final group has to be the 'Oh-S--t' eyes. 
They're those eyes you get from a car wreck that didn't happen 
on camera. They're the eyes you get 
from seeing a dead body that you can't look away from. 
And if someone looks at you with those eyes, 
you're pretty sure you're the center of attention, 
and this one was on full display in the video 
"Kick Kick Crazy Kids." This one's name 
in Chinese is actually 
'Wen Ru Shen' or 'Wise Man' eyes. 
A 'Wen Ru Shen' is a very clever person. 
He would like to help you, he just needs you to think 
before you ask for help.  
Well, that's all you can do today. 
That's our time. Thank you very much. 
Hope you enjoy the video.
You take care!
We are now in the second part. 
When some 'Wen Ru Shen' eyes approach us, 
we just need to think twice 
and see whether it's still good or not.
What you need to do is to quickly tell us whether 
the things they tell you are just jokes or not. 
Here we have a 'Wen Ru Shen' who says, "Go."
Well, he says it's a joke.  
I'm not sure. 
He adds the punch line which is a joke.
'Wen Ru Shen' said, "Go."
Actually, he really does want to help you. 
He just needs you to understand what he wants to say.
'Wen Ru Shen' said, "Go."
Let's go home now.  
Well, that's it. 
Let's go home now.
Well, that's it.  
Well, that's it.  
Well, that's it.
Let's go home now.  
Well, that's it.  
You just need to go home safely.
'Wen Ru Shen' said, "Go."
You don't need to be afraid.
'Wen Ru Shen' said, "Go."
You don't need to be afraid.
Let's go home.
Well, that's it.  
Well, that's it.  
We all had to go home safely.
"Oh, no, not the dog," he said.
"Go."
"Oh, no, not the dog," he said.
Well, he's telling you the truth, 
but he just adds a punch line, which makes it a joke. 
Well, "Not the dog" means "Be careful."
Well, actually, this dog might be dangerous, 
but he is not going to attack. 
He's friendly, but he's scary.
Well, it's true. We do not want to be run over. 
That's why, while you're walking, 
be aware that people, in fact, might go out of the way to run over dogs.
A dog might bark at you if you wear white 
to scare people who approach you. 
White is a symbol of death. 
We have to be careful and we have to be alert. 
That's why we've got to beware of people's intentions. 
Those are our final comments. 
Thank you for watching our video. 
We have enjoyed all of you and hope you enjoy your day. 
You take care, bye. 
Thank you for watching our video, bye.
