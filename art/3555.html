Hi there, I am so grateful to the Lord that he had me do this tour at the time of my life I was about to retire. It has a lot to do with the fact I was born and raised in Italy, so I understand what these families go through. Being born and raised in the Catholic Church we get this message loud and clear... and then for it to become a reality as an adult, to be blessed as it did for me and the families on this tour made me feel so close to God. When we go to the Catholic Church, we get more than a Sunday Mass and get to walk away with this gift. Catholicism offers every aspect of your life and will bless you more than you could ever imagine. I hope you all will take it as an encouragement. Thanks... read moreFri, 18 Jan 2013 17:59:25 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451117http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/18/in-a-day-catholic-school-students-walk-in-to-mosque/feed/110BOBBINGTONEverything in us is moving…http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/everything-in-us-is-moving/
The Lord is at work in a particular church. It is not just a human being, there is an angel in it because that spirit of the Lord is there. I was blessed to be able to go to one on January 11. The members are at work on how to get even more people to attend church in this area, this is part of their strategy. This place is a blessing to be in, there is a fire in the eyes of the members… these are people... read moreWed, 17 Jan 2013 20:45:01 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451065http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/everything-in-us-is-moving/feed/110BOBBINGTONThe Lord blesses us to share the good newshttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/the-lord-blesses-us-to-share-the-good-news/
This is my story. My brother Bob, on the phone with his wife Ann, just shared the good news that this church in this small community in the hills of West Tennessee had become a blessing to them with all the things that the Lord is doing there. It was a joy for them to share that and in that sharing I heard the passion in their words as they spoke of God... read moreWed, 17 Jan 2013 19:15:13 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451057http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/the-lord-blesses-us-to-share-the-good-news/feed/110BOBBINGTONA God that sees is a God that careshttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/a-god-that-sees-is-a-god-that-cares/
For me, and for all who know me, my wife and I are blessed to be in a blessed position. For the past five years we have been blessed to walk with so many. Some who can give so much of themselves and so many are just ordinary people. No matter where we have been or where we go the Lord has been blessing us. The Lord does not... read moreWed, 17 Jan 2013 18:03:15 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451036http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/a-god-that-sees-is-a-god-that-cares/feed/110BOBBINGTONThe Lord blesses us to be a blessinghttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/the-lord-blesses-us-to-be-a-blessing/
God’s calling on the lives of people is to bless us… and we get the blessing and we are always blessed as a result. Some people get caught up in God’s call to come alongside of them. When we come alongside someone, who has been called by God, he goes further in his calling in his ministry and we find that there are a great deal more people involved in his ministry, especially the members of his family. God always wants us... read moreWed, 17 Jan 2013 17:21:43 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451027http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/the-lord-blesses-us-to-be-a-blessing/feed/110BOBBINGTONGrowing up in and around the lakehttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/growing-up-in-and-around-the-lake/
I used to love it when our family would be home and one of our favorite times would be taking the boat around the lake. It’s a great blessing when you can enjoy the boat around the lake, especially in a place where you are going from place to place, such as when we are out in our cabin at Lake Lure. We have had so much fun on our trip... read moreWed, 17 Jan 2013 13:59:05 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451025http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/growing-up-in-and-around-the-lake/feed/110BOBBINGTONWe live a blessed lifehttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/we-live-a-blessed-life/
My wife and I thank God every day, our children, our grandchildren, our family, the Lord and others that we have been given this blessing. As we approach this year, the time in which we have a year’s notice of the next call from the Lord, our number one concern is that our focus on God should be better than ever. We see many who... read moreWed, 17 Jan 2013 13:09:11 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451024http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/we-live-a-blessed-life/feed/110BOBBINGTONGod’s call is to bless, to bless others, and to be blessed ourselveshttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/gods-call-is-to-bless-to-bless-others-and-to-be-blessed-ourselves/
God blessed me to have a lot of people around me who love Jesus. It’s not always easy to find people in my life who love Jesus and are filled with the Holy Spirit but God’s calling on my life has always been to not be ashamed of the Gospel and find people who have a similar lifestyle. The people that I have a relationship with... read moreWed, 17 Jan 2013 12:50:49 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451024http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/gods-call-is-to-bless-to-bless-others-and-to-be-blessed-ourselves/feed/110BOBBINGTONBlessing after blessing after blessing.http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/blessing-after-blessing-after-blessing/
I think God’s call on my life was always to use whatever gifts he has given me. He has given me gifts and talents, many of which are gifts from God to bless others. It’s easy to focus on blessings that are given to you and your family and others in your life. God always puts us in the... read moreWed, 17 Jan 2013 12:44:39 GMThttp://bingobobbingtonpost.com/commentrss.aspx?PostID=21451024http://bingobobbingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/blessing-after-blessing-after-blessing/feed/110BOBBINGTONThe Lord blessed me in many wayshttp://bingob</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:30
