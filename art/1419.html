"We have never had an incident involving police officers who refused to go and assist the ambulance. In fact, we have had a great working relationship," he said.

"The Police Commissioner told me the police would continue to help us to provide emergency assistance for our vulnerable patients."

In addition, Dr Grant said the majority of the people at risk of domestic violence were not being served by the GP-Plus clinics.

Ms Langley said in her speech that most people with serious mental illness were treated in public hospital emergency departments.

"About 50,000 of us end up in A&E over two years. That is half of the country's GPs. It is around 100 visits to the emergency department per GP per year," she said.

She also claimed people with serious mental health issues were being denied treatment as emergency doctors needed more time with them.

"They're [the health board] can't give it because the health board also has to look after people with a broken toe, a broken arm and someone with a chest infection."

Catherine Anne Kelly, chief executive of the Galway branch of the IHPA, which represents almost 100 GPs in Galway, rejected suggestions that people were being refused help in the area.

Ms Kelly said none of the six GPs would provide any comment at this time.

In response, the Galway branch of the IHPA said they supported any new services provided in Galway.

"However, there have been no major developments in the last number of weeks and in that time we have not seen any GPs from Galway West or Galway North West involved in discussions about this matter in the Galway area," Ms Kelly said.

"As we await developments we wish to put on record that we believe there are sufficient community health services in Galway and there are no plans for any cuts to these services."

Meanwhile, there are concerns in Galway that health board officials are threatening to withdraw funding from GPs without consulting the public.

Briefing documents relating to GPs and health boards in Galway were obtained by local councillors.

They said that a public meeting in Salthill will be held on Tuesday night on the subject of plans for changes in the medical system in Galway.

"It has emerged from the meeting that Galway West GPs are concerned that they are having a meeting with the Health Service Executive tomorrow in Salthill. This meeting has not been publicised and as far as they are aware it is being held behind closed doors," the document says.

"The Galway West GP group have concerns that they may not be able to communicate the outcomes of this meeting to their local public and as a result they fear it will put public confidence in the service at risk."

The document says GP participants at the Galway meeting were told that a meeting will be held in Galway on Wednesday.

This, it said, was so that the outcome of the Salthill meeting could be shared and communicated.

The health board in Galway has provided an update to the media following receipt of documents relating to GP surgeries across Galway.

The HSE says it is trying to find out why the documents were leaked.

It has denied claims that GPs are being threatened or asked not to speak to the media.

In a statement, it said: "HSE Galway is committed to ensuring patients in Galway receive excellent, safe and compassionate healthcare and that their health service is delivered in the most efficient and effective way."

- Minister for Health Dr James Reilly has asked the Oireachtas Committee on Health to examine plans by the HSE Galway to open a Mental Health Unit in Salthill, and a GP Plus Health Service in Galway city.

"At this stage, while a public debate and input are important, it is more important that health services meet the needs of people across Galway who need them.

"As we have said previously, we will take a proportionate approach to delivering a GP Plus model of care for the city. This will be agreed upon between the HSE Galway and the GP groups concerned."

Independent TDs and Senators from Fianna Fail, Fine Gael, Labour, the Greens and the Social Democrats said they were also concerned by the documents.

They claimed there was "an open door approach to the closure of community health centres, GP centres, etc. and a huge emphasis on putting these services into 'one-stop' shops" and that this "would be putting patients' lives at risk".

They called for "full and immediate disclosure" on the plans for a GP Plus.

"We urge the management board and the management at Galway Health Service to immediately consult with the GP groups involved to inform them on the status of plans for Galway North West and Galway West," the committee said.

The Health Service Executive confirmed that a meeting involving GP surgeries in Galway will be held this Wednesday.

It said in a statement that a full public consultation and a public meeting was not possible due to the "sensitive nature of these plans".

Galway County Council has refused to back the plans but it is also holding a meeting tonight in Salthill.

Meanwhile, it said it was a "foolish waste of precious health service resources to provide for 'one-stop-shop' centres.

"Healthcare is a community health activity and as such is best provided by local health services based on strong GP partnerships," it said.

The Health Service Executive stressed the plans would be "tailored to the local needs of the area".

The plans, however, appear to have generated the ire of the IHPA.

They said they are angry with the HSE for issuing a series of "misleading and very negative briefings and background to several issues associated with GPs in Galway" and that there was a breakdown in open</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:55
