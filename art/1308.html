Surprise and
what should happen to them?

In a room, it’s a girl who was hiding behind a door, ready to
leave the room and pretend to be someone else. And in the other room,
a guy was sitting, doing what it seems was just for fun. Then the
girl saw him, came closer and saw the gun. She turned pale,
and screamed.

Then the guy pointed the gun to her direction and began
blaming her for his lost job, not even knowing the role he played in
it. He was blaming her for his wife not getting good money, for his
wife’s depression, and that he hated it because she’d made
him do all this. And as he’d begun yelling, he got even more
worried and had gotten upset with her so much that his gun went off.
And shot her. And because of that the girl died.

A week after the funeral, the husband was found dead too.

The crime scene experts examined the scene to confirm their
suspicions, and they confirmed that the guy, who was a hitman, was
the killer. How? Well, the gun. But in the other hand, there was a
second woman who was shot dead in the hospital. She had a heart
disease, and had just gotten it diagnosed. But the doctors had told
her that there was nothing to do. And as the day had passed, she
decided to die and escape her illness, and her fate. And she made a
last wish before she died, which was to come to the room where her
husband, who was once a hitman, now died. And the last person she
would have expected was her husband.

She saw him sitting, looking down, and with a smile on his
face. He looked so happy, like she was still alive, but as she tried
to reach him, he looked up at her, saw the gun he kept hidden, and
he turned around, and aimed the gun in the right direction and shot
her. And he died.

In a room, there was a boy who had just found his mom dying.
But before the doctor gave her the last injection, the mother had
told her son to shoot her. In her last breath, she’d said,
“shoot me.” The doctors believed that this would cure her
illness. And the boy, who hated his mother, agreed with her. He
heard her final wish, and as he looked at her dying lips, saw the
gun he kept hidden behind his back, aimed it at her mouth and shot.
He didn’t know whether he hit or not, but as he leaned over his
mother’s deathbed, he closed her eyes with tears, wished she
was still alive. And she was. And his mum had just given him an
extra month to make a wish. And he wished for the same disease to
kill him.

How? As it turned out, he’d been taking his mother’s
medicine which made him feel like he was burning up. And since he
had no other symptoms of that illness, and no friends to check for
him, he was just left with his mum’s medicine as all he had to
escape the disease. But he was in a hurry. And so he had asked the
doctor to fast-track his medicine which needed to be taken at
specific times and not a day later. But the doctor couldn’t
forget it, and so, he decided to do it himself, since he wasn’t
going to waste any time, and just asked him to take it an hour later
as he felt he needed some. The boy then got what he wanted –
the medicine and the time.

A man who was dying from a heart attack was in a hospital. The
lady doctor who was doing the treatments was a bit scared about him.
Since she knew he was a man who only loved fast cars, he had never
liked medicines, so whenever he got such medicines, he would go
through violent and crazy rants, which were dangerous for the
doctors, since his heart wasn’t in that condition. So she
tried to help him. She gave him a few medicines in smaller doses,
and tried to calm him down, but he just didn’t like that. And
eventually, he threw her on the wall and ran away. As she went out
to look for him, she saw that there was something really shocking.
It was his car, in which he was dead. His heart had given in, and
his car had been in need of a mechanic, so he was waiting for a
mechanic to come so that he could give him a heart attack, so he
would die.

The guy, who was the man who’d given the gun to the hitman
was a nurse. He was told that he had lost his job. He didn’t
like it, but he tried to be happy. And he decided to move to a
different city to live and start working on something else. And he
went far away. And once there, he found a new job at a hospital. He
knew no one in the city, so he decided to go out for a walk. And he
met an old lady with a bag on his hand, who asked him to give it to
her sister, who was going to the hospital. And she went with him,
and gave him his new job. And he began the next day. And he was
really happy for the first time, and was making plans to himself.

A man and his wife were in a room, and the man looked like he
had taken the world’s second strongest acid trip. He couldn’t
see properly, and he had seen a ghost too. He was really afraid, and
was talking to the ghost too, since he was also afraid of ghosts.
And they were both running through the house, looking for the
closet. They found the closet, and saw a baby there. They tried to
climb over the closet and get to the baby. And then the man noticed
that his wife was gone. The man was horrified, and was asking the
ghost where his wife was, who was just a bit further up from them.
The ghost had then answered that the wife was standing right behind
the husband, and then he gave a smile. And he turned into a monster,
and killed his wife. And then, he started strangling the ghost.

A man had just got a new partner, who was just like him. And
so, they decided to buy a new house. But one day, they went to a
car show. And after that, they went to a drive-in movie theater. And
as the one week had passed, they decided to have an overnight
marriage in the park. And there they were, being so romantic, like
they were real lovers. And then, the guy ran up to the other guy’s
car and checked his stuff, and he saw that the other guy’s car
was missing one thing – its license plate. And he was missing
his. So they started looking for each other in the park, and it was
a long time they were looking for each other. Until they saw a car
wash, and thought they could meet there, and then they decided to
get married in their new car wash.

The guy’s eyes started looking like they were looking
through a tunnel. And he asked the doctor if he had any headache.
And he said he did, so the doctor gave him some medicine. The man
was not happy, but he took it. He was afraid, since he knew that he
was going to die from a heart attack, and he tried to ask for some
time to enjoy his wife. And the doctor was just trying to help him.
And he told him that he should go home, that his wife wasn’t
leaving him that easy. And he gave him some more time. But since he
was dying, and was afraid of dying, he ran away, and ran through the
park.

And then, there was a group of people, and they were all
telling their tales to their kids. And they were all talking about
their stories and how to make their sons fall in love with them.
Each one of them was planning how to make their kids fall in love
with them and fall into their trap. So, each one of them was trying
to make the other person fall in love with them, so that they can
get married. And they were all smiling. And then there was one guy
who was going crazy thinking about the first guy he had made fall in
love with him, and then suddenly, a woman appeared, and told them
that she didn’t have the money they had asked her for. So
they had started teasing her. And they didn’t let her get
through their trap. And they teased her and started getting close to
her, and she was so scared that she ran away from them.

A man, who didn’t know the ways of love, met a woman who
was his enemy. And he saw that she loved herself too much, and that
she was so lonely. And then he thought she would</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:45
