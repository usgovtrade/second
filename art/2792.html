Who did I tell where I was headed? Can you please do me a favor, turn around and drive back to where you found me."

"Well, I was about to stop and see if you were okay. I'm sorry I don't have a pen on me and will just have to drive back over there."

"Don't be silly, there is no need. I'm sure you don't need to go out of your way because I couldn't have gotten very far."

After checking my surroundings and noting where I had seen the green pick-up truck, I got in the truck and returned back to town. To my surprise, the truck wasn't there. Neither was the man. After a thorough search, I came to the conclusion the man had returned to his truck and taken off. I did a lot of thinking after that; most likely due to my hunger. I know now that they must have thought I was passed out. When you walk around as if you are drunk, your movements are erratic, and your body is bent forward, you have to deal with the fact someone may think you are on drugs. I couldn't really blame them. I wasn't doing anything wrong, but I was in a strange place in a strange town. I hadn't been back long enough to make friends, and I certainly wasn't dressed for this sort of a day. I was also very hungry. Once I would have been very scared, but having been on the road for a couple months now, I knew I would make it through.

I had to find some place to get a sandwich and then decide what to do next. I realized that I hadn't planned on walking all the way back to Pendleton, so that was out. Maybe that had been a bit hasty thinking I would be able to make it that far. I would just have to be more cautious. I still had a couple of weeks before I was going to have to go home and the summer was still young. Well, I thought with a wry smile, there is no chance of a summer romance in this town and I have no cash. What was I thinking?

The next day, I found an all night diner and went in, but it was closed. This little town was going to be an obstacle, and soon. After driving around for about a half hour, I came upon a little place that had just recently opened. I decided to check it out. It was called "The Mule and Hootch." I thought it sounded more promising and so I pulled into the parking lot.

On entering the joint, it was nothing to indicate I had arrived at a hippy hangout. The owner, or owner and cook, who was sitting at the bar, gave me a sly glance and winked. He appeared to be a little grizzled looking. I couldn't be sure, but he looked to be over thirty, maybe forty. I just smiled at him and nodded. "Yes?" I said.

"Yes what?" He said

"Yes?" I repeated, puzzled by his response and then added, "Can I get a beer?"

"Sure, be right back," He said and disappeared. I thought this was a bit odd, but I just sat there and waited. I heard the front door open and saw him reappear with another man. The man had dark brown hair, a mustache, and wearing a cowboy hat. I saw the looks that the two of them exchanged. I got a bad feeling in my gut.

As they were sitting at the bar, I saw them say something and the man at the end of the bar, reached for what looked like a pistol in the holster tied to his leg. His gun was pointed at the other man. My thoughts went to an old Western movie I had seen and suddenly realized I was in one of them. The other man gave the owner a questioning look and it was his turn to pull out his gun and point it at the other. I was about to stand up and tell them to forget this, when I heard the owner say, "Oh no, this is not how it works, son."

The man lowered his gun and then said, "Sorry, Jack, thought you was one of them nigger dudes from down by the highway. I thought you was looking for some moonshine."

"Well, you see," said Jack. "Me and Jim here don't care much for folks who come in here and just assume we're going to go for a ride."

"Yup," replied Jim, "I don't like them none either. Can't trust folks that just walk in here without saying a word."

Jack smiled at me and asked, "Why don't you tell me what brought you here. I am pretty sure I can help you find a place to stay."

"Yeah," said Jim, "I don't know nothing about her, but you can tell he wants to do some moonshining."

"I'll do you a deal," said Jack. "You stay out of my business, and I won't tell your dad you bought moonshine from some giddy up in here and made your mouth dry. And you," he said turning to me, "if you see him, you'll get something that will make your throat bleed and he won't be able to drink anything for two weeks. How's that?"

"That sounds fair enough," I agreed, taking a sip of my drink.

"What brings you here then, stranger?" asked Jack.

I was glad he did. I needed to think about what I would say. I decided to just start, "Well, I'm new here in Blue Summit. I didn't think anyone lived in this town. Well, until now."

"Is that right? You just thought that out of the blue?" Jack asked.

"Not really," I said. "I stopped at this truck stop south of town, and found the place pretty empty. I'm just here until I get back to my truck, which is about a mile or so from here. Then, I'll turn around and leave."

"Well, I see you are a good girl after all." Jack said.

"Hey, watch it there," warned Jim. "I just like my teeth and I don't want them messed with."

Jack leaned close to me and whispered, "Jim here believes you are a little bit of a witch, or something. He thinks you cast a spell on the guys at the truck stop. I guess you could say he is my witch buddy and he is sure there is something not right about you."

I nodded.

"A witch? Here in Blue Summit?" I asked.

"It was the truck driver's truck that was at that truck stop. He told Jim and me about it. From the description of a blue pickup with a green box on the side, we knew it was yours. Then I looked at this picture of you." He showed me the picture of me on his desk. "Yeah, that's you all right, but it was taken over thirty years ago, so I'm pretty sure we could get back together some day."

"You still ain't said what you are doing here," Jim said getting back to the subject.

"Oh yeah," Jack said quickly, "I work in the mines down south of here. I just saw you walking down the street and had to say hello."

"It has been a couple months since I have seen another human being," I said. "It felt good to just walk down the street and not have people think I was drunk."

"No one has to think you're drunk in here," said Jack, "but everyone likes a drink. I don't think you should drink all the time, but I would hate to see you just go home every day."

"And how do you know I don't go home?" I asked.

"Well, because we don't. You look like you aren't quite ready for a regular bar. You look like you are headed somewhere or are keeping an appointment or something. I am just trying to keep an eye on you, that's all. I have a girl in here that tells me everything that happens in town. So I keep an eye on you, but I am not nosy. I don't mean to pry into your business."

I smiled. "Jim is a pretty good witch, but I think you have the idea. He can really get into places and can see things others don't. His eyesight is pretty good too." I smiled. "Oh, and he and I are friends of a sort."

Jack glanced at me and then asked, "You two close?"

"Well, not really," I said. "We would get along well if we had the opportunity. We come from the same kind of background. We just haven't had the chance to get to know each other as well as I know him."

Jack put his elbows on the bar and ran his fingers through his hair. I could see him trying to decide something. He was looking me over. "Well, I might know of a place where you could work. They do need someone around this part of the country. If you are interested, I could talk to the boss."

"I would be interested in that," I said. "You have that way of seeing things that doesn't fit in this town. You see the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:40
