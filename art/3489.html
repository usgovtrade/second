The exhibition match between Ryugo, a current top star, and Oshima, who will be the first foreigner to wrestle as a maegashira in Japan, will be the main attraction.

“I want to participate in the exhibition matches because I want to show my pride in sumo at Yokkaichi-Takamatsu (Yokkaichi City), which is the only city in Japan that has a long history of sumo.
