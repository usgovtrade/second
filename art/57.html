Chapter  1.  Once  upon  a  Time,  The  Land  of  Noh... Part  I

Once  upon  a  Time,  the  Land  of  Noh...

The  Land of Noh...

When  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of Noh  was but a  young  child, his family  was already  an important  political  clan.   The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh's  family  had  always  held  a  firm  and  loyal  stance against the rule of the  other powerful clans in the land, so much so, that  the  other clans felt  threatened  and  feared  the  young  lord of the land  of Noh.   The  young  lord  of  the  land  of Noh  was the  eldest  son of his family,  he was a bright, energetic and determined man. The  young  lord of the land  of Noh  possessed great power,  but  also  great intelligence.  The  young  lord  of the  land  of  Noh  studied his subjects and studied his  neighbors.   Many  of his subjects  knew that he  studied and studied well, and the  other clans were not very surprised when he  began  practicing  the  forbidden  martial  arts.

To  protect  the  land  of  Noh,  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of Noh  trained his  subjects  to  practice  certain  martial  arts  which  he  invented.   He  invented  many  secret  martial  arts  which  could  only be  taught  to  the  chosen  pupils. The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  taught  the  people  these  arts  as  the  land  of  Noh  was  about  to  be  invaded  by  a  great  military  force.

During  his  studies,  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  invented  and  practiced  secret  martial  arts.  When  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  completed his studies  in  the  martial  arts, he went  into hiding for a while and trained  his body and mind  in his  secret martial arts.  He  also  studied and  trained  several  of his martial  arts.  It  was  said  by  many  of his subjects  that  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  was  invincible.

When  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  was  about  to  go  into  hiding  again, he  decided  to  travel  to  the  other  clan  that  was  invading  his  land.   The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  had  never  defeated  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  during  his  studies  in  martial  arts, and  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  was  determined  to  change  his  fate.   He  had  to  defeat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  first.  The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  traveled  to  the  other  clan  which  was  invading  his  land, and  his  family  left  the  land  of  Noh  to  meet  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  there.

On  his  journey,  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  met  with  a  young  traveler  who was also on a journey  to  meet  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh.   This  traveler  happened  to  be  his  uncle, a relative  from  his  mother's  side  of  the  family.   The  young  traveler  was  surprised  when  he  saw  that  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  was  a  child.  He  was  happy  that  he  was  a  relative  of  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh.   But  the  young  traveler  was  not  happy  that  his  relative  happened  to  be  a  child.   The  young  traveler  would  never  let  this  young  child  know that  his  uncle  was  a  relative  of  his  mother's  side  of  the  family.   They  talked  and  traveled  together  through  the  land  of  Noh.   In  the  land  of  Noh,  the  young  traveler  was  happy  to  talk  to  a  friendly  neighbor.  The  young  traveler  talked  to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  about  how  he  planned  to  defeat  the  invading  clan.   The  young  traveler  explained  to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  the  strategy  and  the  strategy  worked.   The  young  traveler  explained to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  about  the  other  clans.   The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  learned  about  the  invaders  strategy  and  about  the  other  clans.  The  young  traveler  told  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  that  he  had  taught  him  a  secret  martial  art  which  was  unknown  to  his  uncle.  He  also  gave  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  some  special  gifts.  The  young  traveler  said  that  these  were  gifts  from  his  mother's  side  of  the  family,  but  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  did  not  believe  him.

The  young  traveler  revealed to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  that  this  was  a  gift  from  his  uncle, and that the young  traveler  was  his  uncle. The  young  traveler  used  some  of  the  special  gifts  and  some  of  the  skills  he  had  taught  to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh.   The  young  traveler  also  used  some  of  his  skills  to  get  close  to  the  enemy  camp.   He  knew  that  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  was  invincible.   The  young  traveler  told  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  that  he  has  some  of  the  skills  he  taught  to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  and  he  wanted  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  to  show  him  the  forbidden  art  he  learned  from  his  uncle.   The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  agreed  to  reveal  the  forbidden  martial  art  to  the  young  traveler.   The  young  traveler  explained  to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  the  forbidden  martial  art  and  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  believed him.  The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  was  impressed  by  the  young  traveler's  knowledge. The  young  traveler  asked  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  about  the  reason  for  the  conflict  between  the  two  clans  and  if  he  can  defeat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  first.   The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  said that he did not know why there was such a conflict between the two clans.   The  young  traveler  got  close  to  the  enemy  camp  to  observe  the  attacking  methods of  the  leader of the  invading  clan.  He  was  a  very  good  observer  and he knew  that  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  could  not  defeat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  if  the  attacking  force  consisted  of  only  himself.   He  was  glad  to  know  that  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  used  one  special  technique  to  defeat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  in  his  lifetime.   He  also  asked the  young  traveler  if  he  knew  what  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  did  and  what  he  did  after  he  defeated  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan.   The  young  traveler  answered  that  he  did  not  know.

The  young  traveler  used  one  of  the  gifts  and  the  skills  he  taught  to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  and  defeated  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  with  his  special  technique.  He  was  happy  that  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  got  defeated.   The  young  traveler  then  showed  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  the  special  technique. The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  learned  the  special  technique  and  the  young  traveler  realized that  he  taught  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  a  secret  martial  art.  The  young  traveler  explained  to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  that  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  would  become  a  great  martial  artist,  but  the  young  traveler  was  sad  that  he  did  not  teach  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  this  secret  martial  art  before.

The  young  traveler  asked  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  to  become  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  and  that  he  should  become  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan.   The  young  traveler  asked  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  to  train  and  lead  an  army  of  his  friends, relatives and  people  from  his  mother's  side  of  the  family  to  defeat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan.   The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  thought  this  plan  could  not  work.  He  had  never  trained  with  other  people  before  and  it  was  impossible  for  him  to  train  other  people  and  lead  an  army.   The  young  traveler  had  expected  that  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  would  say  that  this  could  not  work, and that he  could  not  do  it.  The  young  traveler  gave  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  a  special  gift  and  told  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  that  he  would  teach  him  this  secret  martial  art  himself.   The  young  traveler  said  that  this  would  not  be  possible.   The  young  traveler  said that the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  must  defeat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  and  that  he  would  teach  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  how  to  defeat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan.   He  gave  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  a  special  gift.  The  young  traveler  explained to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  the  secret  martial  art  that  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  would  learn  from  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan.   The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  understood  what  was  going  on  and  thought  that  this  would  work. The  young  traveler  gave  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  another  special  gift  and  told  him  that  this  plan  will  work.  The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  was  a  very  good  fighter.  The  young  traveler  said to  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  that  this  will  be  difficult. The  young  traveler  took  his  hand  and  said, "I  have  given  you  a  special  gift, now you  have  to  teach  me  this  martial  art, you  are  my  teacher,  you  have  to  beat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan.   Now  let's  go." The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  took  the  young  traveler's  hand  and  said, "I  do  not  want  to  do  this, I  want  to  work  as  a  farmer. But I  have  to  become  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan."

The  young  traveler  said, "The  most  important  thing  is  to  make  the  other  person  think  that  you  have  given  them  a  gift, even if  the  other  person  is  aware  that  they  have  been  tricked. That's  why  you  have  to  think  about  what  the  other  person  wants  to  do.   They  do  not  know  that  this  will  not  work.   They  think  that  this  will  work  if  they  work  together  with  you." The  young  traveler  walked  away  and  said  that  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  will  do  this  task  for  him. The  young  traveler  left  Noh.

After a while the young lord of the land of Noh died. His last words were "I am going to defeat the leader of the invading clan, I want to learn the secret martial art from him.  The young traveler left and the young lord of the land of Noh died."

The young lord of the land of Noh  
The  young  traveler  took  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  into  the  mountains.  He  gave  him  another  special  gift  and  told  him  that  he  would  make  the  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  defeat  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan  and  become  the  leader  of  the  invading  clan.  The  young  lord  of  the  land  of  Noh  was  a  very  good  fighter.   He  understood  what  was  going  on  and  thought  that  this  will  work. The  young  traveler  took  his  hand  and  said, "The  most  important  thing  is  to  make  the  other  person  think  that  you  have  given  them  a  gift, even if  the  other  person  is  aware  that  they  have  been  tricked. That's  why  you  have  to  think  about  what  the  other  person  wants  to  do.   They  do  not know  that  this  will  not  work. They </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:03
