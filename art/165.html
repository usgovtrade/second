currently planning on taking another guy's kids,"

"I don't know what you are talking about," the other blonde 
responded, also sounding slightly annoyed, as the 
older woman smiled at me with understanding and went back to her 
seat.

"You really should." I laughed. "Or you'll wind up like Mimi 
and that won't be so hot," I added with a glance at the woman I 
thought of as Nana the Nagger.

"Well, I guess I'll just go see if I can get laid," she huffed.

I laughed again and leaned back to watch the rest of the 
show, my laughter a reminder to myself that the humor around 
today's problems and disappointments would always be easy.

I was always right.

I got a text message from the office. "Ping-pong tonight at 
eight."

My friends had moved to town several months earlier and 
immediately discovered my love for the new competitive game 
that came from the combination of the ping-pong table and a 
martini. I had just received a new ping-pong table for my 
birthday and decided it was time to put it to good use.

The two women walked in about ten minutes after I did. I 
looked up with a smile and waved. "Hey guys. Come join us."

I was happy to see that, as was usual for the girls, one was 
dressed like a slut and one was not. I thought the slut look 
was the far more effective one for a woman.  And after a 
hard day, who could resist a woman willing to be that 
sluttish for you?

"This is my friend Jenny. She's from New Jersey," I told 
them.

"Hi," she replied, with a warm smile that revealed nice teeth.

"Cool," they both said, like they knew how to get it.

"Are you kidding me?" I said. "I think you'd have to be an 
Idaho fan to like this one."

"I'm sorry, but your jersey is not something to be proud of," 
the former cheerleader said to me.

"It's actually quite pretty. I could put it in the 
kitchen."

"It's a disgrace to sports," the other chimed in.

"Can we agree to disagree, since I happen to like it?" I 
asked.

"Are you kidding? It's the ugliest jersey in the history of 
sports," the slut proclaimed.

"No, it isn't," I argued. "There is actually a cute little 
fox or raccoon on the front," I said, looking from one of 
them to the other, trying to gauge their reaction.

"A fox?" they both said, sounding incredulous.

"You think that's bad? Some of the people who designed 
jerseys in the early 1900s were clearly out of their minds, 
since they put a fox on the front of the shirt of the 
Washington football team," I said.

"Now wait a minute," the slut said, seeming irritated at the 
whole conversation. "I was the one who invited you over. I 
should get to pick the movie. I get what I want. And I want 
this." She pulled out a huge bag of red licorice from the 
cupboard. "I'm going to enjoy every inch of your body. Right 
now."

Her friend nodded in agreement, as the first blonde stripped 
to her underwear.

"Okay," she said. "I won't have sex with you."

She threw herself on the couch and began munching on the red 
licorice, just like I told her to do.

"Wow," I said. "That was incredibly impressive. How did you 
find such a great friend?"

"She saved me from joining a cult on Craigslist," I was 
told.

"What cult?" I asked.

"It's called the Church of Scientology. The friend I found 
says it's all a big rip-off. Apparently they force you to 
throw away all of your electronics and eat nothing but 
brown rice and wheat grass and sit with your butt on fire for 
hours."

"I'm sorry," I told her. "I'm not laughing at you. I'm 
laughing at that cult," I explained, taking a look at the 
red licorice.

"Why am I not surprised," the blond with the big rack said 
to me.

"She's been in here eating red licorice since we moved in," 
the friend added.

I looked to the friend who had not stripped down. She had 
long, straight blonde hair and was sporting an outfit more 
attractive than anything I owned. She also did not have red 
licorice in her hand.

"Can I get you anything?" she asked me, smiling. "And by 
anything I mean a date."

She had a beautiful smile and the same energy as the former 
cheerleader. If she was on the front of the basketball team 
instead of her friend, she would be the most sought-after 
girl in the school. She was very thin, which wasn't common 
in the world of basketball coaches.

"Oh God," I thought. "I am still not over this girl."

The next two weeks flew by. I was working every night, so 
I'd arrive home around midnight. I didn't mind so much, since 
Tiffany was usually home at that time. Her roommate, who 
also had her own place, was only home in the mornings.

This put her in the position of having to be as discreet as 
possible about her lesbianism. She tried hard, but after two 
weeks of working together every day, she was beginning to 
show through. In fact, the more I saw her without her clothes 
on, the more I wanted her.

"I really don't want to say anything about what happened 
between you and Jenny yesterday," she told me one morning.

"You don't? But you know. Why not?"

"Because. You don't need to know," she said.

"Why?" I asked.

"I just don't want anyone to know about it."

"But you can't keep that to yourself. You're too loud. If 
you don't tell everyone, then people will start to talk about 
you. It's not that I don't want you to date other people, but 
you're kind of a big deal here and no one wants to see you 
hurt."

I could hear myself whining and I knew I had a problem. 
"I'm sorry," I said, placing my hands on her shoulders. "I'm 
sorry I'm such a child about this. It's a lot more serious 
than I'm making it out to be. I want you so much and you're 
so beautiful."

"I'm pretty, but I really am scared," she admitted. "It's 
good that you understand."

I couldn't understand. The same person who was asexual in 
college was now completely opposite the next day. I was 
embarrassed for her. It's hard for me to say, but she was 
being a prude.

We had a long talk, where she told me that she didn't want 
to date anyone else, but I felt that she didn't respect me 
enough to not have sex with me. We talked a bit about mutual 
respect, but I couldn't really put my finger on the exact 
issue, since she was pretty much in a relationship with her 
panties at all times.

My friend called the next day and, even though I had told 
him not to, he called me on my cell phone. "I just wanted to 
tell you that you're a dirty, dirty boy," he said.

"I thought I already was," I joked.

"You have no idea," he said, without laughing. "Now that I 
think about it, I've gotten some flack because I'm a 
Christian."

"A Christian? Why is that a problem?"

"Well, you know. It's just different. People expect you to 
be homophobic. All the lesbians look at me like I'm an 
underwear model. It's not as if they would want to try and 
talk to me about Christ or anything," he said.

"People expect you to be homophobic?" I asked. "What kind 
of people would expect that?"

"Well, the people who are Christians are</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:12
