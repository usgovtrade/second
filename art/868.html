I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things."

Chris was the first to see the police.  He said, "Here come the 
fucking cops."  

They came over to our tents to investigate.  The first thing the 
police saw were our tents set up in a circle.  We had no permission 
to be camping out.

We were ordered to break up the party and put out the fires, which 
were in pits, not trash cans.  The cops then took us to the park 
police station.  They told us we had to get out of there and bring 
everything back to the school.  They were going to cite the students 
who set up the fires, and they confiscated our alcohol.

Some of the more experienced hikers came to the rescue and told the 
city police that we were only putting up tents and were not breaking 
any laws.  The police asked us if we had a permit to stay there. We 
told them we were a bunch of college students having a reunion. We 
asked if we could go back to class and asked to see a supervisor. The 
cops told us the Supervisor would be out in the morning. The cops 
drove us to the park. We were stuck at the entrance with a sign that 
said "Warning: No Trespassing." The cops went into the park and left 
us there, and by now the media had shown up.

The next morning some of the park police came to pick up their 
eviction notice. They also called the local police and asked them to 
send a police car to the park at seven the next morning. 
By 10:30 the next morning there was a lot of news coverage about the 
police raid on the park. Everyone from park rangers to reporters to 
tourists were staking out the police line and watching our every move. 
We had a lot of press following us into the park. All of the media 
said we should be arrested for camping without a permit.

That evening we moved across the park to a large patch of grass. 
As evening came in, we had another police raid with some flashlights 
and bullhorns to tell us to get out of the park. We got everyone 
back to the school except the Vietnam vet, who was in custody. We 
gave up for the night because the Vietnam vet was on his way to 
jail.

The morning of the second day of our blockade, there were two more 
police raids. Then one of the park rangers stopped by to check our 
permit. He saw that we had a bunch of dogs in the park and wrote us 
up for a violation. The second time we were given tickets and told 
to leave the park. Our permit was under the name of a student who 
graduated two years before we arrived at the school. So we tried to 
put up a sign to notify the park authorities, but the cops were there 
so fast that they tore it down. They didn't want the media to hear 
that we were camping in the park without a permit. We ended up having 
to go back to class.

At four PM that afternoon, we learned that the park ranger was not 
going to try to enforce the ticket that we were given for having 
dogs in the park. 
The next morning we realized we were going to be arrested when we 
saw about 50 police and park rangers standing on the other side of 
the school with about 20 patrol wagons lined up in the parking lot. 
The cops read our summonses out loud and put our fingerprints on the 
back of the summons. The cop read out our charges: "Trespassing on 
private property, disturbing the peace, and failure to leave." 
They then took us into the woods to a patch of forest near the 
school. About two weeks later we got summonses for all of us that 
said, "Contributing to the delinquency of minors." It said, "The 
juvenile court ordered that because these persons are in your charge, 
you are responsible for them." 
We were in the forest for about an hour. We kept sitting down and 
getting up because we knew we were going to jail. All of the press 
had arrived to cover the police bust. Our tickets said we were all 
being charged with "contributing to the delinquency of minors." We 
were each charged $1,000 for the minor crime of "contributing to 
the delinquency of minors." The park rangers came and got us out of 
the forest.

We knew the park police were on the warpath and that our tickets 
weren't going to go away. The only solution we saw was to escape 
the park by going to the forest. We decided to call a press conference 
and tell the press that we were leaving the camp. This press conference 
would take place in a patch of forest near the camp. The police got 
an injunction against us from a court of judges at the school. The 
injunction said that we were banned from all the woods, and we were 
told that we were not allowed to speak to the press. 
The school sent two of their security guards to help us cut down 
the tent. They said that they would take it to the dump themselves. 
They didn't want to leave it at the school with all the reporters. 
There were about 20 cops at the park, and our security guards looked 
frightened. The cops told them not to worry about us, and that we 
would be back at school. They also told them not to worry about us 
breaking into the school to get to the food, and that we would bring 
food back for the troops. The guards seemed relieved to see us leave 
the park.

As we were walking to the forest the reporters went nuts. We had 
not been warned to ignore the press. We just felt it best to ignore 
them. As we were walking into the woods, they started calling out 
questions. One of them asked how we could trespass on private property 
since we had permission from the school. I told him I was in the 
woods without permission, but that the school knew where we were. 
He said he didn't understand. I told him that the school even knew 
when we were leaving the woods. The cops just rolled their eyes and 
walked away.

We decided to leave a pile of food and other items on the sidewalk 
to show that we weren't afraid of the press. 
It was already nine PM at night. We had a bonfire at the picnic area 
and started taking down the fence that surrounded the park. We 
had an anti-aircraft machine gun in a tree. We loaded the gun and 
were sitting around the fire. The police told us we could only have 
the fire on the north end of the park. We sat down and tried to eat 
as we burned up the barbed wire. We put the fence back up after we 
finished the fence. The fire looked like it would keep the cops away 
from us.

Just after the police were done with us, there was a police car 
in the woods and they began to break down a part of the fence. 
We had to burn the fence again and put it back up again. We did not 
make a big show of doing this, but the cops knew we were going to do 
it.

One of the first things we did after the fence incident was to light 
up a fire and make a lot of noise. We had a picnic at the playground 
with the food. It was about a block away from the police line. We 
were in the park, and it was well after midnight. The police came 
and took us into the woods. We sat down with our backs against a tree 
and we ate and watched a small fire. A big police car drove up to 
the edge of the woods, with three officers. They just watched the 
smoke and the small fire. We also had two anti-aircraft machine guns 
in the woods. This time they didn't notice them. When we finished, 
we told the cops we were hungry and cold, and that we were hungry 
to go to sleep. The cops told us that we had to go back to the camp 
without sleeping, or we would be arrested.

The next day some of the press finally noticed that we had escaped. 
They went and stood on the edge of the woods where we were. The 
police told us we had to stop making noise and that we were making 
a lot of smoke. We said that we were making the noise because we 
wanted to be heard, but that if they wanted us to stop making noise 
they should make more noise than us. So the cops told us that if we 
didn't shut up they would arrest us for disorderly conduct. We asked 
the police for a police car to follow us back into the woods. The 
cops told us they</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:08
