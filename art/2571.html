The New Age Astrology Oracle Cards are for anyone who’s interested in Astrology, Spiritual Psychology and Spells, Hexes and Curses.

A booklet has been written and compiled by Zoe de Waele giving detailed explanations of the meanings of the Zodiac Signs, the Ascendants, the Nodes and the Houses, providing a greater understanding of Astrology and its application for life.

The Zodiac cards show the Sun Signs. The Ascendant shows your personality, traits, attitudes and temperament. The Nodes indicate the areas of your life which may require extra attention, while the Houses represent your attitudes, personal needs and desires. By combining these factors you can form an idea of your strengths and weaknesses in areas of life such as health, relationship, work and environment. The Ascendant card is your personality as it shows how you perceive the world; the Ascendant also indicates how you treat others. You are born with your natal Ascendant, which represents your identity, basic nature and character. The Nodes are your key influences, aspects of your life that are important to you. The Nodes tend to influence a person through his desires, interests, relationships and health. Zoe has written a detailed explanation of how to understand these cards, which has not been done in any other book that I have seen. It is the information contained within this booklet that makes this course invaluable for any prospective Astrologer or who wants to learn more about Astrology in general and the Zodiac Signs in particular.
