The Horses are in the Manger

The Horses are in the Manger
Walking down the aisle in church and my heart is cold
Walking through the mud, my love on a hill
And all the horses are in the manger

One of them knows what I was thinking of
You know there's something happening to me.
She knows that I don't care what they're thinking of
I don't care what they're thinking of

Do You Wanna Funk?
Walking up and down your street, and I can't hide my pride,
My mind is reeling like a hurricane (I don't want you)
Your mind is reeling like a hurricane (You don't want me)
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to slow down
Wanna take you high, baby, wanna take you low (You don't want me)
You don't want me to stop, You don't want me to slow down
You just said that you wanted me
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to slow down
Wanna take you high, baby, wanna take you low (You don't want me)
You don't want me to stop, You don't want me to slow down
Wanna take you high, baby, wanna take you low (You don't want me)
You don't want me to stop, You don't want me to slow down
Wanna take you high, baby, wanna take you low (You don't want me)
You don't want me to stop, You don't want me to slow down
Wanna take you high, baby, wanna take you low (You don't want me)
You don't want me to stop, You don't want me to slow down
Wanna take you high, baby, wanna take you low (You don't want me)
You don't want me to stop, You don't want me to slow down
Wanna take you high, baby, wanna take you low (You don't want me)
You don't want me to stop, You don't want me to slow down
You just said that you wanted me.
