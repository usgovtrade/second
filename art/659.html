Xenosaga's Ending Makes Godzilla Cry

One of Xenosaga's most memorable endings occurs at the end of the final battle between Shion, KOS-MOS and Liquid Snake as seen in the OVA "Xenosaga I: Prototype", in which the true form of Godzilla appears on the battlefield. As the battle reaches its climax, Godzilla uses his Maser to destroy the entire fleet, save the flagship KOS-MOS which narrowly escapes from the blast. This scene was later replayed in the "Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse" anime series, but in the context of the new enemy invading the earth to begin their war against humanity. Godzilla is clearly distressed, almost crying, as the events unfolded before him, and it is implied that he believes KOS-MOS, a sentient, will suffer at the hands of humanity. For KOS-MOS and the people of her home planet Iscandar, the only option is to be exterminated, which to some degree would also be Godzilla's fate if the invasion were successful.

Xenosaga: Episode II's Story Does The Opposite Of Everything From Xenosaga: Episode I

Both the Xenosaga series follow a consistent pattern throughout their stories. The first game is a standard JRPG, which uses both traditional JRPG gameplay and standard RPG plot progression. Episode I has a few non-RPG mechanics, like the Time Compression System, the use of the XS engine, the Valkyrie system and the use of the U.M.N.S.

In contrast, Episode II is a third-person shooter in which almost all gameplay mechanics are centered around firearms. Episode II also employs a new gameplay system, called the "Hyper Dimension Neptunia System", and makes a lot of leaps in terms of gameplay compared to Episode I. Although the series is primarily a story driven RPG, Episode II's story had almost no connection to Episode I's story aside from some similarities in the cast, and many fans didn't even realize the two games were linked. Even though the two games are almost unrelated, it doesn't stop players from referring to Episode II as the 「Second part of the Xenosaga series」, which is very similar to the Japanese saying, 「一緒のは二度」 (Shitsugo ni wa futari), meaning a pair of siblings.

According to a writer for the Japanese magazine 週刊アスキー(weekly Askere), the developers didn't want to retell the same story again, and that they were influenced by the game Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne, which has a different setting and story from the previous SMT game, Nocturne, and both are set in different worlds.

Xenosaga: Episode II is a strange game that takes place in an alternate universe separate from Xenosaga: Episode I.

Xenosaga's Episode II has a reputation for being difficult, but what about the general difficulty of the series? As much as I'd like to, I can't compare the difficulty of Episode II with that of Episode I, because the only way to play Episode I is the Japanese version of the game, and the only way to play Episode II is the English version of the game. Episode I's difficulty is pretty forgiving, as Episode II is very unforgiving. I found that if the game was challenging and difficult, I wouldn't have been able to finish it. Episodes I and II have a lot of difficulty in terms of story, mechanics, gameplay, and progression. It has one of the highest difficulties of any Xenosaga games, and I have to admit that Episode II has the most difficult story of the series. The plot of Episode II was nearly impossible for the average person to understand at first, and they could even skip through portions of the game without losing or changing any of the plot. However, once players can keep up with the story, it becomes one of the most compelling stories to be told in the genre. The difference in difficulty can also be seen with the graphics. Episode I's graphics were average at best, and Episode II is extremely high quality. I believe that one of the reasons why Episode I was so hard was because of its graphics, and while the graphics in Episode I were horrible, Episode II was a big improvement over Episode I. Episode II's graphics were of a much higher quality than Episode I, and it was better to use 3D graphics to depict Godzilla. But even though Episode II has a lot of flaws, the most notable flaws were during gameplay, as Episode I has a much more accessible storyline.

On February 12th, 2012, Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse began its localization for the English-speaking market. Prior to the launch of Episode II, series director Tetsuya Takahashi, wrote the following tweet:

With Xenosaga Episode II, Tetsuya Takahashi didn't have much to say, but he still said a lot with the words "Xenosaga Episode II is the most difficult game in the series." That's all he wrote, and everything he wrote seems to have some weight behind it.

Xenosaga has a history of having very high scores on the console review websites, and the reasons why have to do with the technical side of the games as they are related to the hardware. I'm talking about the PS2 version of Xenosaga: Episode I, which was rated extremely high on the console review sites. Xenosaga is considered one of the most cinematic games on the PS2, and that's all because of its graphics and quality of motion. The game is also extremely short, and most of that has to do with its replay value. There are too many areas, characters, and plots to go through, and the game takes a very long time for the player to finish. The length of the game is one of the factors that could have caused a replay value boost. The replay value in Episode I is actually incredible, although it doesn't help a lot with the length of the game. The story is one of the hardest Xenosaga games in terms of difficulty, and that's because of the way the plot unfolds. Almost every aspect of the story changes a lot throughout the game, and because of the way the story unfolds, I can't help but wonder why the game's length is almost at an acceptable length.

According to a writer for the Japanese magazine 週刊アスキー(weekly Askere), the developers didn't want to retell the same story again, and that they were influenced by the game Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne, which has a different setting and story from the previous SMT game, Nocturne, and both are set in different worlds.

With Episode II, which will be released in Japan on April 24th, 2012, it will be interesting to see what kind of reception the game will receive upon its release in the western market.

Xenosaga has a very interesting story, and every time someone tells the story of Xenosaga, there are always two interesting bits of information to be revealed. If anything, it's the story that makes Xenosaga really interesting. Xenosaga is about the battle between the humans and the aliens (Xenos), and both humans and aliens are battling for mankind's soul, which is Godzilla. The aliens are trying to conquer the earth, but the game is really about the fight between Godzilla and Mardock (also known as The Galactic Federation), a mysterious race that wants to conquer all life, even Godzilla. The fact that the Galactic Federation in Episode I was revealed as Lucifer, the very same race that is trying to conquer the earth in the Bible, adds even more mystery to the story. All things considered, Godzilla is the best part of this game. Godzilla has become an icon of all monsters, especially kaiju in the entire Xenosaga series, because of his role as the champion of humans against the galactic Federation. Godzilla is the only thing that protects humans from the Galactic Federation and the aliens, but Godzilla has a dark and corrupted side that the aliens must conquer. There are many characters that give Godzilla a lot of personality, and they have a big role to play in the story, especially when Godzilla is battling against other monsters.

Xenosaga Episode II is one of those few game series that has a plot similar to what Japanese RPGs have. One example of another RPG that has a similar plot is the Soulcalibur series, especially the first Soulcalibur and Soulcalibur II. A particular thing that stands out with Soulcalibur is the main antagonist - Seong Mi-Na. In Episodes I and II, the main antagonist is KOS-MOS, and she plays a large role in the story.
