"You're telling me." "Fate is my homie." "I don't know if it's fate that I had sex with her." "What, her?" "I mean, she was so" " What was she wearing?" " I don't know." "But it was fate that I had sex with her, because my destiny was to finish high school and get out of Long Beach." "Yeah, when she walked in, I didn't even recognize her." "I wanted to have sex with her then and there." " What?" " I just wanted to have sex with her and be like" " You wanted to" " And I wanted to fuck her." "And now me and her are in love and I don't want to fuck her." "And I wish I could go back in time and just have sex with her again." "I love her." "I don't care if this hurts her." "Because if she can accept me for me, she's gonna accept me." "This is who I am." "I don't know, man." "It just doesn't feel good anymore, you know?" "I feel like the whole world is against me." " What the fuck?" " What do you got?" "You get this email?" "I got this email from Kristi's dad." "He wants $20,000, or else he's gonna call the cops on me." "Shit, man." " Yeah, that's him." " It's her father." "I'm really sorry, man." "I was really drunk." "I shouldn't have been in the position to take advantage of her like that." "I never thought she'd go through with it." "I just felt really pressured." "I'm really sorry, man." "I didn't mean for this to happen." "I really didn't." "Let's just try to figure out how we can get out of this situation." "This guy, he's pressuring me for money." "I don't know what to do, you know?" "No, he's got a gun to my head." "I got your email." "So you did get the email." "Thank you for replying." "Now, listen," "I'm going to get in touch with your friend now, okay?" "You tell that motherfucker if he doesn't give my daughter $20,000, I'm going to shoot up the whole fuckin' house." "That includes the dog." "You tell him that." "Okay." "Hey, you know what?" "I get it." "I'm really sorry." "Okay?" "I am really sorry." "I am really sorry." "Please don't do anything." "Please don't do anything." "You know what?" "I'm gonna do everything that I can, okay?" "I really am." "Thank you." "You know, I appreciate it." "I'm going to get this money somehow." "I promise you." "I don't have it now, but I'll get it." "Just please don't do anything." "You need to do everything that you can and so does she." "I really, I promise you." "So the money-- does he get it or not?" "No." "He calls the cops instead." "And they arrest him." "And I mean, I do whatever I can to make him feel as comfortable as possible." "In the end, I get thrown in jail for aiding and abetting a suicide attempt." "I did two years for something I didn't do." "When I get out, I lose my job, my apartment." "Apparently, I'm not allowed to leave the state because of my felony record." "I'm living with my mom in Washington." "Things are really bad for me now." "That's when I find out that Kristi has died." "And because of my felony record, I can't even get a job like at a car wash or something like that." "I can't even get a job at McDonald's or anything like that." "I can't get anything." "I'm really, really sorry." "I fucked up." "I know." "I'm sorry." "Everything just got fucked up." "I tried to help you." "I know." "I know." "I know you did." "Everything got fucked up." "It's all my fault." "No, it's not your fault, Dad." "It's not your fault, it's my fault." "I should have seen it coming." "I should have protected you." "I should have protected you." "I'm sorry, Dad." "I'm sorry." "You were just a kid." "You were just a kid." "I love you so much, Dad." "Don't cry, Dad." "I'm sorry." "I love you." "I'm sorry." "Sorry." "So now it's just my mom and I." "But my grandma, she died while I was in jail." "And apparently I'm too much of a screwup to take care of myself." "I know." "You know what's crazy, though?" "She didn't outlive my dad." "He died a year after I went to prison." "And here I am, 40 years later, raising a baby with the same felony record as I did when I was 18 years old." "Just the other day," "I was in the grocery store, and this old lady, she was like," ""Are you her grandma?"" "I was like, "What?"" "She's like, "Yeah, you look just like my grandma." "But you have the same felony record as my granddaughter."" "You just gotta pick up and start over, right?" "Yeah." "So..." "I mean, what-- how are you and Mom?" "You guys good?" "Um..." "Yeah." "Actually, no." "We're not." "We're really" "We're really bad." "We're fighting a lot." "It's" "It's pretty bad." "Like all the time." "Like constantly." "All the time." "But we've been trying to figure out a way to work it out." "And I have an idea." "I thought, you know, if we could just go somewhere for a weekend and" " And just try it out." " You know?" "See what it would be like." "And you guys could figure out if you like each other or not." "Yeah." "It's worth a try, right?" "I mean, you guys both deserve to be happy." "You know?" "Yeah." "Yeah, definitely." "Yeah." "I mean, if you think you can forgive each other." "Yeah." "Yeah." "I'm not sure I can." "Me neither." "But I think I can." "I don't know." "That was a lot." "You're gonna be okay." "I'm really proud of you." "I'm glad to see you, Mom." "Me too." "Me too, sweetie." "Okay, Mom?" "Okay." "Yeah." "Thanks for the ride." "You don't want to hug your mom?" "Okay." "No." "No?" "Okay." "No hug for you?" "Okay." "Okay." "Maybe just a little one?" "Okay." "No, we don't do that in America." "You know that." "Yeah, but we're international now." "Okay." "All right." "Hold on." "Hold on." " Okay." " Okay, I'm good." "I'm good." "I'm good." "So what are you doing in town?" "Well, my mom lives out here now." "She has for a while." "Where from?" "She's from Venezuela." "Yeah, Venezuela?" "I know." "She's" " You know, she met my dad here." "So..." "Cool." "Wow, so your mom's a Venezuelan Jew who met your dad in America, and now you're Venezuelan." "Yeah." "Yeah." " Wow, that's" " Yeah, you got it all going on." "Okay." "Yeah, I guess so." "Yeah." "Hey, is that your wife?" "Oh, no." "No, no, no." "She passed away." "Oh." "I'm sorry." "So I'm living with my mom now." "That's cool." "It's pretty cool." "Are you okay?" "I don't know." "I feel so bad for her, you know?" "Like, all the stress and anxiety that I put her through." "And I feel like I take advantage of her, you know?" "Like, we share a bathroom, but I still live in my own apartment." "What are you doing?" "Well, it's time to go to bed." "It's 8:30." "It is?" "Yeah." "Are you gonna be able to drive?" "Yeah, yeah." "I'm fine." "Are you gonna be okay?" "Yeah." "Okay." "All right." "Good night, sweetie." "Good night." "Bye, Mom." "I'll call you tomorrow." "All right." "Okay, good night." " Good night, guys." " Good night, my love." "I feel so bad for my mom." "I feel like she doesn't even get to see me most of the time because I'm so busy with school and work</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:12
