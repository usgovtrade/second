I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate

half.   We cannot keep playing politics at the expense of our customers 
interests and the legal system.

I think I would go the route of getting some kind of acknowledgement from 
Trout and/or Hayslett  and work with them to try to resolve the issue.  What 
are your thoughts?

Just in case you guys have not already done so, a copy of Steve Kirk's 
answer (on the RFP) to the TW motion to force Steve Harris to comply with the 
existing agreements is being faxed to each of you by messenger service 
tomorrow.  I think I told Chris that the next step was to get some 
consequence on Harris' side for non-compliance, and that's the end game.  
Please note that, if there are any other substantive positions that I may be 
unaware of, please let me know.  Thanks. DF

Drew, I believe we agreed that when we got the TW demand letter that we would 
not send any more until the PG&E filing.  You have received my thoughts on 
the demand letter.  Please take a look at the PG&E filing on the other side 
and give me your thoughts.  I know we have discussed this with Mike and Rod 
and are coming to agreement.  I believe we are going to wait for the FERC 
hearing, and let the PG&E filing take its course.

Steve

I assume we still want to push hard for a good case on TW.  I believe we 
need to get some sort of direction from Rod.  Please let me know if I'm 
overlooking something.  Thanks. DF
