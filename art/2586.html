"The FBI has never suggested that (Jones) was involved in any crime, including criminal activity while in office as a City Council member or while a federal elected official," the spokesman said.

The spokesman added, "The FBI has been actively involved in several ongoing investigations of the mayor's supporters involving drug trafficking, fraud, and racketeering."

Fleming also told reporters that two other former mayors, Jerry Meyer and Mark Mallory, were investigated by the FBI.

At least some of those investigations may be connected to an ongoing battle over a hotel in downtown Spokane owned by the city. And while details of the FBI activity remain sketchy, it does indicate the FBI's interest in Spokane was very intense and ongoing.

The mayor did not return calls seeking comment about the FBI investigations or the allegations made in the affidavit.

Fleming did not answer a question about whether the mayor was currently under investigation by the FBI or DEA.

"That's not a question I can answer at this point. Right now, my focus is on the city of Spokane and our work here," he said.

"However, there's nothing I can say about the FBI," Fleming added.

The alleged mayor was caught on wiretap in November 2013 in a drug deal with a man who was then an informant.

It was unclear from court documents who the mayor, the informant or the undercover informant were calling. The informant said the mayor "wants that (dope) and he’ll give you that for that," according to the search warrant affidavit.

The transaction took place at a house in Liberty Lake and was set up by the confidential informant. The unnamed mayor was also at the scene.

The affidavit does not make clear whether that house belonged to the mayor or the mayor was conducting business at someone else's residence.

The mayor, and another confidential informant who was at the scene, told the mayor, "Just hang tight, like I told you; I've been waiting on you. I just got a little weed," according to the search warrant affidavit.

The mayor then asked, "How much?" to which the informant answered, "$120 worth, so just give me a little bit for now because this ... was supposed to happen earlier. Now it's a little late."

That purchase occurred about a week before the mayor was at the scene of another drug deal between the confidential informant and an undercover agent.

On Dec. 20, 2013, the mayor and his attorney were at a coffee shop where the mayor was introduced to a cooperating confidential informant.

The mayor asked for $40 worth of cocaine. The undercover agent said, "I got to go get it, so I'm just gonna meet you there in a little bit," and agreed to meet the mayor and his attorney at a local restaurant.

The undercover agent met them at the restaurant and handed the mayor a clear bag with what appeared to be a small quantity of cocaine.

The mayor asked if the undercover agent had tested it. The agent replied, "No."

The mayor replied, "No problem," as he handed the agent an envelope, according to the affidavit.

The agent said the mayor should expect to receive about $6,000 for the cocaine. He said the undercover agent would then call him a few days later to set up another buy.

The meeting ended and the undercover agent gave the mayor $2,000 and arrested him.

The DEA said that investigation was separate from the investigation into "allegations of misconduct related to his participation in public office."

Fleming confirmed the mayor was being investigated but did not elaborate on the specifics of that investigation.

"We are very familiar with all aspects of this case," he said.

Fleming did not discuss the investigation into the mayor during Tuesday's interview, instead directing questions about other topics.

In 2015, while appearing as an expert witness on behalf of a businessman, Fleming said the mayor had personally recruited him to become an informant in Spokane's government, including by setting up a conference call with him, a law enforcement official and the mayor.

When questioned by the judge, Fleming clarified that the mayor had not "offered me any job or anything like that."

Fleming is currently suing Spokane law enforcement over a claim that city investigators tried to convince him to commit perjury in a civil trial over allegations of corruption.

He said he has spoken with law enforcement about the investigation. He is convinced it's not related to the ongoing court case.

Spokane City Councilman Breean Beggs also is under investigation by the FBI, according to a search warrant affidavit released by the agency this week.

Beggs allegedly met in Spokane with a person who was providing methamphetamine for Beggs in exchange for sex.

Beggs, who has not been charged with a crime, said he has been at odds with the FBI over that investigation for some time and has filed Freedom of Information Act requests to try to get more information about why the FBI is investigating him.

He and Fleming also have clashed over policy proposals to reform Spokane's campaign finance rules and to overhaul the way police and city officials are hired.

Fleming, who says he is not seeking re-election to a third term, had sought to keep details of the federal investigations out of the press.

His spokesman released a statement in which he accused Beggs of releasing the search warrant affidavit.

“The filing of such documents was a violation of grand jury secrecy,” the statement said. “Furthermore, they reveal no information about our pending investigation.”

Information included in search warrant affidavits is not protected by grand jury secrecy rules, according to the Washington State Attorney General’s Office.

Beggs argued that his release of the affidavit shows he is innocent. He has since made the affidavit public.

Beggs has declined to comment about the allegations against him.

"The documents are public, I have no comment," Beggs said Monday. "We don't know who the FBI is looking at. If they think they have an issue with me, they should talk to me."

The mayor will continue to be part of Spokane City Council business next year even if his term expires, but he will not seek re-election.

"Right now, there's nothing to talk about. We've got work to do in the city," he said.

The mayor's political career came to an abrupt end after multiple Spokane politicians, including police officers, had publicly speculated about whether or not they believed the mayor was involved in criminal activity.

Fleming said he will not speculate on why the FBI and DEA have focused on the mayor.

"The affidavit speaks for itself," he said.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:45
