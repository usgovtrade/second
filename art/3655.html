Livin' In The Past And Present (1979-80)
Livin' In The Past And Present was T.C. McMullen's first album of new material in six years. It is musically adventurous and has lyrics that deal with contemporary issues including AIDS and ecological issues such as global warming. Despite this, in live performances it often includes covers of songs by The Pretenders and The Rascals. The song "Black Men" is a sarcastic commentary on the concept of white guilt over the African-American civil rights movement, a subject that T.C. McMullen dealt with in the following year with his album The Last Supper, which is based on African-American folk ballads.

A follow-up to his album Livin' in the Past and Present, The Last Supper was T.C. McMullen's first album of original material in four years. The album was recorded with some of the same musicians who had worked with him in his previous bands, including Roger Lomas (vocals, drums) and Bob Watson (vocals, guitar).

Moon Landing (1982)
Moon Landing is T.C. McMullen's second album of original material to be released on vinyl. Like its predecessor, it was not a commercial success. In its place was a 12-inch single featuring one of the last recordings that he made before retiring in the early 1990s.

"Moon Landing" (McMullen) – 5:33
"The Greenhouse" (McMullen) – 4:07

 "I'll Still Be Blue" (McMullen) – 5:30
 "The Devil Thinks He's A Saint" (McMullen) – 5:12
 "Miles Away" (McMullen) – 2:52

"A Little Piece Of Happiness" is a minor hit in the Spanish language, and a dance club favorite, when an instrumental edit is used by DJs as background music for their events. McMullen also recorded an "easy listening version" for the German edition of his album which featured a new ending and some orchestral overdubbing, as well as some spoken parts by McMullen, including some more Shakespearean references. The single was also re-issued in a special limited edition with a 7-inch vinyl to promote the special edition; both "Moon Landing" and "A Little Piece Of Happiness" also appeared on this special edition.
