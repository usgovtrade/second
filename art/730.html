distribute our power.

The Wall Street Journal reported on May 30th that Enron,s Chief Executive 
Ken Lay persuaded a joint meeting of the company,s big lenders to forgive $1.2 
billion worth of debt, and is close to getting the rest to go along.  Ken Lay 
spoke to members of the bank syndicate that is financing the $3.5 billion 
Dabhol project.  According to the report, Lay stressed that it is in the 
investors, interest to complete the project.  He reportedly assured the 
lenders that there is plenty of liquidity to complete the project. 

We intend to use the project,s equity to establish our first line of 
defense.  Our first two lines of defense are the project equity and the 
cash flow hedge.  The original equity of $1.2 billion is now increased by the 
$1 billion from the initial loan to $1.3 billion.  However, if the project 
does not prove out as planned, it,s quite possible that the project equity 
will be worth zero, and the power project will be on its way to a troubled 
fate, very much like California,s long-term contracts with PG&E. 
If the banks accept Mr. Lay's arguments, this will be our first written 
confirmation that they think Enron can pull it off. If our assumptions prove 
to be correct, we will be able to protect ourselves in a manner that will 
result in a big gain for our investors. 

The second line of defense is that Dabhol will be used to hedge our exposure 
to the rupee and the INR interest rates. As an example, assume we have $1 
million in a bank account in India earning 3%. If we lock in the rate, it 
could give us another $.30. If we have Dabhol generating $50/mwh at an 
Exchange rate of 46.49, then 46.49 * 50 = $2350. If 46.49 * 46.36 = $22,400. 
Therefore $2350 * .3 = $700. The result of locking in Dabhol is an increase 
of $900, or $700 plus interest. 

Therefore Dabhol gives us 2 lines of defense, and we should make sure the 
lenders know we intend to use both. There is obviously no guarantee Dabhol 
will do the job, but it does give us a good negotiating position in Dabhol's 
favor.

We have always had a difficult time with foreign lenders, because they want 
more collateral for risk. If we can get more collateral for risk, then they 
will be more willing to negotiate a good deal. 

If we do use Enron Credit Inc. to provide a credit line on the project, then 
we have to consider whether we will need a full guarantee from Enron Corp. 
Inc. or if a partial guarantee will suffice. However, we need to make sure 
the lending bank is comfortable with the underlying assets in our portfolio. 
One way of doing this is to provide for an audit of our off-balance sheet 
subsidiaries, in a manner similar to what we did with respect to the LJM 
partnerships.


If we use outside counsel, it would be very useful for them to get up to 
speed on these issues. If we need to get outside counsel, then we should do 
so as soon as possible. We might consider using V&E to handle the equity 
participation and the related regulatory issues. 

Please let me know how you wish for me to proceed in these matters. I look 
forward to hearing from you.
