It is written like this because I made a typo in a previous comment. If I get any other posts with typo I will try to correct it by changing it in the previous post.

The question is not about the typo but the fact that it is written like that. Not only is it not a complete sentence, but there is also a complete sentence above it that cannot be read at all as it is part of the text written like that.

I believe the typo has been fixed so should be removed by now anyway.

A:

At the moment, the question is on the "first page" of the review queue; there are no "comments" on that question. As such, the comment thread has been left, in this case as an answer. You can flag that answer, requesting moderator attention (or leaving a comment on the meta post for the mods to see), as appropriate, if it needs to be removed.
Once a question reaches 10K and is no longer in the review queue, it can be deleted from history.

If we remove the "non-question" from the "question", it still doesn't make sense. The edit was:

Should I include this comment or should I removed it?

What the reviewer wants to know is, "should I leave the comment or remove it?" They're asking, in a rather roundabout way, about the question itself, not the answer. It can be parsed in a grammatically correct manner, but it still requires rephrasing.

A:

If someone has edited a question, it means that either he asked the question in a different way and wants to fix it, or he understood the question differently than you do. In any case, he has the final word on the matter. In particular, the author of the question gets the reputation for the answer, not you. You don't deserve any reputation from the post either way. You can delete the answer if you think it doesn't deserve an upvote, but you can't delete it because you think it's incorrect.
As for the typo, a moderator or 20k user has made the edit you're talking about, so you can ignore it. This edit was not really necessary, but that's what happens when you try to fix a typo when there are more than 10 answers on a page.
As for the "question" comment, you don't need to have much reputation in order to post it, but even if you have a low reputation you don't have any authority over the post. Moderators can remove comments that don't contribute to the post, but I doubt you need to. And they usually do when the comment doesn't actually contribute to the post.

A:

What you say is a bit overconfident.  
Whoever wrote this is a new user who appears to have a lower rep. (And, consequently, I do not think he/she knows how this works.) So, the user is trying to contribute to the forum in an appropriate manner.
So, I find it hard to believe this question should be flagged or simply ignored.
Moreover, as was pointed in one of the comments in the post mentioned by T.E.D., comments have very specific functions and they are not there to answer questions; they are to clarify, or, more frequently, to add some context. 
(Moreover, they are not meant for giving final answers. They are not like the "answers", they are more like the "comments" on the answers of a SE site. )

A:

For the title typo, I am assuming that the post is the question, and the typo was changed from

"Should I include this comment or should I removed it?"

to 

"Should I be included this comment or should I removed it?"

which are both grammatically correct, even though the former is not idiomatic, and might reflect a slight misunderstanding of what the editor is doing, but the latter definitely reflects a lack of familiarity with the English language in general.  Of course, you can't tell from the edit comment what the editor thought might be wrong about the post, and it is also possible that the original poster knew better than to ask in this manner, which might make the question better.  In any case, it is not appropriate to flag the post for deletion without the question author's permission.

For the comment beneath the post (or the first part of the question), I think the first part of the answer is correct. That's an example of what the editor is doing. That part of the comment is in a grey zone of sorts. 
It is a clear comment, but I don't think it is really adding anything to the quality of the post. The poster, if he were the only person who read the post, would know that their questions is very poorly worded. One possibility would be that there are several similar answers out there, and the questioner just copied someone else's answer, but didn't bother to edit it a bit more clearly. But the question is poorly phrased anyway, and is just missing an ell or a question mark somewhere. In any case, most answerers here would be too kind to mention this in a comment, which should ideally be flagged, even though the question may still be left for future readers.
