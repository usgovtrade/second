The United States of America is deeply divided. Since the election of Donald Trump, the racial animus and class division of our society have been inflamed. From Baltimore to Ferguson to our foreign entanglements, race and class seem to be America’s Achilles’ heel. With so much at stake, we have to know how to understand these fractures and stop letting them define us.

We need a new vision of race and class. We need to see ourselves as one united people with the ability to be strong together. We’ve got to believe in the American dream, but we can’t believe in it if we are keeping score.

In Hate Our Tribe, historian Heather Cox Richardson, co-director of the Center for Oral History at UCLA, tells us about the stories of three real people who fought through war, poverty, disease, class warfare, and prejudice to make a home, love, and care for their family. These are the families that survived hatred and segregation. They are a legacy of strength for the generations to come.
