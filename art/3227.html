In 2016, he provided the voice of Gaston in Beauty and the Beast and Nasty in the fifth season of Once Upon a Time.

He plays Hakim on Sosie in the first season. He played the antagonist, the "White Walker", in the eighth episode of the third season of Game of Thrones.

On May 13, 2019, it was announced that Koechner had joined the voice cast of the Netflix series Tuca & Bertie, voicing the titular characters' boss, as well as other unnamed characters.

Theatre

He starred in many Off-Broadway productions of plays such as Paddy Chayefsky's The Tenth Man. He portrayed the lead character in the 2000 play The Vagina Monologues at New York City's Orpheum Theatre and the 2001 national tour. Other Off-Broadway roles include Richard Zetcher's Black-Out Baby at Second Stage Theatre, and Michael Zastro's The Pitch at the Atlantic Theatre Company.

In 2003, he starred in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theater, directed by Michael Kahn. This was followed by a 2005 staging of Charles L. Mee's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the 2004–05 national tour of Sam Shepard's Buried Child and the 2003–04 national tour of The Rocky Horror Show.

In April 2007, he starred as Bob Avian in Harold Pinter's play Celebration at the Samuel Beckett Theatre in Dublin.

He starred in The Seagull, Off-Broadway in March 2009, and is still a member of the theatre company.

In October 2009 he took on the title role in "Vienna: The Improvised Musical", an improvised musical directed by David Ives, with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Ives. He has worked frequently with Ives, both in the short-lived musical adaptation of David Mamet's Oleanna and in the film version of The Dumb Waiter.

On April 4, 2010, he joined the cast of Rent.

In 2013 he portrayed Charles Ludlow in Arsenic and Old Lace at Theatre J in Sacramento.

From September 30 to October 9, 2013, Koechner portrayed the title character in Bertolt Brecht's adaptation of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

From September 20 to October 29, 2014, Koechner appeared in the title role of the Los Angeles premiere of Bertolt Brecht's The Threepenny Opera at the Theatre at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles.  The production was directed by Mark Brokaw with sets by Ricardo Perez-Vigil.

Koechner appeared as Mr. Pirelli in the Broadway revival of Sunday in the Park with George directed by Daniel Sullivan which opened in previews March 5, 2018 at the Shubert Theatre and officially on April 21, 2018. It closed on May 18, 2018 after 28 previews and 108 regular performances. The limited engagement production, which has a current national tour, has received much critical acclaim, particularly Koechner's performances.

Personal life

Koechner is openly gay and is one of the few major stars to have come out publicly before his mainstream career took off. In a 2000 episode of HBO's Real Sex, his character, Dick, is asked if he'd like to sleep with another man in a threesome. Dick replies, "I don't know, I'm kind of nervous about the whole thing." He subsequently adds, "It would be weird to be with two guys. I'm pretty sure it would be for them." In his stand-up act he has addressed homosexuality in such a way: "It's interesting to me that I can walk into a restaurant now and not be recognized. That is new. Not that I wanted to be recognized. It's interesting that it didn't used to be that way. It was more like 'Wow, look at that guy! He's got this hairstyle! Look at him! Look at that guy!'"

Despite being a regular guest on The Late Show with David Letterman, Letterman never directly addressed his sexual orientation, except for a joke on the October 28, 2012 episode where Koechner joked about being a "huge heterosexual". He appeared on the January 12, 2014 episode, where he asked Letterman if he could bring on his "boyfriend". Letterman replied "you and what army?"

Koechner's memoir Just Kidding: Bigger Fatter Liar (which he published himself through his website) was released in November 2010.

On June 15, 2017, Koechner received the Humanitarian Award from the Ali Forney Center, an LGBTQ youth shelter and resource center based in Harlem. In his acceptance speech, he was lauded by Human Rights Campaign president Alphonso David and honored by the presence of Human Rights Campaign president Alphonso David.
