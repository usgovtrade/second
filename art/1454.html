Stella’s Custom Room in Toy Box

If you have downloaded the latest Angry Birds Stella game update you will be able to access Stella’s toy box where you can create, save, and share your own designs! In the toy box you can create the dream bedroom of your dreams as well as get your very own bed and desk items, outfits, and even your own favorite Angry Birds.

New Egg Sack – “The Loyal Pig & Puffs Pet”

The latest Angry Birds Stella Toy Box update adds a fun new style of collecting eggs. Now you can collect new Eggs by feeding your friendly little pig, Puffs, the Stella Egg Sack. As you feed the pig they will keep giving you Eggs in order to become their ‘Loyal Pig & Puffs Pet’. This allows you to get Eggs by feeding the pig or through completing level challenges and adventures.

New Toxic Slime!

The new toy box update has added a new Angry Birds Stella slime! This toxic slime will kill any bird that touches it, so make sure you take care of it. To avoid the slime, you can simply make the slime disappear when you touch it. As always, no birds were harmed during the development of these updates.

New “Angry Pigeon” Character Sprites

In addition to Stella’s new toys, we have added a few other new items in the Angry Birds Stella update as well. In particular, you will find our newest Angry Pigeon character sprite sporting a new hat. We are very excited to have this brand new character join the flock!

New Outfits

A number of new outfit items were added to the toy box for you to decorate your Stella. And there’s also a new Angry Birds Stella costume to add to the wardrobe for your little one.

New Stella Toy Box Levels
