I'm a firm believer in getting as much out of each bite as possible. In this recipe, we do just that by combining mussels, sweet corn, and crab in a thick, buttery sauce. You can substitute chicken stock for the fish stock, if you like.

3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1½ cups)

3 garlic cloves, chopped

1½ cups fish stock, store-bought or homemade (see recipe)

2 ears corn, kernels removed from the cob, or 1 cup frozen corn, thawed (from 2½ to 3 ears)

One 12-ounce can evaporated low-fat milk

4 ounces crabmeat, picked over for cartilage and shell and flaked

3 dozen littleneck clams (about 1¼ pounds), scrubbed

2 dozen mussels (about ¾ pounds), scrubbed and debearded (see Note)

2 tablespoons tomato paste

3 tablespoons heavy cream

2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, plus extra for seasoning

2 teaspoons ground coriander

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems (from about ¼ bunch)

6 lemon wedges, for garnish

1. Heat a large, wide, heavy-bottomed pot, such as a cast-iron Dutch oven, over medium heat. Add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is soft and lightly caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

2. Add the fish stock and corn and bring to a boil. Add the milk, crab, clams, and mussels. Return the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat so the liquid is simmering. Cook gently, uncovered, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the clams open and the mussels have started to pop.

3. Stir in the tomato paste, cream, lime juice, coriander, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook gently for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.

4. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the cilantro and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Divide the clams, mussels, and crab evenly among bowls and ladle the sauce over the top. Garnish with the lemon wedges.

NOTE: Before cooking clams or mussels, remove the small muscles and black line at the neck. Remove beards from mussels by pulling them out with your fingers. To debeard clams, pick through them to remove any pieces of shell or sand.

# Mussels with Sweet Peppers, Pancetta, and Thyme

Pulpo a la Gallega

On a recent trip to the Canary Islands, I had some amazing mussels at a place in Puerto del Carmen, called La Marina. The mussels were served in a sweet, syrupy broth that contained lots of peppers and garlic—the result was an explosion of salty, sweet, and peppery flavors. I decided to try my own variation with tomatoes, red peppers, and pancetta. I'm not a huge fan of pancetta, but for this recipe I actually use the pancetta fat instead of olive oil.

One 6-ounce package pancetta, finely chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

4 sprigs fresh thyme (about ¼ bunch)

2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

6 canned plum tomatoes, crushed by hand, with their juices

3 cups vegetable or chicken stock

3 cups water

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil

One 32-ounce can crushed tomatoes

3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried oregano

¼ cup finely chopped fresh basil leaves

4 pounds mussels (see Note), scrubbed and debearded (see Note)

¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, for garnish

1. In a large pot, such as a Dutch oven, cook the pancetta over medium-low heat, stirring, until lightly browned and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the thyme, vinegar, crushed tomatoes, stock, water, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the canned tomatoes and break up the tomatoes into the pan using the back of a spoon or a large whisk. Season with the salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon salt. Cook until the liquid reduces and the sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley and oregano and keep warm.

3. Add the mussels to the tomato mixture and cook over high heat until the mussels open, about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed so the mussels cook quickly without overcooking. Stir in the basil and parsley and season with salt. Divide among bowls and ladle the sauce over the top.

SERVES 6

NOTE: Mussels are so delicate that you don't really need to debeard them. To remove the black line from clams, use your fingers to pull out the line and discard.

# Fish Tacos with Cilantro Crema

Tacos al Pastor

Layering taco fillings between tortillas makes for a great appetizer—not just when it comes to tacos but when you're looking to make an elegant meal for a casual party. The meat used in this particular taco is al pastor—marinated beef shank. While al pastor may sound unusual, it's not as unusual as you might think. The marinade usually contains spices, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, onion, and chili paste. These marinades are often sold in small tubs in grocery stores. Look for them to make your own tacos or to take them to a party as a clever, easy appetizer.

Marinate the shanks overnight or at least for 3 hours in the refrigerator.

FOR THE AL PASTOR

2 tablespoons soy sauce

2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

2 teaspoons light brown sugar

2 teaspoons honey

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

3 pounds beef short ribs (about 2)

FOR THE CILANTRO CREMA

1 cup sour cream

¼ cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems (from about ¼ bunch)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

FOR THE TORTILLAS

10 corn tortillas, preferably made with nixtamalized (see Note) corn

1. Make the tacos. To make the marinade, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and 1 tablespoon salt in a medium bowl. Stir until well combined. Place the short ribs in a large sealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over them. Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.

2. Place a grill rack in a gas or charcoal grill. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. For the al pastor, cook the meat until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 140°F, about 5 minutes on each side.

3. Place the tortillas in a large bowl. Set the bowl near the grill. Stack the tortillas as they are grilled and wrap them in foil to keep warm while you grill the remaining tortillas. Stack the grilled tortillas on a platter.

4. To serve, lay out each tortilla and top it with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the al pastor and some of the crema. Roll the tortilla into a burrito shape and place it on a plate. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.

NOTE: Nixtamalized corn, also called hominy, is corn that has been treated with mineral salts and is cooked as you would rice. I love nixtamalized corn because it's easy to digest, has a flavor similar to that of fresh corn, and has a softer texture than regular corn. You can buy nixtamalized corn or even make your own.

# Seared Chicken and Vegetable Fajitas with Serrano-Citrus Salsa Verde

Fajitas al Carbón con Cilantro

This is an easy and fun dish that uses the grill. Be sure to salt the vegetables very well so that they don't come out soggy when grilling. The combination of grilled salsa and sweet grilled peppers is the perfect match for a citrus-spiked salsa.

2 red bell peppers

2 yellow bell peppers

2 zucchini

2 plum tomatoes

1 medium red onion, peeled and cut into thin wedges

½ cup extra-virgin olive oil

2 tablespoons chopped garlic (about 6 cloves)

2 teaspoons salt, plus extra as needed

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra as needed
