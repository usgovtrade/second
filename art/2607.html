"I'm gonna be big when I get out." "I want to be like you when I get out." " What do you want to be?" " A fireman." "That's the highest, ain't it?" "No, it's not." "A cop maybe?" "There ain't no higher." "Yeah, a fireman or a cop." "I got something figured out for you when you get out." "What?" "I want you to carry a fireman's hose." "Look, if it happens we can get one of the girls to help out with the pumping, okay?" "You're crazy." "How can you breathe all that shit?" "That's crazy." "I'll help you out when I get out." "You could live with my old lady, she'd help you out with the old man." "I don't want them, I don't want nobody." "You said you were going to quit because I don't let you go to them." "You're a damn liar." "You're a damn liar, because I ain't said that." "Don't you come around here saying I said that, or I'll whip you, hear?" "You hear?" "You're just a crazy mother from downstairs." "That's why I got a fool for a father and no one." "You hear me, Tony?" "You hear me, Anthony?" "I hear you." "Go on downstairs, I don't want to talk to you." "What do you want?" "Go in that room." "I wanna talk to you." "I told you not to come around here, that's all you get from me." "I didn't come to make a damn thing with you, but it's to make you see what you're not doing." "That's what I want." "You can take that way if you want to." "I'm staying here until you talk to me." "What you wanna do?" "I came to talk to you, that's what I want, talk." "You think I'm gonna give up and say "Okay," and it's okay?" "That's not what I want." "Why not?" "You do things to me." "You do things to me, I don't like that." "I don't like that when you make me feel something that I don't want to feel." "What do you want?" "Go upstairs." "Go upstairs, do something." "Shut the door and do something." "Make me understand." "What do you want from me?" "I don't want nothing." "Just talk to me, huh?" "Do something then, go on upstairs." "You want to play, right?" "Go ahead and play, then." "Why not?" "You can't play here, let's play." "You play." "I know you play." "You play upstairs." "Go on, upstairs." "Go ahead." "Don't you wanna play with me?" "Come on, you're no fun, you know." "You don't wanna play with me." "You're a bastard." "You can't play with me." "You talk." "You talk to me all the time, you don't wanna play." "Upstairs now." "Go on, upstairs." "When I want to talk to you..." "You never want to talk to me." "Why, what am I supposed to say to you?" "What do you want me to say?" "Do something, then." "All right, get away from me!" "Go on, upstairs." "Go on, upstairs." "You just wait till I'm ready for you!" "You can't play with me, I told you!" "You're no good!" "Why don't you go home?" "Go home." "Why are you mad at me?" "Do you wanna hurt me?" "What are you doing?" "Come on, Tony, go home, come on." "Go ahead, go ahead." "What's the matter with you, huh?" "Why are you always angry?" "Why do you get angry?" "Go home." "You want me to leave?" "Come on, go home, what do you want me to do?" "I wanna talk to you." "Tell me what you want, come on." "What you wanna do?" "Why don't you go home?" "Get away from me!" "Go upstairs, see if I care!" "You go home, you go home!" "You want to stay with your things, huh?" "Why do you care?" "You wanna play upstairs with them?" "Play with them." "I don't care!" "Go home!" "What are you doing?" "Come on!" "Why did you tell him I was at home?" "I was!" "What do you want?" "You're angry at me, too?" "I'm gonna make you get dressed." "Come on, get dressed!" "You go home!" "Why?" "Why?" "You go home!" "Go home!" "I'm gonna take care of you." "If you can't behave, I'll leave you." "You wanna stay with him?" "What am I supposed to do?" "You think I'm an angel?" "You wanna stay with him?" "Why are you upset with me?" "You stay there, you!" "I don't wanna hurt you." "I love you." "You're beautiful." "You're my wife." "You're beautiful." "You stay there." "You stay there!" "Oh, my God." "Anthony?" "What's the matter?" "What's the matter, what happened?" "Who done it?" "How did it happen?" "Who did it?" "What?" "My hand, my hand." "My beautiful hand." "Get a doctor." "Get a doctor, quick!" "Oh, no!" "No!" "No!" "No!" "Mommy, come on." "Hurry." "Anthony, come on, let's go." "No, you're staying here." "Mommy, we can't stay here." "Please, please." "Take care of her." "You okay?" "I'm all right." "Go downstairs, I'll be right there." "Go, go." "Hello?" "This is Mrs. Beadle." "I want to talk to Mr. Hallam." "I want to ask him to forgive me." "We can't come to the phone right now." "Please leave a message after the beep." "He's not gonna forgive me." "I know I've been bad." "I'm so sorry for what I did." "I know I've been bad, but he shouldn't hate me." "You better tell him that." "I'll never do anything bad like that again." "Just tell him I'll do anything he wants." "I'll do anything, I'll be good." "I'll do anything, I won't touch it again." "You tell him, please tell him." "Tell him I'm sorry, tell him I'll love him forever, please." "Tony?" "Yeah, I'm gonna make him come back to me." "You tell him, Tony." "I'm gonna make him come back to me, I swear I'll make him happy." "He's gonna be happy again." "No, no, no." "Oh, please, God." "Tony, what is it?" "Tony, what's wrong?" "Tony!" "Tony!" "No!" "Anthony!" "What's happening?" "Take her down to her mother, quick!" "Go down and take her out." "I'll call an ambulance." "I'll get her out of here." "I don't wanna go." "I'm afraid of the dark." "Please, it's dark down there." "Get her out of here, go on!" "Hurry, take her out of here!" "Let's go." "Oh, my God!" "Tony!" "Tony!" "Oh, my God!" "Oh, my God, I love you." "I need you." "I need you, I love you." "Please don't go." "No, no, Tony, no!" "Don't go!" "Oh, Tony!" "Come on, please, no!" "You can't!" "Anthony!" "Tony!" "No!" "Let me go, you can't!" "No!" "You promised!" "Please!" "Let me go!" "Please don't go!" "Please, Tony, no!" "Come on!" "You can't!" "Tony!" "Tony!" "Come on, please, no!" "Don't go!" "Please!" "No!" "No!" "No!" "Please!" "Please, Tony!" "Come on!" "Tony!" "Tony, no!" "Don't go!" "No!" "Don't go!" "No!" "I love you, Tony."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:47
