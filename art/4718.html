What is the origin of this expression, "Sweat of the (blank) Biscuit"?

I am from the United Kingdom.  In the past few years I have been exposed to many expressions in the music world, mostly American and a few Caribbean (although I haven't seen that much of that).  I often see the expression Sweat of the Biscuit, which seems to mean that "stuff" doesn't mean much and is often used in a positive sense.

"Come on now, Sweat of the Biscuit. Don't be so pessimistic, you
  gotta love the old car more than I do."
"That was a good one, and I like your style Sweat of the Biscuit."
"Your words just left me wondering how one can Sweat of the
  Biscuit. Don't you think it's time to change the title?"

What is the origin of this expression?

A:

It is a phrase that describes someone that is too negative and pessimistic. It is a regional American expression originating in the South. 
Sweat of the shirt is related.  

'Sweat of the shirt' is a Southern expression meaning someone who is very negative and pessimistic. The phrase is often used in a playful way.

It's from American English and the first two examples are from the USA. A good explanation is provided on a website for the University of Richmond (UoR):

When someone is constantly putting others down, that person is said to be "sweating the small stuff". This may take place while someone is trying to make others feel better and get them excited about something, so as not to let the moment pass without having everyone's attention. This person may also be trying to motivate the group to work harder and be more productive.
The term “sweat of the biscuit” is used when something is not worth sweating. It refers to a person who is constantly negative and negative, always seeing the glass as half empty.  Someone who is using this phrase when the object is to get more of something or to do better, but is not having much success, does not know how to make himself happy. He also does not know how to stop thinking about everything in a negative manner.
A similar expression used in the South is “sour grape.” It refers to a person that has no positive contributions or efforts, but criticizes and talks negatively about others.

A:

sweat of the shirt, 
(idiomatic) A negative attitude that keeps a person from enjoying the good things in life.
(US) Sweat of the Biscuit
(UK) Sweat of the Bushel

All these seem to be variants of the more direct sense.

the expression "sweat of the shirt" has been used since at least 1871

Wikipedia 

"Biscuit" is American Southern slang for the forehead. The phrase "sweat of the biscuit" in the second sense has been used since at least 1915.

All of these expressions are variants of "sweating the small stuff"
From Merriam-Webster's Dictionary:

sweat of the shirt "a persistent grouch or sourpuss"
sweat of the biscuit "a person who complains, whines, or complains about small matters"
sweat of the biscuit "informal, an extremely untrustworthy person"

The use of "biscuit" to refer to the head (or forehead) seems to have come from a folk etymology that the biscuit is the equivalent of bread in a basket and is baked at a lower temperature than the bread. This seems like an odd use of "biscuit". 
You can read more about the history of the expression here. 
So, if I read your question correctly, the origins are American.
