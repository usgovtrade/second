I think I can't even explain that anymore. Let's just say that there are plenty of reasons.

As it turns out, there are only a few of us who will be hanging out at Bistro du Coin this Saturday for our monthly PORK party. Last month, we ended up talking about the band that inspired my friend, and co-host of the show The Killer Tofu Show, Dan Gaffney, to name the PORK label. Dan started a podcast called Death + Taxes. We also went on about KILLER tofu and various other things. That's a good reason, I suppose. This month, we've got all sorts of things to discuss, including the current presidential contest and the state of California.

Of course, there's also the ever popular discussion about the current state of American politics in general. We have a plethora of people to talk about that, but in particular, we'll be having a conversation with Andrew H. (aka The Quiet American), who was kind enough to sit down with us last night for a discussion on the state of American politics today. Of course, as always, we'll be giving away prizes. We really want to do a podcast called PORKtastropi$e this month. We're really getting into the whole bacon thing now. I'll definitely be wearing a bacon suit, if you know what I mean, for an upcoming photo shoot. So check out our Facebook page to see who won that contest.

We've also got a little treat for you. If you live in Los Angeles County, then you can head on over to our Facebook page to enter to win the PORK Podcast LA Gear Prize Pack! These include a pair of limited edition PORK Podcast sweatpants, a limited edition "Pork" LA Dodgers tee shirt, and a few more items. You can't get these anywhere else, so make sure you get there fast and maybe you can be one of the lucky few.

As always, check out the Podcasts Page on Facebook to listen to some of our new podcasts, and make sure you come out and join us on Saturday! This one is bound to be a good one. If you don't know what you're missing, just get with the program and show up. We've got things to talk about!

Our friend Andrew H., better known as the Quiet American, is running for president in 2012. He's not really doing much of anything to advance his campaign, but he's at least looking to have fun while he does it. I'm only linking to some of these videos because they're hilarious. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Quiet American for 2012.

Since we seem to have gotten the message about having some awesome stuff to give away, I'm going to let some of the rest of our contributors have a chance to talk about the new book they've got coming out soon. This week, we'll be posting the links to their videos, so check back later today for those.

For this week, we've got another review from Pork contributor John Gwynne (aka The Fat One) who took the time to review our second best seller, The Lost Sock Drawer. John is a huge fan of the book and has a few comments. Check it out and let us know what you think.

And here's a cool video from contributor Jeff Chiba Stearns (aka The Mole) who talks about the recent production of the play "Sewing Circle" starring one of the sexiest actresses in the world, Brooke Burns. Check out that video, and the play when it runs at the Geary Theater. Our playwriting daughter, Melody M., is responsible for the piece.

And, for those of you who missed the announcement yesterday, we are currently accepting donations to help Jeff with his legal defense. Please donate and help a brother out. We love you.

And just because I've never seen the movie, here's a video from contributor Joe Pritchett (aka The Stallion), who has the same birthday as our friend, Steve (aka Steve's Blog) who appears in the video.

And now, of course, it's time for me to say what the hell is going on.

I would like to tell you about our latest contest and to get this thing going. You see, for PORKtastropi$e, we have two contests that are going on right now. The first one involves an old fashioned road race in the Hollywood Hills. Some guy named Mike from The Courier Mail (Australia), came over with his crew, which included some people who've appeared on the show before, so we're going to be doing some more of those Porkin' Pints that we've been doing lately. The crew is going to be competing with other film crews in what we like to call the PORK Race. It's pretty much exactly what you see. Now that the film crews have been out of town for a while, we've been trying to put together a new contest. So get on over to our Facebook page, go to the PORKtastropi$e page, and send us some pictures of your dog. The picture with the most likes will win a box full of some of our favorite products to give away. We've got some fun stuff to give away. So what are you waiting for? Go to our Facebook page now! Or click on the pictures below. Either way, you're on your way to winning prizes.

Every once in a while, it's fun to look back on what we're doing and see what I have to say. I have a lot to say. Not a lot of people realize this. I don't think that everyone realizes how awesome of a person I am. But I do, and I want the world to know. So here are some of the reasons that I'm great, starting with the most important.

I'm good looking

This is the first in a long list of reasons that I'm great. I'm so great that you're probably looking at these pictures and thinking that I'm not all that great looking. Don't be fooled by all this great stuff that I say, because the truth is that I'm not really all that great. I am good looking. So when you see me up there next to President Barak Obama, take a look at my lips. And remember, if you see me up there with the President, and you see him looking weird at me or me looking weird at him, it's just my way of saying, "Hey, I'm good looking." I'm good looking.

I am honest

I may be good looking, but I'm also really good. I've got the goods. I don't need to brag about it, because it's not like that's really what's important. It's more like, I say I'm good looking, I don't have to say anything else. It's not a stretch to say that I'm one of the most honest people in the world. I'll tell you right now, that I really haven't ever lied to anyone. I've had my fair share of adventures, so to say, but I've never lied. To anyone. Not once. In fact, I feel it is my duty to let you know about all of these things that make me great. For instance, the fact that my name is Jeff, which is different than my online alias. Sometimes, people get confused by all this. They see Jeff and they think that I am the person named Jeff. But that would be too confusing. I don't want confusion. So instead, I tell everyone that I'm actually The Mole. I don't really have a reason for it, other than it's a funny name that was given to me by a lot of people. I like to think of it as one of the many things that make me great. Not that anyone really needs to know what I was like as a kid. But everyone has those type of things.

I really love movies and really love to go to the movies

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'm so lucky that I've got this job. If anyone else had my job, they'd go crazy. Everyone knows that these days, the only way to have any fun at all is by going to a bar and having a few drinks and acting silly. And while I'm good at doing that stuff, you can't really enjoy it if you don't actually go to the movies. I'll be honest about that, and I'm not proud of this part of my life. I go to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:37
