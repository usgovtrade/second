I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things." 
"I forgot." 
"You forgot? You forgot? Don't ever forget. 
In all the games we have played, you never forgot. 
"Come over here and sit down." 
"Okay." 
"Chris, did you take this game seriously?" 
"Yes." 
"Not at all?" 
"Not at all." 
"All right, we are going to practice. 
Do you know what you need to do?" 
"Pretend to like you?" 
"No, Chris, you know that. 
We need to keep pretending that we know how to 
play the game, otherwise it is not going to work." 
"Okay." 
"Chris, this is a game of strategy. 
You need to take this game seriously." 
"Do you really think so?" 
"Absolutely." 
"I was never very good at games. 
I wonder if you can win." 
"Well, 
remember that we have you, Chris, and the rock. 
If you can beat the rock, it is the same as winning." 
"Okay, I will try to be good." 
"No, not you. 
The rock." 
"I don't understand." 
"You don't understand? Do you understand this?" 
"Please don't hurt me!" 
"If you hurt the rock, we will hurt you." 
"Don't hurt me." 
"Okay, we have enough games for today. 
I think you need to go to your dorm." 
"But I have to play with you guys." 
"And you do that when we feel you are ready. 
I will see you tomorrow, Chris. 
Try to remember that I warned you." 
As Chris left my office, I could tell that he 
wasn't going to be good at this game. 
I knew that no matter how I treated him, it was 
not going to work. 
At least he had Chris for the night.
