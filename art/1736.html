At the very least, it should be a call to action for those of us who support the public health benefits of marijuana legalization, as well as all the individuals and communities who depend on them. It should be a call to action for anyone concerned with drug policy. It should be a call to action for us to stop and reflect on our role in the ongoing addiction and suffering plaguing our country, our communities and our loved ones. The Great Divide should be a call to action for each one of us to reach out and make a difference.

In his book, "The Great Divide: Cannabis in our society and in our minds," historian Richard Evans paints a vivid picture of our country’s past and, more important, what may be to come. As he and his colleagues have researched the changing attitudes toward drug use in recent decades, they made a startling discovery:

In 1980, when asked if they supported the legalization of all drugs, 60 percent of Americans responded with a simple "no." By 2015, only 27 percent said they did not support legalization. When asked whether they thought marijuana should be legal, 73 percent said yes.

The Great Divide is not simply a look back on our history. In the current climate of hostility toward the cannabis industry and criminalization of cannabis users, many are calling for a return to a "Just Say No" perspective on drug use. There is a growing call to end the ban on research using the plant as well.

As part of his research, Evans traveled the country to visit and interview members of the drug reform movement. He and his team met with everyone from political candidates running for office to the heads of national drug policy organizations. While their interviews were diverse and their individual agendas were diverse, their answers to the same basic questions about marijuana use, drug war budgets and criminal justice were clear.

"For all the talk about legalization, the cannabis movement appears to be more a movement to legalize and a movement to decriminalize. A movement to legalize might be stronger if it also advocated for ending the criminalization of cannabis use, and it might be stronger if it were even clearer about its goals and tactics," Evans writes. "But in their answers, it became clear that advocates for change understand that this is part of a struggle for public opinion and political power as well as for the hearts and minds of the American people."

This is why we so desperately need you, the readers, to make a difference. In the same way those advocates have tried to shape public opinion in recent years, we can shape policy here at home.

Your voice, and those of your elected officials, have an important role to play. We urge you to educate yourself on the facts about cannabis and the current status of marijuana policy at home and abroad. Get involved. If there is something you can do, we encourage you to make an impact.

If you're ever in the area, please come by and say hello. We'd love to meet you and chat about what you've seen in your travels. Whether you're a fellow cannabis consumer or a concerned citizen, we hope to welcome you in the fold.

For now, read on and find out where we stand as a nation. And, for what it's worth, let me end with this. It took us centuries to decimate our native plant, and another century to ban it, but we're finally starting to learn from our mistakes.

If cannabis prohibition were a person, it would be on death row. Yet, as a matter of fact, we're still killing it, just with a lot of misdirected laws and misplaced blame.

If prohibition is the reason for this country's ills, surely there are much better ways to fight such an evil force than through the blunt and immoral tool of murder.

The way to end the war on weed is to keep on giving — whether it's as a member of your favorite band, or as an activist on the front lines of the cause.

With our passion, dedication and power, we can make a real difference.

We have to win this war, and we know how.

This is it, America. Let's do this. Let's win this fight. Let's show them.
