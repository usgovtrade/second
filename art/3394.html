**NIGHTLIFE**

Nightlife in Boulogne-sur-Mer and the surrounding areas revolves around the bars and cafés along the corniche, and in particular the Hotel Palais des Festivals—the hub of the local town action—and the smaller Café Riva overlooking the beach in the center of town. The nightlife starts at the end of the day, around 8 pm, with a flurry of activity on the Cours Saleya and around the square. The bars and cafés keep going all night, if not until 3 am, thanks to the easy access to booze.

Bar-Club La P'tite Maison. You'd never guess this place was a restaurant from its name or layout; the decor is ultracool and youthful and music fans flock here for a night of funky jamming and grooving. The interior is all exposed stone, dark wood, and bare brick, with tables and chairs inside and out, so you can just keep right on partying.   _Pl. de P'tite-Ville | 06130_   _05–59–13–06–40_   _www.lapittemaison.com_.

Bar de Village. This is a charming little bar, a bit rough and ready in decor but in a nice funky way—just the place for a drink by day and the ideal spot to hang out on a summer's evening. Music here is a mix of easy listening and easy love—just the kind of thing for a young crowd.   _18 bis, rue de l'Université, P'tit Vieux Marché_   _05–59–51–22–98_.

## **MARSEILLE**

2 km (1½ miles) east of the Vieux Port (Old Port), 30 km (19 miles) south of Cannes, 70 km (44 miles) southwest of Nice, 75 km (47 miles) northwest of Aix-en-Provence, 95 km (59 miles) east of Avignon, 150 km (93 miles) east of Lyon, and 230 km (143 miles) east of Paris.

Marseille is all about life on the street. If you approach from the New Port, the massive concrete dock, you're greeted by a startling view of a city of contrasts: miles of bleak factories, huge power station, and a few low-slung suburbs, interspersed with blocks of old buildings in a pretty pastel color scheme, and a forest of spindly minarets crowning the highest points. From the Vieux Port, at the edge of the Old Port, rue de la République marks the beginning of the Rive Neuve (New Street). On this street you'll find some of Marseille's oldest buildings and the famous open-air fish market—where, according to Provençal legend, the city's inhabitants were all originally turned into stone—as well as a vast flower market that stretches out along the Corniche. Once a fishing port with an active slave trade, Marseille is today the main European port for migrants from Africa and the Middle East, which gives its colorful streets an exotic air. Along the way you'll pass the historic cathedral, a Roman ruin turned into a Christian church and a fort, the Palais Longchamp, the prison, the imposing Bourse (Stock Exchange), the Opéra, and the Quartier République.

The Vieux Port is home to Marseille's most prestigious restaurants, such as the Michelin-starred l'Atelier du Jean, as well as the city's main tourist office, known for its helpful and efficient staff, and a good selection of shops.

GETTING HERE AND AROUND

Frequent buses leave from the main bus station and the main train station in the St-Charles neighborhood and serve every stop along the coastal route between Aix-en-Provence and the Corniche des Accoules. Marseille's main train station, Gare St-Charles, is a major node in France's rail system. Several TGV (high-speed trains) from Paris arrive here each day. Intercités trains, local trains connecting Marseille to other French towns, take about an hour and 20 minutes to go the whole length of the Marseille–Nice route. In winter, the main train station in the suburb of Saint-Charles is used by trains connecting Marseille to Aix-en-Provence, Cassis, and Nice.

Bus and ferry links connect Marseille with several other Mediterranean ports: Bari (Italy), Naples (Italy), Toulon (France), Ventimiglia (Italy), Nice, and Ajaccio (France). You can also sail from Marseille to Naples aboard a passenger ferry (in season only).

TOURS

Le Petit Train. If you're interested in a little more than the Marseille–Corniche–Calanques shoreline, Marseille's Petit Train is your best bet. The 2½-hour trip takes you out to Fort St-Nicolas and back through the Vieux Port and the Quartier du Panier; tickets are €8.60 each. Tours leave every two hours (except 11 pm–1 am) and take place daily year-round, though they tend to be less frequent in winter. The train starts at the western end of the Vieux Port, near the Notre</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:09
