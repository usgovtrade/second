After the experience of working on a website with a bunch of other people — learning and teaching in various scenarios — has a special taste that only comes with hard work and the satisfaction of seeing your work paying off. Our current interns and future members of the Tutor team are an incredible group of talent who come from all walks of life. We get the opportunity to teach them more about what we do, how we do it, and of course they teach us more about the world around us.

From our interns, we’ve gotten valuable insights into our current processes and have begun to introduce them to our entire web development team. And from the team, we’ve been given ideas on how to improve on processes already in place. All this valuable knowledge and communication is key to getting our team on a good footing for a new year!

And of course interns are just that — fun to work with. They’re always asking questions and working hard to learn the tools and best practices, and are never afraid to make an off the wall suggestion to make our jobs better. We always appreciate those kind of suggestions.

All in all we can’t thank our interns enough for their work and dedication. They really help to set a great example for our team and help to shape their future career goals. And they help us push our projects forward by providing us with an insightful new perspective. In return, we strive to ensure that our work is interesting and worthwhile, which really shows in the product we’re able to create with them as the driving force.

On that note, I’ll leave you with some pictures of our newest members of the Tutor team — I can only hope that you all stay a while and meet some of these talented people.

Our newest, super talented full time employee and all around fun person is Brian. Brian joined the Tutor team on August 8th of this year, and it was only a few days after our annual user conference. That’s when Brian really got a feel for our vision of not only creating an incredible product, but making an amazing team environment in which to do so. You can find Brian just trying to have fun on the go over here.

That’s where he’s at now, and as he said, it is where he will stay for the foreseeable future. While it has been hard work in the beginning to catch on and understand all the different parts of Tutor’s infrastructure, it was all for a good cause. Since the beginning of the semester, Brian has learned enough to be an integral part of the team, learning all the things necessary to expand and refine our product as he continues to grow.

Brian’s also not the only new member of the team — we now have our three latest and greatest interns from University of Toronto (Kelsi, Caitlin, and Emily). I love how Kelsi and Emily got a sneak peak at the internship site right before I did. Emily’s always getting involved in our team. She’s a major contributor to our team’s productivity and always has a smile on her face. I’m pretty sure that just walking around the office will bring you sunshine from just watching Emily. (And don’t worry about Kelsi, we took care of her well and she’s working hard too.)

Our team members get along like a family and it shows in the product they’ve been able to develop together. And while there have been challenges (you try having 12 people work on something at the same time), we always find a way around them and do our best to continue to build and improve a product that we’re all very proud of.

Now on to the big part. We’re excited to introduce to you our intern class of 2013! We will have five interns joining the Tutor team for the remainder of this year. I’ll also take this time to acknowledge our 2014 intern class, who worked very hard at making last year’s intern class (see the article below) extremely happy.

Intern 2014

In the last few months of 2013, many of our students in our 2013 intern class went out and got themselves jobs, we got together to celebrate a terrific 12 months, and we had a lovely Christmas party. It was at our Christmas party where we celebrated the last 12 months with our interns and introduced a new group of talented people. It was a great way to ring in the new year and get everyone ready for the coming semester!

And, of course, we’re all looking forward to another great year with the intern class of 2014. These individuals really make our team the best it can be, and we are very happy to continue working with them.

The following video features a few of the talented interns:

As I’ve said, I look forward to hearing about your internship experiences, challenges, successes and anything you want to talk about. We really want to make sure that you enjoy your time in our Tutor office, and continue to love what you’re doing. And we want to hear from you too, about the great opportunities you’ve had, or challenges you’ve faced, and what you plan to do in the future. We can make suggestions as well if there are topics that you would like us to write about in the coming months. As always, stay tuned to the blog for more news and updates.

Have a wonderful holiday season and start looking ahead to 2014!

The Tutor office is closed from December 24, 2013 until January 1, 2014. Please contact us by January 2, 2014 and you can expect a response the following day.

Since many of our interns make a weekly salary as a part time worker, we will be closing down our Tutor offices in order to regroup and focus on the remainder of the 2014 fall semester.
