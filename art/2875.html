If you're doing a longer run that's four or more hours long, then make sure you have some fuel for it.

After you finish, it's likely that you'll be ravenously hungry, so try to be prepared by planning meals in advance. You should also keep some quick and easy foods in your fridge so that you're not tempted to go for the fast food.

_Fuel your recovery_. A good way to speed up your recovery is to start it off with a meal. This is especially true if you know that your next activity will be a short one—say a thirty-minute run—because your body needs to store as much fuel as possible from your training meal. If your recovery runs are longer than an hour and you'll have to work the next day, then fuel them after your workout, but don't plan on having a meal. You'll need to wait a few hours after your workout before a meal is best. If you have a race or other hard training session that you've planned for the next day, make sure you eat the right foods an hour before the workout so your body will be able to deal with the stress.

_Try to get to know your body._ Your body is going to give you clues when it's ready for a food, which is why it's so important to get to know how it responds to different foods. You can begin by figuring out which foods make you feel fuller, more energized, and more happy. You can then create a plan of the foods you'll eat on different days. Most runners take a good look at their lives and realize that it's a lot easier to stick with a plan if they choose meals that will make them happy and don't result in hangry episodes. A third thing you should consider is the timing of your workouts and your meals so that you are fueling up for them at the right time.

_Be smart._ It doesn't matter how prepared you are or how knowledgeable you are about foods and nutrition, if you eat the wrong things you'll be messing up your body. Not only can this lead to weight gain, but it also can affect how you feel in a negative way. So if you plan to eat out or have something different that's not on the schedule, have it as a treat after your day is done. This way you don't spoil your healthy eating by overeating.

## EASE IN

The EASY-In Diet is going to guide you to eating the same foods on your runs that will help you perform your best. These foods contain carbs and protein and are quick to digest, so you can use them on your runs. There are three meals per day to choose from, depending on what's convenient for you. You don't have to follow the exact schedule I outline here, but the idea is that you eat one meal within an hour of running, another two hours after that, and then a third meal an hour before bed. This way, you get some fuel in the middle of the day and before bed, which is when you may find yourself really craving a quick snack or carbohydrate.

When it comes to fueling your runs, it's important to consume enough carbohydrate during your runs so you have enough fuel left to keep going. If you feel that you are lacking energy on your runs, try adding another meal and increase your fueling in the morning. You don't have to eat every single time, but if you find that you're running more slowly or have slower times for your intervals, you may want to eat more.

## WHAT TO EAT ON YOUR RIDES

When you're on a long run, you may feel like you have to pack everything you want to eat into one meal. For a few weeks, try packing your car with nutrition and drinks so that you always have something to drink on your runs. On the other hand, if it's just a few miles or a couple of hours, I have no problem just having a Gu Chomps and some water.

When you're on a run that's less than an hour or two long, you can have a full meal—and it's fine to eat it during your run. But if you've been on a really long run or an interval workout, you may feel like you need something more substantial to eat. The EASY-In Diet will give you a meal for your evening run and a breakfast to enjoy the next morning.

The goal is that your runs should be fueling your life rather than the other way around. Here are some other things you can do that are simple and quick but make a huge difference in the quality of your runs.

### DO HIIT WORKOUTS

HIIT (high intensity interval training) is one of my favorite training sessions to do, as they are quick and easy to fit in, but they are also an intense form of interval training, which makes them go down fast. If you do HIIT before your runs, you'll get a natural boost to your energy levels so that you can go at your hardest when it's time for the run. But don't overdo it! If you keep up the HIIT, then you could end up overdoing it on your run. I see that all the time, and the runner who has just done a HIIT session finds that he runs much harder than he did the day before. He's worked his body too hard and then ends up feeling tired or dizzy. That's why the EASY-In Diet is going to teach you to pace yourself and to be smart with your food.

### BE SMART WITH YOUR FOODS

I have seen the EASY-In Diet go over big on social media. Sometimes people start with a diet that includes fruits and veggies and they wonder why their runs aren't any better. The reason is simple. They are overdoing it on their fruits and veggies. They may be doing two workouts per day with some intense strength training in between, and so they eat all the fruits and veggies they need to get their protein. Then when they go on a run, their body is full of sugar and water. It's hard to find the energy, so the best solution is to go back to just one workout or eat more often.

### PAUSE, REST, AND STRETCH

If you work out hard in the gym, it's important that you also do some stretching. When you're running, you should get in the habit of stretching before and after your run and to stretch right after you get off the bike or the treadmill. A simple one-minute stretch after your run can really be enough, but if you need more, then you'll need to increase your flexibility and have longer stretches to stay healthy.

### GO TO BED EARLY

I'm not a fan of the late-night snack or a big meal before bed because it often keeps you up in the night or wakes you up in the middle of the night. I'm a big believer in eating a light snack during the day or having a nice small meal before bed. It will help you fall asleep and keep you calm in the evening when you can't sleep and are hungry, tired, and stressed. The EASY-In Diet gives you a lot of good options for eating on your run and after dinner for an evening snack, so if you need a pick-me-up at night, make sure to have a healthy meal and avoid going to bed hungry. The extra energy will go a long way and help you sleep better.

### PRACTICE THE FUELLING RULES

I've put together some rules to help you fuel your runs, which I call the FUELING RULES. They are simple and will help you train your body to perform at its best when you're on a run. I know you may be a little bit scared, but you're already putting in the hard work by running. We want you to be able to eat on your run and avoid problems later because of eating too much and not having enough fuel. These are the basics that you'll need to know, so try to stick to the rules as much as you can.

The first rule is this: Eat the same meal every time for at least twenty-four hours. It's much easier to stick with your eating plan if you stick to it. If you start following the EASY-In Diet, you will soon find that it becomes like any other routine—you will continue to do it because it works for you. If you think about when you eat and try to stick to it, you won't have as many problems when you run.

The second rule is that if you have one of your regular meals, you can have a small meal or snack about two hours after you finish your run. This is a good way to make sure you have enough fuel for your next run if you've been eating only breakfast and lunch.

The third rule is to eat every three hours. If you work a nine-to-five day, then that will be enough for you to follow the EASY-In Diet. If you are training on your day off, I recommend you eat every three hours no matter what, especially if you are doing two workouts. It may take more planning, but the best way to have it done is to take a meal and put it on the schedule, so that you don't get hungry. If you keep up these guidelines, you won't feel</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:48
