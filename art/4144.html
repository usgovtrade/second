Is there anything you need more than this? - yread

I'm no Lighter evangelist, but as an app developer, I want to try it. Is there
anything so compelling about it that I shouldn't wait until someone is kind
enough to release an Android port?

Also, what's with the video? How does your product do a video better than
Google App Engine does video?

~~~
yread
It's really just about your browser, it doesn't interfere with your normal
behavior. I've put it on my site and it loads quite fast. There are options to
disable animations. The app will have more to offer.

~~~
tptacek
So is Google App Engine. They don't have a video either. I want to try your
app, I'm just wondering if I should wait or go now.

The code can be found here: <http://github.com/lighter/morph>

I am a Lighter addict. Now what would I use it for?

Very nice! You should include a link to a demo.

You should have had the foresight to not give your demo a stupid URL (it
looks/feels like an ad to me). In the future I'll think twice before going
there and potentially wasting time.

Hey guys, we added a short intro video:
<http://vimeo.com/7649936>

I think the best features of Lighter are fast and simple image compression
(using GIF as well as jpg) and compression for HTML content like blog posts.
The next thing that would be nice is a gallery and a way to upload images.

Hey, I work at a company (37signals) that uses the word "lighter" in its
branding and marketing. We're very much looking forward to this. Thanks!

stcredzero
Looks really useful. The name is cool and I love that it doesn't send me to
the same site a hundred times.

But is the use of the term "morph" necessary? It's the first time I've seen
the word used in a startup context.

~~~
tptacek
The second time. See also "The Morphogenesis Engine", but the first hit for
that is the "Morph" article from Slashdot. It's the word-of-the-year for
'08\.

I wish you could make it so that the output image could be larger than the
input. I know it would lose quality but sometimes the quality is a little
lacking.

I like this so much better than tumblr. Love how it's so simple and fast.

"We could not find a suitable logo for our logo contest"

What a pity. That says a lot about your site.

you might want to move your domain 'light.co' out of the way or you might
find yourself in a bit of a trademark clash...

~~~
pook
He didn't register it, so as long as he doesn't use it commercially, it
shouldn't be a problem.

~~~
jacquesm
if you're using other peoples' images and their trademarked images you're
likely to find yourself in trouble anyway... a lot of trademark holders don't
want you to show their content in a way other than it was presented originally
(which I can totally understand).

chadboyda
this is awesome! I love simple and well designed things like this. What is
your background? How did you get into web dev? Where are you located?

~~~
yread
I work at a company which makes CMS for newspaper publishers.

I've just been doing web development for fun and for my college's website.

No, I've never heard about this.

Great looking site. I tried the gallery and didn't like it.

~~~
yread
Thanks! Do you have a suggestion for making it better? Maybe I should add a
slider like Tumblr?

~~~
callmeed
Yeah, I really like the layout you have now, but it could use a better
Gallery (more pics, gallery style)

boucher
That's a very pretty site! Good job.

Nice start to the weekend. Is this an Easter egg or does this sort of thing
actually work on real hardware?

------
noor420
that was a cool video!! nice idea!!

redorb
is it going to be released as a plugin for wordpress? (it seems to me that I
am asking this question daily, since wordpress is a platform for blogs)

~~~
mattmaroon
I guess the only way this could possibly be a plugin is if your blog is blog</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:02
