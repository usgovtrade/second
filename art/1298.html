## **ABOUT THE AUTHOR**

Tori Amos is one of the most respected and revered figures in music today. Tori's musical career has spanned over 20 years and has received numerous accolades including two Grammy Awards and seven MTV Video Music Awards. She is the first artist to win 'Artist of the Year' twice at the MTV Video Music Awards for her solo and collaborations. Her music has been described as 'poetry for the soul'. _USA Today_ has described her voice as having the clarity of a 'broken bell'. _Time_ magazine described her as the Queen of American folk music.

Tori has received numerous nominations including four Brit Awards. She was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, an Oscar for 'Best Song', and had her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2005 she was the subject of BBC Four's _Great Britons_ series, with a statue of her being unveiled in New York. In addition to receiving the US President's Volunteer Service Award, she was named by Time Magazine as one of the hundred most influential people in the world.

Tori is currently filming her directorial debut, a concert video for HBO. The original soundtrack has been created and the album released in November 2012.

In 2013, she premiered a stage adaptation of her musical _God of Carnage_ with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and will take the production to London's West End in 2014.

Her other books include: _The Female of the Species_ (co-written with Sarah Waters), _Girls, Girls, Girls_ , and _American Doll Posse_. _The Good Wife_ , her memoir of the writing process, was published in 2013.

Since the release of _The Beekeeper's Apprentice_ , Amos has released six further titles: _Strange Little Girls_ , a compilation album of the musical soundtrack to the film; _The Original Pirate Material_ , an album featuring covers of her own songs; _Live in London_ , an acoustic live CD/DVD; _Midwinter Graces_ , the soundtrack for the PBS/National Geographic movie _Winter's Tale_ ; _Recorded Live: A Memoir in Song_ , a companion book to _The Original Pirate Material_ ; and, in 2015, her most recent book, _A Practical Handbook of Luck_ , described by the _Daily Telegraph_ as 'a beautiful, uplifting, essential, life-affirming read'.

Tori is currently touring around North America and Europe, and is scheduled to play at the following dates in 2013:
