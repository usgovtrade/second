The red lights bleed.

The night,

The city.

The silence is a roar.

Nocturnal people

Stand by

The sidewalks

As fire engines arrive.

Their bodies fall

Smoke and flames

In front of them as they watch

With dead eyes and dead skin.

The firefighters

Run through the crowd

Smoke billowing from their lungs.

The dead standing by.

A woman in dark red lace

Crawls across the street.

Falling, she is saved by a stranger.

A woman with her skirt in her teeth.

Laughing, she pulls away.

The firefighters fall

And lay on the asphalt.

Tilting their bodies in different directions.

They can't tell which way they're facing.

Blackened skin.

Smoke rising

Out of their wounds.

Bodies covered with sweat.

The crowd watches.

The man with pink hair,

Rushing toward the dead,

Smashes them.

Then the one with a beard.

Grabbing people by their heads.

Hanging them on the fire engines.

Cutting their hands.

It's a slaughter in the street.

A mass slaughter on the street.

The crowd becomes a sea of screams.

As fire is burning, in the air.

As fires burn, in the sky.

Fire in the sky and fire in the sea.

As flames are burning on the road.

Smoke is rising

As smoke is burning.

Smoke and flames in the sky.

Burning people on the ground.

People burned alive.

As bodies burn.

Flames and smoke.

Bodies burning and smoking.

Smoke rising

Smoke filling the air.

The crowd is choking in the smoke.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

People burning with smoke.

Smoke is spreading over the ocean.

No smoke is not rising, not flying.

No smoke is rising, not flying.

Smoke and flames on the sidewalk.

Bodies burning on the sidewalk.

Sweat and sweat pouring.

The woman standing in the middle.

Her red hat standing, high in the air.

The man stumbles on the street.

His eyes are glass.

The people passing by are passing.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

They are eating. As smoke is rising, in the air.

They are laughing in their faces. As smoke is rising, in the air.

The man stumbles in the street.

His head is broken.

His eyes are askew.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

The street is covered in people. As smoke is rising, in the air.

With corpses and broken bodies. As smoke is rising, in the air.

Cutting, killing, burning the body.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

The people are still coming.

The people are still driving by.

The people are still killing and burning.

No smoke is rising, not flying.

No smoke is rising, not flying.

The man is bleeding to death.

His broken ribs are broken.

Blood dripping on the asphalt.

The rain covers the street in oil.

The rain covers the street in black.

The rain covers the street in brown.

The rain covers the street in red.

The rain covers the street in blue.

The rain covers the street in green.

The rain covers the street in yellow.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

The rain is black as the street.

The rain is brown as the street.

The rain is red as the street.

The rain is blue as the street.

The rain is green as the street.

The rain is yellow as the street.

The rain and smoke are going away.

The rain and smoke are going up.

The smoke is black and thick.

It's covered in black and dirty water.

When the smoke dissipates, so do the corpses.

The smell of burning bodies and burning corpses.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

The cars are slowing down. As smoke is rising, in the air.

The people are driving by. As smoke is rising, in the air.

They're watching the bodies on the street. As smoke is rising, in the air.

A truck pulls over. A man is driving the truck.

The man is covered in sweat and shit.

The man is covered in grease and oil.

The man is covered in salt and dirt.

The man is covered in gasoline and tar.

The man is covered in smoke.

The man is covered in the dead.

The man driving the truck, drives away.

All of them have left.

Only the cars are left.

Only the people are left.

Only the people and only the cars are left.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

The cars are leaving. As smoke is rising, in the air.

In the air, and then the sea.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

The bodies are covered in smoke.

The smell of burnt bodies.

The smell of burning corpses.

The smell of burning bones.

The bodies are getting thinner.

The bodies are disappearing.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

The body is disappearing. As smoke is rising, in the air.

A car driving by the road.

The blood and grease on the asphalt.

On the hood and tires.

The water covers the street.

The bodies covered with water.

As bodies are covered with water.

The smoke covers the people.

The smoke covers them.

Black smoke and black water.

Smoke covers the street.

Smoke covers the street.

The smoke is going up and up.

As water is rising, in the air.

As water is going down, in the air.

Smoke and smoke is rising.

As smoke is rising, in the air.

As water is rising, in the air.

As smoke is going down, in the air.

As smoke is gone, in the air.

As water is going up, in the air.

As black water is coming down, in the air.

The black water is going up.

The black water is going down.

The black water is disappearing.

The black water is coming down.

Black water and black smoke.

Smoke and smoke is going up.

As water is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

As the body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.

The body is disappearing, in the air.
