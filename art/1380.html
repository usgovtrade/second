We’re not just saying that because it’s a line from one of our favorite movies. Because it’s true. We are so lucky to be alive and breathing, and we’re so proud of our son. When people say “you look so good” and “it’s so nice to see you”, well, they’re absolutely right.

I can’t imagine not spending every single day with him. He’s the wind beneath our wings, the reason our hearts beat so hard. We’ve gotten so much joy out of watching him be as close to perfect as he can be, as close to the little boy we fell in love with as he can get. And of course, we wouldn’t change one bit of it. We are so lucky to have him, to have the relationship we have with him.

So yeah, if it all meant never having more children because we wanted to make this an intentional pregnancy, we’d choose that in a heartbeat. Even if it means not getting pregnant at all for another eight years, we’d choose not to try to make another baby because we love our family. Of course we wouldn’t. We wouldn’t choose to lose our son if it meant losing him for good.

But it won’t. Not for a very long time, anyway. Not if we try to space them out and not so much time passes between the next two. And really, he could just as easily be our last as he could be our first.

I know our story isn’t typical, and neither is our decision. But for us, this has been the best choice. I’m not saying other people can’t choose differently. Maybe they can. Maybe you can, too.

All I ask is that you keep this in mind: no matter what choice you make, there’s absolutely no right or wrong decision. You’ll get a lot of opinions on that.

But the truth is, there are no right or wrong decisions when it comes to the value of a human life. That’s up to you to decide. And the same goes for your reproductive decisions.

What do you do, when you can’t decide?

I don’t have an answer for you. The most I can give you is my husband’s perspective: when we don’t have a strong opinion, but don’t know what else to do, we leave it up to God. If we can’t figure out how to do it better than he can, we trust in him to guide us and make the right decision. I don’t think we’ll ever regret it. But if I was honest, I don’t even know why I came up with the words I did in this article. It’s probably because I don’t want to see myself as choosing between an opinion and a child.

Of course, some people think we are. I think that’s unfair and ignorant. I wish more people could have a mind like ours, and that you wouldn’t get judged for not being able to decide.

So I’m going to call on God in this article, because I think he can give you the right perspective. And it’s God I’m praying for, who I hope can help people see things from both sides.

To the moms out there: if your son asks you if he’s a boy or a girl, what are you going to tell him?

About Cate Martel

I'm the main writer at CateMartel.com, which is one of the oldest lifestyle blogs in the world. I get daily inspiration and enjoyment from being a mom to boys, trying to get it right and keep it together, and living life to the fullest. I'm currently working on publishing my second book. I believe the words we use in a very important, so let's get them right.

Aww, that’s so sweet. I know it’s not popular, but our choice was intentional pregnancy since we wanted to be able to choose the right donor (who we now love dearly) instead of a random “father”

I get the “what if you never have another child?” comments. And I just have to say we have loved every minute of it! The boys have the deepest connection with each other and the other kids in our lives that I’ve never seen before.

And when people say, “you’re so lucky” I feel like they’re telling me I should thank God for being so happy!

The thing is that I’m not sure I would have had this feeling about my choice if I had had a child that didn’t live. So I’d like to think that it’s me that’s not made the right choice. Even though I love my son so much and he’s the most precious thing, he did not need me to be a mother and could have been just fine without me. That makes it a little bit harder, no?
