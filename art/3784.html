Well, you get what you pay for and all that. They probably already know this,
so don't expect them to offer to tell you about things you don't need to know
about.

Oh please, it's just their website, no need to be so rude and cynical.

~~~
dccoolgai
"Cynical" in what way? I didn't mean to offend - and I'm not even sure that
was my "tone", just that the only people that need to be cynical here is you.
The site is not really that useful.

~~~
tomp
To me it was sarcasm/sass, just like it was for "just do it" (in other words,
if you can do it yourself, why pay them?).

dccoolgai
I took it as snark. It's possible to be both helpful _and_ curt (and still
behave well) in the same statement, and that's why I got out of HN for awhile.

1\. A sales funnel is a sales funnel is a sales funnel. A new website isn't.
That being said, there are plenty of examples of websites that facilitate
selling: [https://www.crayon.co/blog/design-websites-that-sell-more-
vi...](https://www.crayon.co/blog/design-websites-that-sell-more-
visitors/), [https://uxmovement.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-web-
site...](https://uxmovement.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-web-
site/)....and your new domain is more likely to be on a list of sites like
that than not.

2\. You're not paying for their advice or feedback, you're paying to save time
because it's your first sale. If you aren't going to get help finding your
first customer...it's going to be harder. Of course, maybe that is true in
general.

3\. You can get good advice online. And it's even better if you already know
the answer to the question "What do you need help with?" and it's not that
hard to find. There's some common sense involved: "If it is hard to find a
solution online, Google won't give it to you" and "I'll always remember better
than a salesperson. The salespeople always remember that I never called back."

Good luck.

Yes. It's very important for a website to have a clear target customer
audience. If the audience is ambiguous, then it's going to take forever to
find out. Once you have some traction, then you can start optimizing for them.

I'd say don't do some things:

1\. Beware of trying to make everything into a product (and having a
competitive advantage). Unless you have real demand and sales, it doesn't
matter to the user if you have 10 options. For a few cases, it's good if you
do, but for the most part, it's not.

2\. Focus on something they all have in common. As in something they can all
get. People hate it when you try to sell them something they don't want and
can't get. Also look at what they like. Does someone like a product that can
do XYZ? If yes, that's the audience. If not, make it custom-made.

3\. Use something easy to use. A lot of things are hard to make, but there are
very few that are really hard to use. Make something with Google. Something
easy and quick. You can always make a better one later.

Also, avoid creating products before there is a problem. The worst business
are products that aim to solve problems for people who don't yet have them.

An example would be an app that does facial recognition. There are other apps
that do facial recognition, but this one focuses on babies or kids, and uses
facial recognition to make little faces on a computer. Good idea? No. Better?
Yes.

You should pay attention to everything from the website but also your current
situation. As a general advice, the following points will help you:

1\. If you are already a consultant who charges from $100-200 per hour, then
there is not much point in talking about marketing since you probably don't
need it. At this stage, you have built a good reputation and may even have a
good number of regular customers already.

2\. Are you just starting out? I am not saying to spend $100-$200 on
advertising but if you want to reach out to more prospects, it will take time
but at the same time, you need to invest in marketing because it is one of the
key factors in getting sales. A/B test different marketing strategies.

3\. If you are still a newbie who has not started yet, you can do some
research on the web and also on Linkedin to find out different strategies and
tactics. In fact, if you are not at all familiar with marketing, I would read
some books on marketing if you want to learn. Yes, there are tons of resources
on the web.

> are you just starting out?

In this case i would go with: "I'm a little worried about marketing my brand"

~~~
codegeek
"I'm a little worried about marketing my brand" is a concern which can be
overcome with some research and some hard work. I would say you should get
started right away and figure out how you can increase revenue. Not doing
anything is no solution.

Check the comments. I think the thread has addressed some of your concerns.
The answer is it depends.

I have seen clients spend $2k per month in AdWords, Facebook and other
advertising and the campaign was so low that the ads didn't run long enough to
conclude what would have made a significant difference for them.

The key is to go where your customers are and in some cases that means spending
a little extra to have a more sophisticated, targeted message.

The bottom line is you won't know if you don't try.

tobltobs
Thanks for your reply. What I found so interesting about the whole situation
was that he was a long time customer with very good rating but somehow he
thought that his competitor had way better website and he even wanted to get
rid of that competitor's web site.

I have read the comments but not all of them so forgive me if I missed
something.

This is a hard question to answer. I'd look at your competitors and see where
you can find success. You can also look at the success of a competitor to see
where your weaknesses are. You want to be sure you are doing something good and
that your competitors are too, if not better.

What do you think is right? Does that help?
