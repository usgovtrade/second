I wonder what the app will be like? That might be interesting. Maybe it
doesn't have to be one of those simple games or stories but more like a
PowerPoint presentation like where all the images are on the screen instead of
scrolling left and right to be viewed. I bet I could make a $2.99 one if I put
a lot of work into it.

What apps are you using in the example? Looks like a pretty decent game.

This appears to be a play at Google's (previously) failed $9.99/year fee-
subscription app market: playstore.com/i/publishing_agreement.html#policies
(though it uses a different name for their "app promotion service"):

    
    
        "Google agrees not to display third-party ad-sponsored
        app listings in the Google Play store unless the publisher
        has implemented the Google Play developer API. In the
        event the publisher chooses to implement this service,
        Google will notify you that you should re-review your app
        and implement this service if it is in compliance with
        the Google Play developer API. This restriction applies to
        any paid app and any free app, whether in-app or full-screen
        ad."
    
    

Looks to be an interesting angle at least, allowing Google to advertise _your_
apps, or at least get a cut of any sales.

I'm not sure I understand what this is. Is this an ad in play store or a way
for publishers to distribute apps for free? (assuming its related to in app
billing) I'm very interested in knowing what it is and more information will
be appreciated. Also it's a shame there is no info about this on play store

This is, I think, something like in-app billing on iOS. It is a way for
publishers to distribute apps for free. For this reason, you'll see many of
the very best apps on Google Play, like Google's core apps, are free on
Android, while they might cost $1.99 on the iOS app store.

Interesting idea, though I suspect that the apps that could be created with
this may not be what most are after.

From the article: "It's a free service for developers who have already signed
up to the Google Play developer program."

Saying what apps will be popular and what will not be popular is well, well
beyond my guesses and most would not be good enough to justify the $3 I feel.

If you had the apps you wanted you'd be more interested than something that
can be hacked together in 3 hours.

At the bottom there is the usual "you must agree" link and they are asking for
your feedback, which suggests you just agree to them being able to have a
chance at this and nothing more. You don't have to give away the keys to the
kingdom, no. Not even with this.

What about the price point? Is that not a little steep for me to test it out?

~~~
kennywinker
I asked this same question and got this response: "Since every project is a
little different, the fee will depend on what we need to do to take care of
your project's needs. There's no way for us to know until we get to it.
Pricing is one of those things that we'll have to get used to."

~~~
chdir
Thanks for the reply. The price point might be a deal breaker for me. I
generally buy the apps that are under $5, my threshold for in-app-billing
based apps is a few dollars. The app store for android also has a ton of free
apps that cost me a few dollars every year because I read so much in a
holiday.

~~~
kennywinker
You should definitely pay the $3 to be able to play with it to see if it works
well for you or not. If it is something you'd like to try out, you can always
just buy the app and put it in the play store yourself. Not sure I get the
concern about price point though.

I'm curious to see how they can do this. So far the only way I know to do it,
is to use an auction, or perhaps have a subscription like Spotify. I wonder if
Google will allow subscriptions.

Looks like a very interesting approach. I'm guessing the developer has to
agree to giving google access to his app? (I just clicked, nothing is
happening yet.)

I'm concerned that this means they get "you" from the developer's point of
view. This would be a problem for me personally, but I have no idea how
serious. I'm guessing they might not mean it to be a problem for the majority
of developers.

~~~
kennywinker
I also asked about this, and this is the reply I got: "This isn't a problem,
our goal is to deliver a better experience for developers, we're just looking
for a small subset of apps with a great potential for success. You'll see
these apps displayed on the play store. You won't be charged for the app
itself, you'll simply see an ad for the app. We have worked with dozens of
apps on Android and Android is still the number 1 mobile platform. We are
pretty sure that we know how to make our platform better."

I find it funny that Google's answer to Apple's 30% is a 10% revenue share for
publishers. Interesting move.

This is too dangerous. Google already has the power to sell our search results,
and this would be another way to build a market share and get more people
addicted to their ads. I am more worried about these than Apple's 30%..

~~~
kennywinker
I asked about this as well and got this: "The fact that Google Play is the #1
platform with over 500,000 apps says a lot to us about the value Google Play
developers bring to Google. The Google Play team has an excellent track record
of creating high-quality and innovative apps with their best in-app offerings.
We're trying to get in front of those who are already successful and provide
them with an additional option to monetize their apps.

In fact, while trying to get in front of our valued developers, we noticed a
lot of good quality free apps on Android, but not enough free apps with in-app
billing so our users could try them out for free. That's what inspired us to
develop this new approach for helping developers monetize their apps. We're
hoping to find a few developers we think have a great idea with their apps,
who we can add to our developer program in return for an ad."

There will be a small app that will say buy the app for $9.99 for $9.99 and
then every 20 minutes you will get a picture that you will have to push back
into the black hole to make you feel good while being a whore for all the
other apps.

I don't trust google or apple with this and I refuse to join in so I refuse to
buy anything from them.

Apple wants to sell your digital soul. And with the amount of data apple has
on you, your entire digital life can be recreated and sold to anyone who will
pay. The black market is too good for them not to do this.

What? How do you interpret that?

What do you think blackmail means? Apple is an all seeing, all hearing entity.
I have no incentive to install them on my system, and I won't.

You can't make a buck unless I buy it from you. Apple knows this and wants my
secrets because they can profit off me by sharing them. Apple even wants to
know where I am so they can send me advertisements about my most recent
