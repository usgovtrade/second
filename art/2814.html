In addition to traditional ground and orbit-based sensors, a number of airborne solutions exist for mapping. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly common, and can be used to obtain the large amount of data necessary for imagery analysis, though the size and expense of these vehicles limit their use in most civilian applications. Such solutions utilize low resolution images.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an interim UAV safety report for the public that examines the various UAV platforms available in North America, their capabilities and limitations, and summarizes applicable Federal Aviation Administration rules. The full report is available at http://www.faa.gov/other_visit/uas/uas_interim.pdf. As of Jun. 8, 2008, the FAA reports that over 35 companies had registered with the FAA to test UAVs for commercial use and over 2000 UAVs were estimated to be in use in North America.
There is significant interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”), also commonly referred to as Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”). While such aircraft do not navigate on their own, they are remote controlled or tele-operated by a pilot who is typically located at a ground control station (“GCS”). Using the GCS, the pilot sends control commands to the UAV via a communication link. The UAV processes the commands and reacts accordingly. For example, commands from the pilot can be used to change the orientation of the UAV in three dimensions, adjust the speed of the UAV, change the heading of the UAV, and to activate various payloads (e.g., cameras, sensors, communications equipment, etc.). Many UAV systems also include inertial navigation systems to allow the UAV to move in a planned fashion.
Using conventional data processing techniques to construct a map of an area from the raw data collected by a UAV system is extremely time consuming. Even for a fixed wing UAV flying at a fixed altitude, such mapping procedures can take several hours for just a few percent of the total area to be mapped. If the altitude of the UAV is varied, the amount of data collected over time increases exponentially, making the mapping task unmanageable. In addition, using a traditional data processing system to process and store the images collected by the UAV is very time consuming. As a result, such mapping processes can be very time consuming and/or cost prohibitive.
Because of the limitations associated with mapping using UAV systems, efforts have been made to utilize a low resolution satellite image with the data obtained by the UAV. However, it is very difficult to properly align the two datasets because the positions of the images are determined from different sources and a time-consuming alignment process is required. This alignment process can include manual identification and registration of landmarks that are visible in both datasets.
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide techniques for building a map of an area using the data collected by a UAV system without the aforementioned drawbacks. It is also desirable to provide methods, systems, and computer program products for collecting image data with a UAV system that is combined with data from other data sources, such as satellite data, to provide a high-resolution map of an area. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:42
