our customers to the next technological level in order to reach the objectives 
of our  corporate customers.   The IT systems that support the critical 
application systems for trading gas and power on the continental US are 
reaching the end of their useful lives.  We need to architect, design, 
develop and implement robust, efficient, reliable, and secure systems 
infrastructure to support these application systems.  We have recently 
initiated a number of significant projects in this area.

These new systems will use the same gas and power trading applications that 
are in place today, including mid and back office systems for gas and power, 
physical commodity trading applications, deal capture, deal management, 
confirmations, and settlements.  The new systems will support a wide range of 
weapons, such as trading floors, web-based  applications, electronic 
commissions via the Internet, private or secure networks, and more. 

I am pleased to announce that Eric Gonzales will lead a technology project 
for this group.  Eric will report directly to me and will work closely with 
all of the project team members and Earl Chanley, project manager.   We 
expect all systems for the continental US to be in place for July 1. 
Applications for international locations will require more time to deliver. 
We will continue to work on international projects during the first half of 
the year and intend to deliver the first international locations by year end.

Over the past months, we have initiated several large, long-term 
infrastructure projects for the gas and power trading floors.   As you know, 
infrastructure projects of this nature require a tremendous amount of work 
and detailed planning.   We will continue to plan and execute these 
infrastructure projects during the first half of the year while continuing to 
support current business.

Please call me if you have any questions.   Thanks.
