pondering how much people suck, check out the Dashing, a CSS library to make
sites that look like web 1.0. (I would, but all the fun stuff is behind a

So in this piece, "The new web" and "The Next Wave" are both defined by "The
Next Web," according to the author. So there's a set of tools and ideas
represented by "The Next Web" and some that are not. It would be clearer if
the author said "We are excited about" The Next Web as defined by The New Web.

Otherwise, I thought it was an interesting piece because of how the author
goes out and talks to people using the things he's excited about and getting
their insights. This was, for example, how I learned about Webtrends, which is
totally obscure to me. I'm sure many other people will pick up on tools that
are mentioned here that they'd like to use but haven't yet heard of.

I think the problem with Google being closed off to new technologies is they
don't even have the same people on staff anymore, and even the ones who were
there are very much 'that's not how Google works'.

We need to be encouraging the kinds of attitudes needed to make Google
something we can learn from rather than the opposite.

I think the problem is less about what the old ways of building the web are,
and more about what the new ways of building the web are.

Web development is still in a state of flux, at least as a profession. Many of
the problems we face can be solved by new technology and approaches. To say
nothing of the fact that the same web infrastructure has only existed for
decades, meaning there's plenty of opportunity for more changes.

The difference is that now, not only are there different tools and approaches,
there are multiple developers doing everything from a perspective that is
unique to their experience. Now we need more than a designer and a coder --
there's front-end developers, back-end developers, project managers, content
managers, sales, engineering and so forth.

The point of the article was around the concept of "The New Web." It's not
specific to any one vendor or technology, but simply the attitude of learning
the new ways of developing. To say nothing of understanding that the web is an
application delivery system -- not a design or content delivery platform. It's
not about tools -- it's about the approach and mindset.

I wish that article was as good as your description here. I would have loved
to see it.

I'm glad that Google is building new tools for building new software. Google
should keep looking for new tools and try new things, even if they aren't
obvious right now.

"Google is the biggest company on the Internet". What is the point? Please.
(Actually, its a terrible article in its own right.)

santoshmaharshi
A very nicely written article, especially for a company like Google, having
many projects going on.

I think in many ways Google wants to become a great company just like any
other companies in the web arena.

Great to see them trying out so many new stuff and sharing the experiences.

Why does anyone pay attention to an article with no clear agenda or content?
That is, this article is as relevant as an unread tweet.

jordanmessina
Perhaps they just wanted to write an essay that had no agenda other than "this
is what I think" rather than just a headline piece with no explanation as to
why it was interesting or important.

"The New Web" = Google Plus

The author needs to read a bit more.

robotmay
I would love to, but I can't spend every evening reading a whole load of Google
Plus articles and news articles.

Good article! I think that Google should focus on making developer's life easier
- just like Apple does.

I like how this kind of article always makes a bunch of people cry, but I don't
see what's wrong with it. If you disagree with it, you'll find something else
to bitch about.

The way to be a better member of the community is to not go around preaching
exactly how to do better. It's better to be a part of the solution.

EugeneOZ
Don't miss a good chance to blame them about something. In this case they are
better not to be the best - it's always better to be the second best. They
have enough time for this, they don't need any publicity.

Not all of the "New Web" is open or interesting.

Can someone tell me why Hulu is in the examples? I have no interest in a video
company that requires a login from my ISP to view content.

It also makes me doubt that it's an example of The New Web.

------
hugorodgerbrown
It's very hard to know what the author means when they use the phrase "we
want".

I am not sure if that makes sense of I make sense?

And the "new web" is just the one we talked about in mid-2009 -- the semantic-
web. We're still a long way from a semantic web "web", and maybe not in your
lifetime.

That's a whole 'nother article, or indeed an encyclopaedia in itself.

I have to agree with his points about why free is good.

Well, yes. The only thing that was missing was how Google has an inferiority
complex. Or was it just self-promotion?

~~~
s_kilk
You should read the rest of the article, there's a fair bit of self-promotion,
but its not in the least bit "inferior".

The article says Google tries to focus on a thing for a long time. This is a
reasonable strategy. It means their tools and products are highly polished and
well-thought-out. It also means there's a fair amount of inertia behind them,
so even when Google does change direction, they can do so with a great degree
of confidence.

In my opinion that's a good thing. It's not "inferior", just one of the many
ways one company can take the lead in the market.

You lost me at "open" and "free". I'm sorry but as soon as people start talking
about that we're entering the realm of buzzwords.

~~~
icebraining
It's not buzzwords, it's reality. How many times have you wanted to share
something with someone only to find that the only way to share it is through a
walled garden? How many times has Google been unable to help you with it?

Kiro
I can go on but I don't want to give this guy any attention.
