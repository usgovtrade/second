About Me

As a playwright, I enjoy using story to help better the audience. I use everything from clowns to fairy tales and classical pieces to tell stories for the stage.
When I'm not writing, I enjoy reading. Sci-fi and all things nerd/nerdy are my favorite genre, and I try to find something to read in all genres. My dad introduced me to Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels and it's a love I have never grown out of. My husband and I are working on finding something that fits me and I know I'll love as much as Dirk.
My biggest hobby is watching movies/TV series. I can't say it is better than reading but it's more likely to be a guilty pleasure as I can have a bunch of different series going on at once. Right now I'm into Vikings, which is as good as it sounds, and The Tudors. I also watch Archer and The Flash. We recently got into Agent Carter but it was a bit of an anti-climax as it seems the second season will be a set up for something that is not Agent Carter.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:18
