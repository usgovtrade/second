After all the years of performing the role, the only part of the original production for which he's still remembered is "The Lonely Goatherd."

To most, the 1965 film, directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews, is more synonymous with _The Sound of Music_ than the original production. With nearly all of the original cast members reprising their roles, _The Sound of Music_ becomes a big-screen phenomenon that endures beyond its initial theatrical run, a phenomenon that has spanned countless television productions and three live versions, most recently in 2013.

The _Sound of Music_ phenomenon has not been without its ups and downs, most notably when the film was released without final edited credits. That wasn't the only time the final credits were missing. The final credits did not appear in the film until November 1, 1964, which was a full two months after the final film had first premiered. After that was corrected, the credit for writing was originally awarded to a group that included Dorothy Fields and Harry Warren. The credit was later changed to the sole writer, Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, but _Variety_ reports that they were not credited until January 1966.

With such an extraordinary and unexpected success, some have wondered why Rodgers and Hammerstein never approached Julie Andrews again. The two did have one encounter after _The Sound of Music_ to discuss a new project, but it never came to fruition. In a 2009 interview with the _Daily Mail_ , Rodgers recalled that he and Andrews met at the Playwrights' Company in New York City to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new musical. Although Rodgers liked the idea and thought they could produce something special, he was told that Julie was already signed to do _My Fair Lady_ and would not be available. As a result, they parted ways.

On a different note, Stephen Sondheim is the only other person besides Julie Andrews to have performed in both the original Broadway production of _The Sound of Music_ and its 1965 film version.

While Julie Andrews continues to be associated with _The Sound of Music,_ the sequel, _Mary Poppins,_ is as synonymous with Julie Andrews as _The Sound of Music_ is with Audrey Hepburn.

With its star having left the musical, _The Sound of Music_ limped along for two months before closing its doors on March 7, 1966. A year later, Julie Andrews stepped out in a movie adaptation of her first best-selling book. _The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_ had been written and produced by Terence Rattigan, a Tony Award winner for Best Play who died on the same day that he was awarded the honor. _Brooklyn,_ adapted by Ketti Frings from Betty Smith's autobiographical novel, followed soon after.

Over the next few years, Julie Andrews reprised her role in several TV films including _The Girl Most Likely to..., My Fair Lady and Nunsense._

_The Sound of Music_ has maintained an active tradition and has launched many careers. It has not only launched a film career for Julie Andrews but also launched a new career for her husband, Blake Edwards. Edwards went on to direct some of Julie Andrews' greatest films, including _The Pink Panther,_ which received its own "Sound of Music" treatment in the 1968 film _The Return of the Pink Panther_ which served as the final film appearance of Peter Sellers.

_The Sound of Music_ 's effect on Julie Andrews' career continues to be felt today. Like the film that launched her career, it catapulted her into a series of successful, groundbreaking roles, including her breakout role as Sandy Olsen in _Mary Poppins_ and Mrs. Doubtfire.
