(Or the Flavor)", a song recorded by The Flavor of Love All Star Challenge winners for Da Brat's The Real CoCo album.

The song was used in two episodes of the Showtime comedy series Weeds. One, in the season 1 episode "The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened" and the season 4 episode "A New Chapter".

The album was also used as background music for a V8 television commercial for the 2006 Toyota Camry.

Composition 
Dru Hill told Rap-Up magazine that "I feel it's a very R&B song. I knew they were going to give it a R&B beat.". "I can put [it on] a pop record if I want to, but this one just feels more soulful and more R&B."

Commercial performance 
The single peaked at #23 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart, spending 10 weeks on the chart.
