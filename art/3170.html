The Group has continued to grow by leveraging its expertise in online entertainment, including the launch of SGCC Internet Casino, the world's first "social casino" where players can connect and socialize with their favorite gaming characters. Along with the Group's expansion into new markets, and the growth of its retail presence, the Group continues to evolve its value proposition and brand image.

With its growing social gaming communities, SGCC is preparing for its future beyond social media. In April 2016, it launched the "Game with SGCC" campaign and a new mobile application to enable more convenient playing opportunities and encourage brand engagement. In addition, SGCC joined "SAP-JIMA â€“ The Innovation Partnership", a Japan Initiative on Mobile Application Promotion, to launch its first social casino "SHARE."
