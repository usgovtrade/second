purchase gas from the Houston Navigator terminal.  What is important for 
this ECS deal is that we intend to have a long-term price fixed at a specific 
Denver Index and that a gas flow agreement will be in place between these two 
counterparties which will enable us to flow supply to ECS as long as we can 
agree on the pricing and terms in that long-term contract.  We have already 
received a copy of that confirmation.

In the next few weeks, we will draft a GISB to cover the transactions and will 
forward it to you.  We will also supply you with copies of our confirmation.  
When all parties have agreed on a contract and ECS has paid the reservation 
fee (as I understand it, this is approximately $3,500) the GISB will be 
forwarded for execution.  

We will need to complete a master agreement for those customers that wish to 
enter into interruptible deals.  This form of master is the first one I sent 
to you.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.  I can be 
reached at 713-853-3512 and will be on vacation the remainder of this week.

Thanks.

The following payback was done today for TW Compression Services deals:

12/99 - $51,982.53 for Phillips Production
10/99 - $73,507.26 for Phillips Production

Netback:

12/99 - $38,518.14
10/99 - $59,211.68

Gross:

12/99 - $73,507.26
10/99 - $73,507.26

Note:  I changed the 10/99 payback to a gross and net.  Previously it was 
posted as a net only.  The net back to ENA was posted to TP2 on TCO because 
the transport was not available.  

TK said to increase the payback on the 9/99 deal from $4,960 to $9,240.

Audrey, please try to tie down these 3 deals to post February accruals, if 
possible.  Thanks.  Let me know if you have questions.

Steve Van Hooser had scheduled the TW Compression Payback for today, but 
with TW's loss of receivables, the TW Compression Payback number changes.  
So, I need to update you on this.  

Two deals were done on TW Compression Services for Sep-00 and one for Oct-00.  
These are Phillips Production Services deals and there is no actual income 
from them yet, so Steve will pay them back to TW.  Steve will let us know the 
exact amount later this afternoon.  TW will then pay Phillips and they will 
be in the hole.  I'm working with Michelle, Audrey, Lorraine and Julia on 
these deals.  They will probably not be done until Thursday.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please let me know.  Thanks.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:50
