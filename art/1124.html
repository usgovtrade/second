When you’re buying your first home, the price, location and condition of the property are all critical considerations. Here’s what you need to know before you make your purchase.
Commercial transactions are governed by state and local laws and must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Some things you should know if you are considering a commercial transaction:
Commercial purchases may include leases with option to buy, which is more flexible than a hard purchase agreement;
Commercial purchases may include an operating partner that is a qualified individual but not necessarily the owner;
A commercial purchase often involves the consideration of fixtures, equipment, furnishings and building enhancements;
A commercial buyer is likely to require an appraisal or due diligence;
The purchase contract will typically include a right of first refusal that allows the seller an opportunity to first speak with any potential buyers who have expressed interest in acquiring the property.
Our Real Estate team will help you prepare your business for the sale or financing of your real estate. Whether you are a business owner or real estate professional, we can ensure your assets are adequately protected through negotiation and by structuring the transaction in a manner that is consistent with your long-term business plan.
If you would like to discuss any of these topics with one of our experienced attorneys, please contact us.

It's important to be a part of your community, so many people here helped me through difficult times.
The more involved and supportive you are, the more support you will receive. If you want to help someone, you just need to ask and they'll let you know how to do it. It's good to have an online "support system" when people are always there to answer questions and give advice; for example, I found an amazing support group on Facebook for pregnant women with PPD that helped a lot. So many people have been there themselves and shared their stories; sharing is one of the best things about DS.
The longer you stay on DS, the more friends you'll make. (Well, they do say friendship multiplies like pooh!)
I agree with the above post: This is a group where support can be found. You might not always find immediate help but having a place to turn is priceless...
I also agree that if you are suffering from depression, anxiety, or panic attacks and have nowhere to turn, DS is a great resource.

Museum of the Jewish People – is a huge complex with exhibition halls, an extensive library and even an audio-visual room dedicated to the Holocaust. The museum also offers a selection of guided tours.
Jerusalem Archaeological Park – is where you can find the City of David, which sits above the Western Wall. The park has some excellent archaeological excavations that you should definitely explore while in Israel.
The Western Wall, or Kotel, is one of the most significant places in Judaism. This wall, a remnant from the Second Temple period is today revered as a place of prayer.
The Garden Tomb is another significant religious site in Jerusalem. For those interested in visiting this place, you can join a tour with Via Dolorosa who are based in Jerusalem.
The Tower of David Museum – is dedicated to Jerusalem’s history and it’s full of artefacts and exhibitions highlighting different periods of its history.
Jaffa Port is one of Israel’s oldest ports, which now stands as a working port. You can check out the excavated Roman harbour, watch a cruise ship leave the port or even buy some fresh fish from the market stalls.
Mitzpe Ramon is an interesting town surrounded by stunning natural beauty. You can take a drive through one of the most accessible national parks in Israel, find out more about Mitzpe Ramon’s fascinating geology or head over to the nearby caves of Eshel Ben Ezra.
Hammamat-Ghanem is an ancient village with striking Crusader-era architecture. Some of the most important archaeological discoveries made in Israel were found here in a Crusader Castle and an Ottoman Villa.

The last post is a discussion from a Mom whose child developed DS just 4 months after a high-risk pregnancy. Here are excerpts:
My daughter came 2 weeks after they gave us the worst news. However, I knew deep down that she would be a miracle...
We've had our share of problems since the beginning. We were prepared to accept her developmental delays, but because of her other issues, it's been hard on us and my husband.
She is now nearly 7. She was 3 months old when we got the official diagnosis; she was diagnosed with PDD-NOS [pervasive development disorder - not otherwise specified] when she was about 2.
The challenges for us came from the lack of knowledge from many professionals, the doctors who didn't seem to listen to us and who didn't follow through with referrals. It took us over two years just to get a sensory assessment so that they could give us an effective OT treatment plan...
We had the same issue with an Occupational Therapist who didn't know much about DS. It took awhile for them to work together... I think that most of the time, therapists have not been given a lot of</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:29
