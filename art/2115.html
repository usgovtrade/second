For people who like to be heard, The Power of One! is the program for you. Each one hour episode gives you up to one minute for yourself to say anything that comes to your mind and is important to you, like how you feel about certain topics, or how you see your life unfolding.

You can use the time to speak out about what’s on your mind, talk about yourself, or speak about an issue that’s important to you.

How to Play: Tune in to The Power of One! at 5:00 p.m. each weekday, and find out when the next episode is. Set your recorder to one minute and say whatever is on your mind during that time. It can be your voice or a script, but you have to read something.

When you want to play your voice, just hold down the record button until the counter hits a one.

Then, make sure the mic volume is turned up really loud. (Turn the microphone back down when you’re done.) And make sure you are facing the camera and have your head in the frame.
