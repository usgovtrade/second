Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you!

I can't believe I didn't think about that. I have to tell you that on a
serious note the last few months have been very difficult for me.  Just
before Christmas I found out I was pregnant with Austin.  I can't believe
I
am adding another child to this family at this point.  I just really feel
overwhelmed and stupid.  I am thinking about going back to work after
Lacrosse.  Can you imagine me in the office now after this baby?  Don't
know
if I am ready for that yet.  I have been thinking a lot about our last
talk
and how much has happened since then. I feel bad about how things ended. 
I
just hope I still feel the same way when you come back. I love you and
look
forward to getting to know you better. 

Tiffany

I would think so, however Tiff has never mentioned anything about
babies, so that is good news for us.

Love you and hope to see you soon.

    What in the world were you talking about with Tiffany?  Does she have
    the
    baby or not?

    I'm sorry that you aren't coming home yet but I'm sure you will be
    coming
    home soon. I just hope that you stay safe and have a great time!

    Well since you are no longer in school now I guess you won't be needing
    a
    new bathing suit.
