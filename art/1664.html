An 8-year-old girl in New Zealand died last night, about 36 hours after she was attacked by two dogs on a farm where she’d been left in charge. Her mother told local media that she and her husband had dropped the girl off to sleep over at a farm house while they were driving back home from their wedding. They didn’t know the girl and the dogs that lived there. The dogs mauled the 8-year-old girl last night.

The mother found her body this morning.

The mother and the father and grandparents have been treated in a local hospital where they are being treated for shock.

The family said in a statement that the child was their most precious girl.

It’s not clear what caused the dogs to attack her. The dogs were taken away from the farm to be treated at a local vet, who has now said that the dogs are too dangerous to be around humans.

New Zealand police are investigating the attack. It’s unclear if the child will be publicly identified.

We think this death is one of the saddest things to happen.

This poor girl. We think she was taken care of and left with a dog she thought she knew. Instead of safe and warm, she was subjected to terror and death.

How could someone possibly watch a child die like that? How can a dog turn on a child and maul them to death. They shouldn’t have any kind of temperament like that. That child is a angel, and there will be peace in heaven now that she is no longer with us. No one deserves this, but especially not a child.

All we can do is pray for the family during this very hard time. Prayers are the only thing that will help the grieving family to get over this tragedy. We wish all the family the best. We will all be praying for the family. We want this story to get as much media as possible, just so that every person who reads this story can understand the danger of having a child around large dogs. If you have a dog, or your dog has ever shown any kind of aggressive behavior, we urge you to get rid of that animal immediately, and make sure that dog is never alone with children again.

Thank you for reading. If you’d like to send your thoughts and prayers, let us know in the comments below. We also encourage you to share this story with your friends and family if you think they will feel the same way about the 8-year-old girl’s death.

This is something you’d expect from a human. But this is not. This is a dog. A golden retriever. We have to call this what it is. A pure evil. The world lost a beautiful person with her death. We have all seen the story and the video of the woman who got mauled by a dog at a park. Now we can see that the woman actually got mauled by a pure evil.

You can see that when she’s bitten, she doesn’t want to hurt the dog, but the dog doesn’t care. It just knows what it wants and it won’t take no for an answer. The woman is in pain, bleeding, and we can only imagine the fear and terror that must have been going on in her head.

There is something evil with this woman that was killed by this dog. She seems nice and friendly, so what could have changed to have her in such a terrible state when she didn’t deserve it?

This woman deserves justice, and she deserves to be in a better place now, than to have her just lying down for people to throw a ball or toy at, and being gored by a dog. Dogs are not toys. This woman was killed because this dog didn</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:18
