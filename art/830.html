significantly increase the level of confidence in cost estimates and allow 
us 
to be much more proactive in managing our P&L.  The strategy is to link our 
signoff 
on a project and the financial stake held by that project's cost 
center.    

Here is the process:   

1) We signoff on a project or cost center (100%)
2) That cost center then becomes responsible (via "Rep" or in some cases 
"Sub-Consultant" in the project's budget) for 100% of the cost of the 
project (initially this is a manual process but soon we will have this 
automatic).

If at any time the cost center's financial stake drops to below 50% of the 
cost of 
the project, the project's budget must be reprioritized to bring the 
stake in 
that cost center back up to at least 50%.  

Why is this important?  Well,  if we are underestimating the cost of a 
project 
by 10% and we hold financial stake in the project at 50%, the project only 
costs 
us 50% of our total estimate or only half of our available budget.  If we 
underestimate 
the project by 10% again, the cost only costs us 50% of our available 
budget and 
only half of our available budget is lost.  However, if we don't have 
confidence 
that we can get the cost back up to 50%, we could lose a project for 
50%+ of our 
available budget.

This method requires a lot of discipline and a lot of communication across 
all levels 
of our organization.  Fortunately, it is simple and it provides us the 
flexibility 
to react to changes in our estimate. 
I would like us to be more proactive at getting our P&L under control and 
increasing 
our level of confidence in our overall estimates.   To do this I am asking 
each of you to 
look for ways to add this type of discipline to your teams.   I realize that 
there will 
be those of you that feel your groups are already too "aggressive" in their 
approach 
to managing their P&L.  I would ask you to review the attached presentation 
and 
to look for other opportunities to add this type of discipline.

The next time we have a "numbers" discussion with the Directors I would like 
to see this 
information included.  We will be discussing "Fall 2001" and the expectations 
of 
each group.

Thank you for your time and attention to this subject.  I look forward to 
working with 
each of you to develop "more disciplined " cost estimates for ENA.

Subject: Estimates vs. Actual for 1st Quarter 2000

In working with the Accounting Department on the allocation for January 2000 
and the payment of the A/R for January, we discovered some minor differences 
that we need your assistance in resolving.

Attached please find the allocation.   Also attached are the estimated 
payments and actual payments for January.

Based on these figures, there is a slight difference of ($161,179) between 
the Estimated Payments and Actual Payments.   The vast majority of this 
difference results from a program that was paid in January, 2001.   However, 
there is also a portion that we may not have included in our number.   The 
Accounting Dept. has indicated that they will work with us to determine if 
this is the case or if we have omitted any additional allocation.

Once we have agreed on these figures, we will forward them to Corporate for 
their final review and subsequent payment.


Thanks again for all of your help,
