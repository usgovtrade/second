companies are cutting down on their work hours. You can't really work less
and expect to get more out of it. You have to get less but expect it to pay
off in the long term. Many times this only happens if the people working less
put a lot of effort into getting the next promotion. I don't believe that is
the case with you.

What I don't understand is the lack of support you get from your manager. You
say you are a great employee and you need to be valued more. Why didn't they
provide what you needed? You have a year's worth of experience, not to mention
the expertise. I don't get why they don't give you more freedom, at least to
make them see that they have value that they need to keep around. They can't
take back what you gave them in the first year. You need to do a bit of soul
searching. Are they really offering you anything on a daily basis? Why? Did
they give you the same offers? To be honest the only reason I can think of why
they would not offer you more is that they fear you leaving. It's hard to
offer more when there's always the possibility you will leave. My advice to
you is to quit first and then see if you are able to come back and if they
are willing to give you what you need. If you quit and then come back you
would have a strong bargaining chip.

I can see it from a different perspective. You say, "I got to choose between
working 12 hours in a week or 20 hours per week." If that is the case, why
not work 20 hours? I would rather have the time than extra dollars. What do
you do in 20 hours? Sleep? I sleep 8-9 hours per day. After that I'm dead
until about 3:00 pm. I work an hour or two, then maybe do some laundry and
clean up the house. After that I read a little and do some light chores like
grocery shopping. This is my day. Is it really a waste of time? Some of it is
a waste of time, but if you spent that time more productively you would get
more done in the day and probably be more efficient. You could read more,
clean up the house more, get exercise. In all my time off I get in three to
four runs a week, go out for drinks, play tennis, play ping pong, I'll go out
for a good meal a few times. Does that not help you out of work?

Maybe they are saying to you, "Don't come back if you are just going to do
your job." For me, it's like being in a marriage. When you are dating and you
both agree on the parameters of your dating relationship, then things are
really working. When the two parties want a separation after one of the
parties wants to get the boot, it is usually time to call it quits. If you
just got into this business and you want to just do your job and not give
anything more, it is usually a good time to look around for a new job. But if
you're not going to give anything more, why should they give you more? As a
result, they don't give you more and you're a happy camper because you are
getting more for your efforts than they're willing to give you. What is the
point? Why are you putting up with this if they aren't giving you what you
need?

I agree with you that there are many companies that are having trouble. It is
the "company man" trying to convince himself that he is a professional. What
other answer can he give if the employee doesn't have high productivity?

If you did the math and the company is offering only $10 per hour, that
doesn't give you any incentive to increase your own productivity either. In
fact, you could make more money being your own boss than working for someone
else. You could become more efficient. I can guarantee you one thing, if you
try working for a high paying company and put the effort into working less and
seeing more return on your efforts, they will see this and try to negotiate
this same thing. They want to be more efficient than you. I believe there
will be companies that pay more for this skill set than just working for a
company.

In the end, everyone knows you can't work 10 hour days or get to the top. If
you want to be your own boss, then you should not be looking at the 10 hour
day. You can work 10 hours a week in a company and get ahead. The only
trouble is that you need the time to increase your salary. This is something
I'm sure you're not used to. I would suggest if you want to be valued more,
then you should go out and get a new job. If you don't, then it looks like the
company doesn't value you much at all. They are not offering you much. The
salary you asked for seems low, but I would say if you are one of the great
programmers, then you could easily find companies that pay $30 - $40 per hour.
That's the value you can get from it. I would not pay $20 per hour for the
same work that I pay someone $25 - $30 per hour. I would not pay $10 - $15 per
hour for what I pay a high school graduate to work.

I would want to make sure that if I am someone with this many skills, I would
be offered more than just a salary. It doesn't matter if I get it in cash or
stock or options. I would want a real part of the business if they will let
me make more money on a share basis. I would be a real partner, get to make
projections, participate in the business, and know the company is doing well.
You can't get all of that in a 10 hour day.

Good luck to you.

I think you need to understand your worth ... and put it up for negotiation.

I think it is unwise to go from a company where you are among the very best,
to another where you are just average. In fact, I think you should look for
something that suits your skills and put in more effort there, but find a
better negotiating position. I'd ask for more money, and find other aspects of
my job - which I like - that I can negotiate to enhance my work life. Your
life. Make sure you include more than just salary.

When I was at Google, everyone knew to take me for lunch, a beer, or coffee -
in lieu of a Christmas bonus, etc. Everyone knew my role, and I was recognized
every day in meetings. Not all companies have such culture ... and I doubt
it's really that unusual to work for companies with this environment, but
somehow in the last 30 years of working in large software projects, this has
almost become a new reality for the software industry ... and I wonder if it
should be.

My point is that if you are in a new high tech, dynamic, highly competitive
job at a software company, you should leverage it - you are already there -
you just need to change the way you play your cards.

I don't know, it's always easy to say "give more", but how much should I give?
Where should I even start?

A large salary and a high bonus isn't everything. There are other benefits I
like, like how much do you really want? Money is not the only thing that
matters, I'd say.

Anyway, the real problem is "why would they let me go, if they know how
valuable I am?". It's no a matter of "work more", I mean, if they really need
a dev for that company, they can't have a policy that will limit their
productivity.

Well, they need someone at least as good as you for your position, but I think
it's a valid question. You already have some evidence for your worth in the
past, now you just need to start leveraging it.

In terms of negotiating, I am a big fan of the book "How to be a
Successful...[insert career]" where the author has a chapter specifically for
"salary negotiation". He does not give direct answers, but suggests that you
think like a "player" when doing negotiations.

To leverage your existing situation, don't just negotiate your salary - also
try negotiating other aspects of your job. For example, you should try to
negotiate into your vacation time for more days off. Negotiate into your
commute time for parking close to work. Negotiate into your training days for
more training, etc.

In any case, there are good software engineers in the midwest - you need to
think about how you could use these talents.
