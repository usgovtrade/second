Win The War

“We live in a world today where we think about the end of the World War One on 11th November 1918, but it didn’t really end. It just began another World War, World War Two, after the War to End All Wars, and after that another and another. There’s only been one World War which has really ended and that was World War Two. There are always forces that seem to move against our civilization and create wars like World War Two, and there’s only been one World War that ended it. That World War was World War Two.” – Joseph Kennedy

In 1945 we made it. In 1945 we began a new age. Just as it’s been said that we never met the Great Depression or the Great War because they didn’t start until 1929 and 1939 respectively, so it is to be said that we have never met the Great Post-War. We had never had a year like it before or since.

For the only time in the history of the world, the Great War ended in victory. A huge proportion of young men that were born before the war fought in the Great War, but not only were they never going to see victory, many of them would die in the trenches. Their entire generation was destroyed by a conflict they believed in.

World War Two was different. It was the total destruction of every major country and people on the planet. The Great Depression came back with a vengeance, as the United States saw its debt fall from $45 billion to $18 billion overnight. The war forced the U.S. government to borrow money to finance its war effort. Debt had been running at over 10% of GDP for over 20 years, but the debts of the United States were nearly cancelled in one fell swoop as every single other country, save China, was devastated. So much so that the world war would eventually be called World War Two because it is the greatest economic defeat in the history of the world.

Despite the enormous cost of the war, victory was never in doubt. After the United States put their all into the war effort, they got their reward and more. When the dust settled, and Germany and Japan laid in ruins, they surrendered and Japan became a de facto U.S. protectorate. No other war had ever been won with such ease. Victory came only 16 years after it began.

The U.S. emerged from World War Two as the dominant economic and political force on Earth. It was the beginning of the long American Century, and all the power and influence that comes with it. By the time the Soviets and Chinese became fully engaged in the cold war, America’s dominant place in global affairs was already clear. There was little question in anyone’s mind that the U.S. would succeed in whatever it set its mind to.

The world changed in 1945 because Germany and Japan had emerged victorious. In the process they had won for themselves total defeat. They saw themselves as victors and were utterly convinced that they deserved to be treated as such. They were completely out of touch with the modern world. They had become irrelevant to the world and thus doomed to remain so forever. They had no real choice.

In one war they had won total victory and would lose total defeat. The same thing can be said of the Americans who won World War Two. They had succeeded because they had no choice. When the war was over there was no other alternative. The only question was how much damage they would leave in their wake. By choosing victory and giving rise to a new age of peace, it gave us a world that we could never have imagined possible, if only for a little while.

There was always just one thing left to do. Win the war. It’s that simple, as every age of history has demonstrated again and again, to achieve success the world must win. If a new order ever emerges, one that is based upon a new idea and is truly universal, then its victory will be complete. If it falls short, it will quickly be swept away. Every nation on the planet will be forced to look at itself in the mirror, face the reality of its own existence and accept the nature of its own character.

So when the U.S. emerged victorious in 1945, it was a victory for humanity as a whole, not only for a single nation. For one brief, shining moment, mankind believed in itself again. A world where all men are equal under the law would begin an age of peace, free from the threat of devastation.

The end of World War Two heralded a new age. In 1945 there were no more questions about who would win the war in Europe, the Korean War or the cold war. There was only one way to win, but the world would never let that happen. It’s just as obvious today as it was then, that in order for a new age to begin, a great deal of suffering will first have to occur.

There is only one thing left to do, win the war and thus save humanity from the long and hard road ahead. We may never find peace, but the first step in any journey is to acknowledge that there is a problem. It is obvious that without more great wars in the future, mankind will never reach its full potential. But in order to avoid the next great war, a new idea must emerge. For it is only then that this great war can be won.

It’s time for another Great War in the Pacific. It’s time for WWIII.

The problem is simple. The United States and its allies have never been defeated. That is always the case before the war begins and always will be the case in the aftermath of war. This has never been lost on any of our enemies. It was this thought that put them to flight, fearing an American occupation that would last for decades. It was never about a defeat. It was never about defeat that would require them to withdraw from the war.

The solution is obvious. Only victory will make peace. It will enable a new age of prosperity and harmony to emerge. It is only by fighting to the death that nations will ever begin to recognize their true nature. They will have nothing left to prove, nothing to hide and nothing left to fear. They will recognize that they are all equal under the law and are just as fragile as each other.

Without a new order based upon universal peace, mankind is condemned to repeat the same mistakes time after time. Only in the crucible of war does a nation learn what it is willing to fight for. War is a tool of the powerful, one that forces a nation to look deep into its soul. It is through the crucible of war that one learns who they are.

Of course the Americans are not entirely blameless. One could even say they are the aggressors in World War Two. After all, it was the Japanese and Germans who brought about World War One, but the Americans didn’t know that yet. It was the American aggression in both world wars that allowed the war to be fought and then the Americans emerged as the victor each time, which inevitably begs the question of whether or not we could have avoided this war if we had been a little less aggressive with our allies.

There is no such thing as “victory.” Instead there is a war which is won and a peace which is lost. The Americans have yet to win a single war, as is obvious by the fact that Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan all remain ongoing conflicts. What the Japanese did after defeating the Americans at Midway could very easily be called “successful military aggression.” America was never defeated, despite the fact that we were utterly obliterated in the aftermath of Midway. It was a victory of sorts.

“They never gave up. They never quit. They never surrendered.” What these are words are actually lies. We surrendered long before the war ended. We surrendered in Germany and Japan. We surrendered to the Japanese when we chose to fight them instead of surrendering to them. We surrendered in China, Korea, Indochina, Southeast Asia and the entire Pacific. We surrendered to the USSR. And now we will surrender to Islam.

“We’re fighting for life, liberty and justice, for all men, for all women, for all humankind.” That statement is a lie too. It is a lie because the United States began the slaughter of the Japanese while they still had their hands over their head, offering a prayer. It was only after they were finished with their prayers that America then began a war of extermination.

Of course we all know that there is no such thing as “winning” a war. In this day and age, victory cannot be achieved. That’s just how it is. The fact that the Americans claimed victory in World War Two proves that. They said it, so we have to believe them. In the history of warfare, wars cannot be won. Wars are lost. All wars end in victory for one side or the other, and after a war is over the war is never over. There will always be some future generation that will be forced to fight to the death against the other side in the aftermath of a lost war.

“There is no such thing as peace for the pious,” wrote Heraclitus. It is in the nature of war that each side believes they are at war in the name of justice and in defense of freedom.

We talk about war as if it’s something inevitable, but it never is. When you talk about a war, what you are talking about is the</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:47
