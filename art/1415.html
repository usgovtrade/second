"Okay, what's "million dollar night"?" "How many times have you guys seen "million dollar night"?" "Oh, millions." "You know it's the one where this guy's a famous professional basketball player, but he owes some bookies some money." "So he plays a bunch of card games with guys for big stakes." "One night, he gets carried away and wins $50,000 playing blackjack." "So the bookies take the bet." "He ends up busting, but his date had switched his marked deck with a hidden deck." "See, he was playing with the house's deck all along." "And she waltzes off with the entire jackpot." "What do you want from me?" "It was more complicated than that, but that's what he wants you to think." "Well, then, it's a good thing that he never caught me." "Hey, hey, what's that?" "A ticket?" "Your girl had it." "And then, we found this." "That's a pretty sweet key ring." "You recognize it?" "Well, I've never seen that key before, but..." "Then what is that, sir?" "That is a perfect replica of a..." "Okay, let me think." "A set of house keys." "Yes." "And is there a safe around here that you kept that key for?" "I wish, that I could say yes to that, but the key ring was my mom's." "So..." "It seems like a safe bet that whoever had the actual keys to your house is connected to this break-in." "And we're gonna need to see those keys." "I didn't keep them in the house." "I let my brother, Marcus, take them to work with him last night." "Do you have your brother's home address?" "Yeah." "I'm sorry for your loss." "What's going on, lieutenant?" "You remember mr." "Rourke from the crime scene this morning?" "Hey, man, what the hell is that about?" "What the hell's going on, man?" "Oh, you're pissed off." "I get it." "Look, last night, we found the key that matches the one that was on the hook." "And I gotta tell you, it's tough to have a brother who's a police officer." "Hey." "Is that my jacket?" "Yeah, my jacket." "Why are you doing this?" "Is that my brother's blood?" "I'm not your brother." "I'm your suspect." "Marcus rourke, you have the right to remain silent." "What the hell is this?" "This is your rights and options." "What's going on here, sergeant?" "This whole thing was a setup." "Lieutenant..." "I never even wanted to be in the force." "I wanted to go to college." "My parents were so proud of me." "I was the oldest of six kids, and I was raised to fight, but I never wanted to go to jail." "You know, but my brothers, they needed someone to look out for them and when I was 18, the only way I could help my family was to join the police." "And how did my father react when he found out what you were gonna be doing?" "He couldn't wait to be first on your father's hit list." "And when he found out that my brothers were with you?" "Well, he used his kids as an excuse, so..." "Look, let me tell you something about my family." "It was a good thing I put the badge on before Marcus got there." "But I had nothing to do with this, you know." "Yeah, I know you didn't." "Look at this, this is my jacket." "Okay, look, I know what this looks like." "But you gotta understand, he's just trying to set me up." "Lieutenant, the key from the crime scene was under the seat of your car." "We found it there." "And forensics identified it as yours." "Plus, my brother here was wearing your jacket." "Why would he want to look like you?" "Listen, I've heard of brothers doing things like that to each other, but no disrespect to Marcus, but his DNA's not gonna be under my seat." "Wait, wait, wait." "Wait, no, I gotta say something." "It was all on the up and up." "Okay." "It's my jacket." "All right?" "It was mine all along." "You guys gotta believe me." "Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait." "Wait, wait." "What?" "What, Marcus, what?" "I'm really, really sorry for what happened." "It's okay." "We know you didn't have anything to do with it." "I do." "I got your key." "All I did was lift it out of your car while you were working." "It wasn't even on the chain, though." "Is there some sort of reward I can get for this?" "Well, if there is, I'll look into it." "Hey, I've got an idea." "I'll throw you the keys back." "I'll keep the jacket." "Don't worry about it." "But I can't promise you that we won't charge you for the other crime that you're definitely going to be charged for." "What's that?" "The murder of your brother, which is nothing less than premeditated murder, for what he did to his brother." "And since we know that he was the one who actually killed your brother," "I'm afraid that's what's going to happen." "You know, for a cop who doesn't like to lie, he was pretty good at it." "He came up with some pretty convincing details." "I'm sure he really believed he was me." "But he didn't care that you were the real police, he just wanted to steal a million bucks." "You knew he was coming back to your house to get it?" "All of it." "But the police, they should've never let him in my house." "I never should've even been in there in the first place." "What's this gonna do to my sister?" "That's the problem, and that's why the police couldn't stop him, because they didn't know how long his sickness had been in there and until he got the money, he was dead to the world." "I'm afraid this is gonna be a lot harder for you than it is for him." "So he's dead?" "That was a fast guess." "I thought I was gonna have to tell her, because the D.A.'s office, they'd never be able to help her." "She said that she didn't understand why you guys would think that she did it." "Tasha's a good girl." "She's honest." "She'll tell you that, but she'll also tell you that she has this problem." "Really?" "Yeah, her credit's been screwed up since she was about 15 years old." "It's ridiculous." "I mean, she's so nice to everybody." "I should know, I've been dating her for three months." "If that was a problem, why didn't she tell me about it?" "Because you didn't want to hear about it." "You wanted to believe that she was the type of girl who would never get into trouble." "I know it's hard to understand but it's how she's always lived her life." "She's always looked out for everybody else, even her brother." "Look, it doesn't matter how you look at it." "She killed her brother and then framed me for his murder." "Why would she do that?" "Because she's got this disease." "She's been messed up on heroin for as long as she can remember." "Her brother's been supporting her, trying to get her into rehab, you know?" "She found out that he was really using it, too." "I mean, they've been selling the stuff." "She would've been the first person in the family to go to jail and Marcus didn't want that." "You told us before that she was living on the streets." "She had two key cards to this apartment." "I can't imagine she would've been sleeping there." "Well, you've got a pretty good imagination." "You were the only one she told about the two keys." "He told her not to tell anybody." "I mean, he would have known if she did." "I think he was telling the truth." "Tasha..." "I need to talk to you." "What?" "Where have you been?" "You've been gone for, like, the last six months." "Don't touch me." "I don't want to touch you either." "Don't!" "Don't!" "Stop it!" "No, I know about your drug addiction." "Tasha, I know that you were using." "Tasha!" "How many times did you get high with your brother?" "I don't know what you're talking about." "I'm your brother, not him!" "You are the one that sold your key card to Marcus, right?" "No." "You are the one who let Marcus use your apartment when he was crashing there." "I mean, it was me who stole the money from the hotel safe, you know?"
