The series is currently in production with the first season launching in the fall.

We've had a nice little vacation from the world of The Gist. It's not that I was vacationing from life. No, life has been super exciting for this family, but, it has all been so crazy that I haven't really had time for anything but survival mode over here at the blog.

But, now that I'm feeling a little refreshed I figured that I'd share the newest video from our latest project Truth Be Told. It's a little ditty called "Love Story" and it has a fun, funky sound. For some reason, the lyrics kind of reminded me of one of my favorite films of all time, Breakfast at Tiffany's. I'm not a huge fan of the movie by any means, but, I love Audrey Hepburn's classic style and fashion and I thought that her style was spot on with this song.

All in all, we're very excited to get out these first three videos and they truly show that the series is going to be filled with fun, catchy music and great lyrics, all with a positive message.

It's something that we hope will give viewers a really unique experience that they won't soon forget.

In addition to all of the awesome videos and stories that we're going to be sharing, The Gist also sat down with production company Vivid for an exclusive interview. We got to take an inside look at all of the details for this great new series that will be launching on Vivid TV later this month.

As you'll see in the interview, there is a pretty extensive look into how Vivid Media and The Gist will be taking a documentary approach to the series that will include interviews, footage, locations, stories and much more. So, when the show launches on Vivid TV on September 15th, you'll have no doubt that you're going to be completely immersed in the series.

"Truth Be Told" brings together 10 young, racially diverse families whose lives have been affected by the words and actions of public figures.

The series features real-life storylines that depict the lives of nine different families who have had their family experiences impacted by racist remarks. The families featured in the episodes include families that have been negatively impacted by their children, teenagers and elders.

These families are joined by a team of trusted journalists, producers and editors who help tell their stories. The finalized episodes show a diverse range of family life and issues including: family relationships, racism, social issues and self-discovery.

All in all, "Truth Be Told" is something that I really am excited to be involved with and really impressed by what they're going to be able to accomplish with this series. It's important that they're addressing these issues on such a large scale and they are taking a comprehensive approach to do so.
