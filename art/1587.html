Thank you. This is a really useful perspective. I really wish people would
leave their bias's at home when they discuss such things. This stuff, while
it's super interesting to me, isn't actually that useful to me on the fishing
front. A friend had a good idea when he said if you can't be an expert on
what's really happening in these systems, then simply say what you know.

It might be nice if a few folks who aren't "in the loop" stopped acting like
they know anything about it. The "you could win a Nobel Prize" is a bit over
the top.

Maybe we should be more humble when we're wrong.

" _Maybe you should think a little less of yourself and a little more of us._

 _—Tycho Brahe, to Johannes Kepler_

" _To be sure, we may yet be surprised. There are so many things about the
moon that we haven 't yet figured out. (...)_ "

Also, there are lots of people who have done Nobel Prize-quality research on
fish attractors and fish movement. Here's a quote from someone who I _think_
I've heard good things about:

"...in many species the male's olfactory organ and the female's sense of
smell have become specialized in non-mating functions. However, they can both
be stimulated by the same or similar substances." [1]

There are lots of people making great progress in the field. Some of them
aren't so well known or heard of, though, because they aren't always writing
a popular article or doing popular talks.

I understand that the writer is attempting to explain things in simple terms,
but the writer has no clue what's going on. They just spewed more bullshit.

The "science" of fish seems to be based on the fact that we don't really
understand what they do at a fundamental level. Here's a list of articles on
fish behavior in the last few years:

" _The "science" of fish seems to be based on the fact that we don 't really

Do you feel the same way about humans?

 _He then proceeds to confuse several different senses of "sense": visual
perception, sound waves, electroreception, chemical (smell and taste), and
touch._

He doesn't do much better with the _sense_ of the article itself.

~~~
bluedevil2k
Yes. I feel the same way about humans too.

The fish "smell" and "taste" is actually electroreception, and he gets that
right. He then goes on to claim that "smell" is the sense of smell, when in
fact smell is a subset of electroreception, as anyone who has trained dogs
knows. He then gets it correct again when talking about sound waves. The
information comes from electroreception and not air molecules.

The author (at least in my eyes) appears to be quite a fundamentalist when it
comes to facts.

mcguire
I don't think his errors are important. What I find interesting is the
confusion between what you would expect to find and what you actually do find.

" _They found that the fish could follow a zigzag path, tracing figure-8's
around corners, following the wall from one side to another, even when the
wall was only two inches tall, no thicker than a book. But if there were a
three-inch wide hole in the wall, the fish could find it. “The fish can
navigate around the smallest of obstacles,” he said._ "

How about the little guys? They are smaller than book size; you can't really
get away from them. And they don't have any vision or smell or whatever else.

" _He then proceeds to confuse several different senses of "sense": visual
perception, sound waves, electroreception, chemical (smell and taste), and
touch._"

So, that's a problem, is it? The author didn't read the original paper, he
just read something in a popular magazine about the research.

" _He then gets it correct again when talking about sound waves._ "

But not quite. If you want to detect sound, your noise needs to be greater
than the ambient noise.

The whole article suffers from the assumption that electromagnetic fields are
the only information an animal can get from their surroundings. That is not
true, as all information is translated into electric pulses by the receptors.
The most advanced animals are the dolphins, who have a sense of echolocation
capable of detecting obstacles down to 1-2mm. Of course, an animal without
sense of sight has no way of knowing what it looks like, so it needs some
other way of finding out what an object is. That’s why dolphins have a strong
smell sense (olfaction).

The science is much more interesting than the science writer's understanding of
the science. There's this big difference between "we don't know how the
electroreceptors work" and "electroreception doesn't play a significant role in
the animal's sensory information chain", and he misses it entirely.

It might not be the "central dogma" of biology that sensory organs provide
their only source of input. But in the real world, it is a _good_ assumption,
and ignoring it is basically negligent.

What about all the fish that don't behave like this?

Well, he didn't say "this is the most common behaviour" did he?

Fair enough.

This can be simplified to an electron microscope, but only if you are a
scientist.

~~~
JoeAltmaier
This is _not_ true. A microscope is simply a way to magnify something. The
electron microscope may be better, but that's a different claim, about
technology. It's _completely different_ than what's discussed here, by the
author.

~~~
dismal2
You seem confused. People know there are things that can be detected beyond
the range of normal human vision, so their eyes in real life. What are they
actually seeing? That's the question this article is exploring. In the end, I
think what you are getting at is the fact that the author needs to back up his
point more with facts and data rather than just making an assumption about how
this data can be transferred. But yeah, the fish are getting electrical
signals from their environment. I guess I didn't make that clear enough.

~~~
JoeAltmaier
I agree with all that. But an electron microscope and the ability to see with
electromagnetic radiation are completely different. One involves making things
smaller (the electron microscope), the other involves getting energy out of
the environment (the electroreceptive cells).

The electroreceptive cells, are not really using or seeing electromagnetism.
They're responding to the current in air moving by the fish. So, the question
is: what's the fish 'seeing' with those receptors? Not electromagnetic waves
caused by electromagnetism, but current in air, which is really just air
moving. So why does this matter?

Because this whole article is based on a total misunderstanding of the
sciences (not the fish, not electroreception) involved. It has</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:11
