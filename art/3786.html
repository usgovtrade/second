# **CABOT AVE.**

This upscale neighborhood is known for its grand homes and the luxurious boutiques that line the streets. The main street, Cabot Avenue, is a little like the Champs-Élysées, but more exclusive. Many of the houses were built as summer residences, so the homes can be somewhat removed from the activity that takes place on the street, but be sure to wander down the side streets to see the gardens, fountains, and greenery. Don't be surprised if you see a celebrity; in the past the Cabot Avenue neighborhood was home to a good number of famous people, and you still have the opportunity to meet a few locals who were former VIP guests.

The Ritz-Carlton Montréal Montreal's only Ritz-Carlton property, which shares a block with the Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth, is at the epicenter of the Cabot Avenue quarter. Located at 1255 rue Peel, the Ritz has been a popular choice for visiting dignitaries for decades. The nearby Fairmont hotel is another worthy stop for anyone interested in its historical significance. Founded in 1912, the hotel is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. In 2009 it was named one of the Top 25 Hotels in North America by Condé Nast Traveler. The Fairmont's famous lobby bar, the Living Room, is a popular meeting spot for guests and locals alike.
