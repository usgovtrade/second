"The Horror in the Dark." "Monsters." "All right, this is creepy." "No, it's great." "It's great." "The place that's in danger should feel threatened by the environment, so if it's in a mansion or a big, scary place, it should be big and scary." "But here we have a little girl in her room and it's a little girl that lives in this huge mansion." "The girl is vulnerable, so it's a different kind of scary." "Oh, my God!" "Hey, no, don't be scared." "We're not scared." "This way." "Wait." "Come back!" "What happened?" "Nicky?" "Come on, man." "What you got?" "I'm not going in there." "Get off your ass." "Let's go, let's go, let's go!" "Come on." "You want this?" "I don't know what I want." "I'm just scared!" "Yes, you're right." "It's scary." "There's scary things everywhere." "I can see your will is strong." "Very strong!" "Hello, is that a gift?" "Is that why you're here?" "My aunt gave it to me when I was eight years old." "It's beautiful." "You're close to the surface." "I felt it the second I saw you." "You're going to be a great warrior." "Do you see that?" "One of the scariest moments in any movie is that first feeling that somebody's behind you, like..." "That could be my dad." "I don't know if I should look around." "What happened in that room?" "Mom, I told you not to do it." "Can't you fix it?" "This is not a VCR you can fix." "Look, some things you can fix and some things you can't, okay?" "You just can't go messing around in this world." "You hear me?" "I don't think you understand." "You don't have a choice." "Sure I do." "You can choose not to be in that house or that can be your choice." "What did you just say?" "I mean, I didn't mean it like that." "It's just, if you can do anything, then why..." "You're just being childish!" "No." "I am a child." "You're just being an asshole." "No." "You know what I think?" "You know what I think?" "I think you're scared of your own damn ghosts." "I don't believe in ghosts, though." "Of course you do." "And that house is waiting for you to go in and try to get something." "What?" "So what are you saying, I'm crazy?" "No, I'm saying I have faith in you." "Yeah, well, I don't believe in ghosts or that house." "Then I guess you won't mind if I go get a shovel." "Maybe I should try the grave." "That could be good." "That could work." "I'm not going in that house!" "Dad!" "Mom, you could come with me." "Yeah, right." "And leave this to you guys?" "We might need help." "You might need help." "What if you run into something, and you can't get away?" "What if something happens to you in there?" "Which would you rather be in this world, knowing you're not in that house or some crazy haunted place with all these ghosts?" "I don't care if you think this is crazy, we're all going in the same place." "Mom!" "I'll be okay, okay?" "I'll be back tomorrow, I promise." "Yeah, right." "Fine." "I love you." "Go on." "Be careful." "And look for anything that might tell us what happened to them." "I love you, too." "All right, good night." "Don't stay up too late." "Don't stay up too late, all right?" "Okay, you, too." "Now, don't let the cat out of the bag, but they've got you carrying around her stuffed animal." "Okay, okay." "But I didn't bring it." "All right, so what is going on?" "You guys seem all weird today." "What's wrong?" "If you can't sleep, why don't you tell us a story?" "I'm sorry about the story." "You see..." "Now, I'm all out of stories." "How about the one about the great white turkey?" "The one about my sister and the three bears?" "Okay, I get it." "It's stupid." "Sorry." "I don't really know what happened to them." "I think it's my turn now." "You..." "You wanted to..." "You want to go to bed now?" "Well, I guess that's it, then." "Okay." "Good night, honey." "Good night." "What happened to that sister?" "And what about that sister?" "Why didn't you let her go?" "I think you should get up and clean your room." "I hate it when you leave clothes all over the floor." "Did you go in my room?" "Why would I go in your room?" "That's a good question." "What?" "Why would you?" "Get out." "I'm going to sleep." "Yeah, me, too." "Good night." "What the..." "Hello?" "It's not funny, you guys." "He looked really mad." "There's something wrong here and we are going to get to the bottom of it, okay?" "I'm not going to pretend it's not happening." "There's something in this house and we're not just going to ignore it." "No, we're not going to ignore it." "We're going to get to the bottom of this." "Right now." "It's been happening for years." "You know it." "He's been talking to them, to ghosts." "He's so sick." "I think he's got a fever." "They've been talking to him, I know it." "And I think he was stealing the medicine from my house." "Now, what happened today?" "And this is what you saw." "Why don't you show it to them, honey?" "I came back from the store and I saw that it was open so I went in and you know what I saw in there?" "No." "What'd you see?" "There was one of them." "They stole the medicine and I got hit." "You got hit?" "How did you get hit?" "I got hit in the head." "How could you get hit in your head if you got hit?" "You're going to wake the kid." "Let me see." "Come here." "Come here." "Right here." "Is there any marks?" "Is it sore?" "Show me where it hurts." "Is it sore?" "Here?" "Yeah, right there." "Mom, we need to get to the hospital." "No, no." "He needs a doctor." "Mom, you should go and get a bandage or something." "Yeah, let's go to the hospital, honey." "It's not that bad." "No, it's not that bad." "If you really think it's that bad, you should get a bandage or something because he could have a serious injury." "You need a doctor to check that out." "Mom, we should go to the hospital." "Hold it." "Don't just get a bandage." "Okay, it's not that bad, but I promise, honey, if you really think it's that bad, we'll get a bandage." "We'll get a bandage." "Come on." "Let's go." "Come on." "If you think you should do something else..." "But I want you to know that I'm going to call that doctor in the morning." "If you think you should do that." "I'm going to call that doctor in the morning and we'll see what happens." "What do you mean you're going to call?" "Honey, this happened yesterday." "I'll call when I get in." "You can go back to sleep." "Okay, okay." "Mom!" "Dad!" "Mom!" "Dad!" "Mom!" "Dad!" "Mom!" "Dad!" "What?" "Mom!" "Dad!" "We're in the middle of the living room." "All right, we're all going to go together." "I guess we should go together." "What happened?" "You were just talking to me?" "You..." "You don't remember?" "No." "What's going on here?" "What's going on here?" "What?" "I have no idea." "You've been acting really weird lately." "Mom." "You're the one who went into their bedroom." "Why don't you tell them?" "I don't know what you guys are talking about." "What were you doing in their bedroom?" "I found this in there." "She has a really big appetite, you know that?" "Hey, honey, are you okay?" "Do you want a cracker?" "Yeah." "That's a nice shirt." "Thanks, Mom." "You sure you want a cracker?" "I think</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:06
