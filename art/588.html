Now. Or I urn!"" "Himself was afraid and would not, so she urned his eyes out." "But of course..." "In the end he himself urned, the hound did not, and both were left to wander the world as ghosts." "My friends, I do not tell you this story to frighten you, but only to warn you." "If you should meet with all misfortunes and misadventures, if you should lose your children and wife, if you are made the fool of, if you suffer, then the worst is not yet over." "I do not know how this will come to you." "But I warn you." "Get away from here." "Get away quickly, before it is too late." "I tell you, go away, before they come to destroy you." "Get away." "My friends, my friends." "It is a very sad day for a very bad woman." "I am told that the young gentleman whom I used to love so much has just been found guilty." "And although I have not seen him these many years, they tell me that the poor fellow looks even worse than he did when he first betrayed me." "Very well." "Now it's your turn, my dear." "Now you will tell me all your little secrets." "But I shall make you pay for it." "Oh, not here, not now." "Come." "Come, come, my friends." "There are many other rooms in my house." "Come in, my dear." "My pretty, little, young woman." "My little treasure." "Yes." "Yes, you want my sweet daughter." "You need her to do your dirty work." "You want her to feed your vile desires." "You want her to satisfy your lechery." "You want her." "You want her." "My precious little daughter." "What have you done with her?" "You know what I'm going to do with her." "You need to have your dirty desires satisfied." "It's you who needs her, you filthy piece of filth." "Get your filthy, perverse..." "My brother, get away from here!" "My brother..." "This is my house." "Get away from here!" "You wretched pig!" "What have you done?" "Let me go!" "You know that my daughter hasn't long to live." "And you, you're not young." "I will find out your secret." "You'll pay for all of this." "You are not like the others." "You are not a man." "Don't come any closer!" "Come back!" "Help!" "Help!" "She's lying, there's something in her throat." "You stay there." "You stay there." "Get me a cloth and some water." "You don't want the poor girl to die, do you?" "And who will feed your vile wants?" "Let me go!" "Come here, you." "Let me go." "I said, come here." "The knife!" "The knife!" "Don't kill me." "Don't kill me." "I'll tell you." "I'll tell you." "There is a secret here." "Don't kill me." "Your knife is not sharp enough." "Your knife is not sharp enough." "I know." "I know." "Your knife is not sharp enough." "I know where she is." "Come with me." "And if I don't?" "Then you will leave this room with a rope around your neck." "Take him back to his cell." "If I have to tell him about my brother, I will make him my wife." "Yes." "This time I will convince him." "Look at me, Dario." "Look at me!" "My brother." "He has seen all the women that are in my house." "He is jealous." "He is blind." "And if he continues to see the other women, you will be blind and he will be dead." "Tell me." "My brother..." "This is a very beautiful woman." "You are right." "This is a very beautiful woman." "This is a very lovely woman." "Very lovely." "When I look at her, I do not want to remember." "If I do not want to remember," "I do not want to remember." "What are you doing?" "You will ruin your eyesight." "I don't care!" "Just one more kiss and then I'll go." "And the more I kiss her, the better I feel." "Do you think she will give me any pleasure?" "I've never known anyone like her." "I have never known anyone like her either." "There are moments when I look at her and I think, "If only this woman" ""if only she could be my wife."" "How can I marry her?" "Then you will become an old fool like me." "Don't take such chances, my friend." "Don't take such chances." "And after a short time with a woman," "I became so drunk that I vomited on the ground." "In one gulp, my brother drank three good bottles of wine." "Well, now you know how to act like a man." "That woman, she..." "She is a very... very wicked woman." "Now, on my honor, I'll never see her again." "But on the following day, Dario would make his way there as if drawn by a force he could not resist." "That woman, she..." "She is a very, very wicked woman." "I cannot be your friend anymore." "Oh, my God, what will I do?" "Come on, now." "No, now." "Look." "Let me go." "Don't be afraid." "I'm not going to hurt you." "No, please." "No, I beg you." "She is evil." "Leave her." "Let me help you." "I can't breathe." "I can't." "My love." "Don't die." "Don't die." "What's that?" "Is this...?" "Or is this?" "Now I begin to get it." "What does the house mean?" "Nothing." "I begin to see, I must speak with her." "Hello?" "No, my God." "No." "I will never see her again." "Get your friend to confess." "Tell him that, the next time he looks at me like that, I will kill him." "No, please, take me back to my house, so that I can die there." "You must kill my brother." "You must kill my brother." "Kill him." "You must kill him for me." "No." "Kill him." "Don't go, don't go, don't go!" "No, don't go, don't go, don't go!" "No, don't go, don't go!" "Don't go." "Dario." "You must not hate yourself, even if you were not a great lover." "You must not hate yourself." "There is still one thing you could have done that you did not do." "I don't understand." "You could have asked me what this thing was that I kept hidden in my throat." "Yes, what I should have said at that moment was, "My friend, my husband, now I must die."" "I don't understand." "You're a very intelligent man." "I knew it the first time I saw you." "No, I do not know what you are." "But I do know what I am." "And I knew it the first time I saw you." "My husband..." "My friend." "Yes, this is an enigma." "I should have said it." "I should have said it." "You're an enigma." "No, no, no, it's not an enigma." "It is you." "You." "When I look at you, when I look at her, when I see that," "I can do nothing but hate myself." "Because she is nothing more than a whore." "This poor bitch." "Poor, stupid bitch." "I can never blame her for anything." "Look at me, look at me!" "Don't look at me." "If you're going to look at me, look at me this way." "I want you to understand." "See?" "Understand." "Come closer." "I want to kiss you, my dear wife." "Come closer." "Come closer." "Haven't you seen what they're doing?" "You know, I want you to love me." "I want you to love me." "We'll live like this." "We'll live together in the country." "In the countryside." "I love you." "I am not speaking to you, idiot." "How come you're not speaking to me?" "I love you." "I love you." "Let's go away." "I want to leave." "I want to leave." "So tell me, tell me." "I will never see you again." "Why don't you speak to me?" "Why don't you speak to me?" "I must go now." "You know that." "You know it." "When I go," "I will go without regrets." "But I will always regret the things that I have done to you." "What are you doing?" "The same thing as before."
