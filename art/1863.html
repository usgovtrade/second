"I'm sorry about the way this turned out." "And this is kind of embarrassing." "This was actually my first time." "Right." "Sure." "Not exactly the first time playing doctor, is it?" "Wait, no." "My boyfriend took me to a party, and I just kind of went for it." "It's kind of complicated." "I'm sorry." "It's okay." "No biggie." "Don't feel bad about it." "You know, I'm actually pretty new at this myself." "Really?" "Yeah, I just started a few weeks ago." "Wow, it sure feels like a while ago for me." "I was actually nervous that first night." "But I watched a lot of YouTube videos." "I'm sure you know what to do by now." "Not really." "I'm kidding." "Kind of." "I actually can't believe I've gone this long without sucking face." "You know what they say..." "It's like going to the dentist, but in a good way." "Actually, I'm a bit of a YouTube virgin myself." "Really?" "Yeah, I think maybe you were the first." "Good to know I'm not the only one." "And this would be what, a doctor-patient sort of situation?" "No, not exactly." "See, I'm not seeing anyone right now." "It's just..." "It's been awhile, and I was wondering if I could come by and see you..." "Yeah, like for what?" "I don't know." "I just thought maybe we could, I don't know, talk about what happened." "I could maybe cheer you up a little, you know?" "I'm kind of down in the dumps right now, too." "We could talk about it and stuff?" "Okay." "Let's get started." "So are we going to talk about why we are still in our clothes?" "My car's here." "Let's go." "I gotta go." "My parents are going out of town this weekend." "Okay." "That's perfect." "Yeah." "They're going on this stupid, romantic getaway for two weeks." "But it's not stupid and romantic if you have a boyfriend, which I don't." "Okay." "Maybe a little stupid if you can't have sex with your girlfriend, which I also can't." "So you wanna come over?" "Yeah, sure." "Yeah?" "All right." "So what time?" "Why aren't you calling me?" "Stop yelling." "You're scaring me." "You're scaring me, too, all right?" "Listen, just meet me at 7:30, okay?" "Just get here, okay?" "I got us the worst table in the back corner." "You'll love it." "I thought we agreed not to see each other until we got it together." "Well, you changed your mind." "I guess I changed mine, too." "Can't this wait till we get back to the house?" "Oh, yeah." "Sure." "We can talk about all that stuff." "I promise." "We'll sit at the counter, and we'll have pizza and beer..." "I promise it'll be great." "I'll just see you at 7:30, okay?" "Okay." "Okay, bye." "Hey, it's me." "I'm sure you're out having a great time with Michael tonight." "Probably gonna hook up with him, too, huh?" "Anyway, what happened to us?" "That was so stupid." "Stupid, too bad you had to do this?" "I got it." "Good." "Then we can start tomorrow." "No." "We can't." "You can't make another mistake, Michael." "We have to start over." "But I don't think I want to start over." "Okay, look, I understand." "You're confused and scared, but I'm not going anywhere." "I promise you that." "Okay, can you hang on a second?" "Hello?" "Good, you're still home." "Who was that?" "Not important." "What's important is that we begin again." "Right now." "This is what you want, right?" "Say it." "Yeah." "Yeah, that's what I want." "Let's start over." "Okay, great." "Now... this is gonna be tricky." "Tricky's good." "When you come in my room tonight..." "Well, I'm coming in with pizza and beer." "And maybe a little tequila?" "No." "No tequila." "Okay, I'm not that kind of girl." "I have beer." "No." "No beer." "No beer?" "No, it'll mess up my stomach." "Oh, yeah." "So I'll see you later, right?" "We're gonna eat and..." "Okay." "Okay, good, bye." "Damn it." "What happened?" "I couldn't stop him." "How about you?" "Me?" "No." "I couldn't do it." "Lila, I need you." "Let's go." "Let's go." "No!" "Oh, yeah, baby!" "Oh, yeah!" "This is disgusting." "Yeah, yeah." "Mmm-hmm." "I don't wanna do this anymore." "You're such a slut!" "Get away!" "Get off!" "What the hell was that?" "I told you I didn't want to do this anymore." "What are you doing?" "Nothing." "Then why don't you get your ass up and come help me?" "Stop calling me." "You're so sexy!" "No, no, no." "Lila!" "Lila!" "Come on, please." "Lila!" "Please, stop." "Come here, baby." "Why are you doing this to me?" "What did I ever do to you?" "Please, stop." "Get away from me!" "Help!" "Help!" "I can't get up!" "What the hell are you doing?" "I can't get up." "I can't get up." "What the hell are you doing?" "What am I doing?" "What's going on?" "We're being robbed." "Help me!" "Not the window, babe." "They're out there." "No, no, I didn't have anything to do with this." "They're out there." "No, I didn't." "Okay, look, I didn't have anything to do with this." "What is it?" "Please!" "Please, someone help me!" "Hey, what's going on?" "Lila?" "Lila, what's going on?" "Nothing." "Nothing." "Nothing." "What is it?" "Oh, my God!" "Let's go!" "Let's go!" "Go!" "Go!" "Help me!" "Get her in the house!" "Get her in the house!" "Get her inside!" "Oh, my God!" "Someone help her!" "Help her!" "Oh, my God." "It's okay." "It's okay." "Hello?" "Is somebody there?" "Who is it?" "Someone's been shot." "Yes." "In the house?" "Yeah." "How many bullets?" "I don't know." "It's him, isn't it?" "Yeah, you better stay out there." "I'm coming." "Please..." "Hold on." "Help me!" "Help me!" "Oh, my God." "Let me in!" "Let me in!" "Please!" "Please, hurry!" "Hurry, please!" "I'm begging you!" "Please!" "Please help me!" "Let me in!" "Please, let me in!" "Come on, please!" "Open the door!" "Please let me in!" "Please!" "Oh, God, hurry, please!" "He's right outside." "Oh, God!" "Hurry!" "Hurry!" "Open the door!" "Please, he's right outside." "Please!" "Please open it!" "Come on, man." "Come on." "Thank God you came." "Oh, God, the door wouldn't open!" "You guys just go." "I'll take care of everything." "The guy's right outside." "Just go!" "Get out of here!" "Go, man, go." "No, I'm not leaving you!" "God damn it, I'm staying!" "I'm staying!" "Just go." "We'll deal with him." "Go!" "Go!" "Go!" "All right, you bastard, come on!" "All right, God damn it." "Let me in!" "I'll kill her!" "I'll kill her!" "If you don't let me in, I'll kill her!" "Come on, open the door!" "Open the door!" "What are you doing?" "The deadbolt won't work." "Let me in, God damn it!" "Please, hurry!" "Oh, God, hurry!" "Please!" "Open the door!" "Come on!" "Open the door!" "Lila?" "Yes?" "It's Michael." "Are you okay?" "Why won't you let me in?" "I've got something to tell you." "We've got to get rid</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:37
