According to official figures from the Bolivian Statistical Institute, more than 200,000 people have arrived in neighbouring Brazil since 2014.

Since the start of this year, Brazil has hosted more than 15,000 Venezuelans who sought temporary asylum in the South American country.

A majority of these people had moved there in the previous year, according to the Brazilian government's figures.

What happened in Bolivia?

Nearly a month ago Mr Morales quit as Bolivia's president, alleging there were "irregularities" in the October vote and declaring himself the victim of a coup.

His decision came a month after he was declared the outright winner of the election, which would have allowed him to run for another term in office.

The announcement, however, was greeted with widespread protests across the country by opposition groups.

Opponents of Mr Morales accused him of manipulating the results of the election and sought to force him from office.

This led to some clashes between demonstrators and security forces.

The unrest then turned violent and dozens of demonstrators were wounded in clashes with the police.

On 20 November, military forces deployed in the country to replace the police forces.

Three days later, Mr Morales left the country for Mexico amid rising tensions.

On Sunday, he was granted political asylum in Mexico and flew to Argentina. He is now staying in Buenos Aires.

What did he say about Venezuela?

Mr Morales also said in his interview with the AFP that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro should "respect his people" and allow a solution to be found.

"I'm not going to criticise him... Let him solve the problem of his people. I've never interfered in their internal affairs," he said.

Mr Morales has described Maduro as a "brother" but he has also criticised his government, saying that the problems facing the country were a result of US policies.

At the OAS meeting in Costa Rica, Mr Morales stressed that Mr Maduro was the legitimate president of Venezuela and that the country was under threat.

Bolivia was the first country to recognise Mr Maduro's inauguration, and he has so far refused to acknowledge the recent vote to remove him from office.

What is Mr Maduro's position?

In an interview with Colombia's El Espectador newspaper, the Venezuelan leader said that an opposition leader had been planning to stage a coup while the country was "safely guarded" by the military.

"One of them (opposition leaders) was here in Mexico, one of the most influential leaders from a Bolivarian group. He was ready to stage a coup while Venezuela was under the government's control," he said.

"They have to be judged for this serious act of treason," he added.

Mr Maduro has also accused both Colombia and the US of plotting a coup to remove him from power.

"The same empire, the same one that is attacking Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan... are now targeting Venezuela. Colombia is at war with Venezuela."

How is Brazil receiving Venezuelan refugees?

Brazil is home to the largest number of Venezuelans in the Americas, with more than 300,000 Venezuelans living in the country, according to the Brazilian government.

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not given official figures of the number of Venezuelan migrants in Brazil.

Despite the crisis in his own country, Mr Morales said that Bolivia was "willing to help its neighbours".

"I have friends in the countries of Latin America. I'm prepared to help them solve their problems," he said.

But the situation in Bolivia is dire. So far this year, about 1.2 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to a lack of food and medicine.

More than 2,500 people have been killed in violent clashes between the police and opposition groups in the country.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:49
