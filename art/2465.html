Bluetooth®

Bluetooth is a technology that connects mobile phones, tablets, computers and other wireless devices to your wireless accessories. Bluetooth is a low-power solution for up to 100 feet (30 meters) between devices. This provides great battery life. You can still access your Bluetooth devices even if they are in an area with no network or internet access.
