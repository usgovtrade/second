CHAPTER 1.
The First Wave of Modernity
A History of Western Civilization: 1500–1820
Nearly three hundred years ago, on the basis of a rich combination of historical inquiry and
philosophical speculation, the great early Enlightenment thinker Immanuel Kant summarized
the past three hundred years of Western civilization in the following sentence:
Humanity has now entered on a new era and a new hemisphere.
Kant's statement appeared in the Introduction to a three-part study that, because of its
theoretical scope and its bold historical sweep, was not only to give him a name—that of
Homo Novus—but also to mark the intellectual point of departure for the Enlightenment in
Europe. By this definition, the Enlightenment was not a set of political, social, or economic
doctrines that suddenly appeared on the eighteenth-century scene, but an age whose seeds
had first been planted in the seventeenth century. Whence its name, the age of "Enlighten-ment."
The name, as used by Kant, had already entered the popular vernacular; indeed, it would be
a mere quarter of a century before Sir Thomas More would describe the seventeenth century
as the "Enlighten-ment," and before Voltaire would adopt the term for his own political
party in pre-revolutionary France. During the next century and a half, the epithet would
become associated with both the movement for "Enlighten-ment" in the arts and sciences
and the revolution itself. "Enlightenment," moreover, was to connote a complex range of
innovative political, social, and cultural theories and practices whose impact was to be felt
throughout the modern era of the West. As a result of its influence, it would begin to con-note
also a sense of distance from the past; and even if nineteenth-century theorists of
progress never achieved the self-confidence of Kant and his immediate successors, the
imperative to transcend "our ancient prejudices and errors"1 was now firmly in place.
The impulse to move on to a new "hemisphere" represented, in fact, only the most
prosaic application of an extraordinarily rich intellectual and spiritual ferment, a ferment
that had first arisen in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Western Europe. By the
seventeenth century, the ferment of the Renaissance—which, as Harold Perkin has observed,
2 consisted not only of a revival of classical learning but also of the study of Greek, a reworking of the Latin
tongue, and an exploration of new forms of spatial and temporal perception—had helped to
shape a new outlook on nature and a new sense of art and of life. In reaction against the
medievalism of the late Middle Ages, its roots deeply entrenched in feudal practices, an age
that may be called the Renaissance was dedicated to celebrating the new and the modern.
The goal of the emerging movement, which found its first theorists in such figures as
Petrarch, Boccaccio, Desiderius Erasmus, Galileo, and Bacon, was the reformation of the
past. As Foucault and others have suggested, however, the Renaissance could also be
considered the first great philosophical modernity, because the quest for a new start in
thought and culture involved the attempt to "understand [the present] not only for [one's-elf
but] also for [one's] forebears."3 It was an attempt to re-evaluate and to revitalize both
the content and the form of the medieval inheritance. The term "Renaissance" itself implies
not only an overturning of the past but also a reaffirmation of the classical tradition.
