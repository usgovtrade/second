Whereas it used to focus on the paranormal activity in and around the historic village of Bodmin, Cornwall, it has now broadened out, and taken an investigation into the history of the village.

The village of Bodmin was once a booming tourist destination, packed with day visitors coming for the mineral baths and spas, which flourished during the 1800s.

Like a number of resorts in Cornwall, it began to decline, but then, like many rural communities in Britain during the 20th century, it was hit by the second World War.

As war ravaged neighbouring towns and villages in England and France, Bodmin received a relatively small but significant influx of injured soldiers from 1940 onwards. The casualties of war are often quiet in death, but in Bodmin their graves tell a grim tale.

The story of the wartime cemetery is told in a series of interviews with the curator of Bodmin’s cemetery, and the author of two books on the military casualties of the war.

Together, Richard’s story and the military cemetery’s stories of sacrifice, heroism and loss of life, illuminate the history of the village, and shine a light on some very dark corners.

The story of Bodmin’s wartime cemetery is the focus of Part One of The Black Tide Podcast’s first season.
