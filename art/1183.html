There are no beeves (or cows) on the site. The name of the store was borrowed from a store that did actually sell beeves - a butcher shop located in New York City from 1912 - 1948.

Where's Marmalade?

No, no marmalade either. The marmalade photo is from a different link, from a different location, and doesn't feature an actual marmalade jar. So why the name? The best guess I can make is that it is a play on the word "marmelade," which was a popular term in the mid-1800s for the concoction of juice and peel of a citrus fruit. Wikipedia says:

The term was used in recipes using the name of the fruit (the generic term used at that time being "sour grape"), particularly for fruit in syrup, usually grape, from the 18th century, but it was not until the late 18th century or early 19th century that the name marmalade was also used in this sense, with the name becoming generalized to refer to a wide range of preparations of this type.

If that's not enough to make your head spin, you may want to read on. And while you're at it, the best thing to do is click on one of the random links - they're good for a laugh. But first, some definitions...

What's So Bad About That?

Oh, don't get me started on this topic. No one was named after this stuff and if you didn't grow up with a mouth that was constantly and inappropriately ajar, you may want to give it a miss. And the other words in this list aren't even close. Don't ask why they're bad. Just don't. They are.

What's the Beef? is a website in which we are invited to laugh at stupid things people do and say. It's not intended as a personal attack, nor is it an invitation to act rudely. Although if you want to, be our guest. Beef. Beef like you just saw in the video.

We're not trying to tell you what to eat. We're not saying you shouldn't laugh at a stupid comment. Or, when you find a funny photo, a link that you'd like to share with a friend, perhaps you shouldn't do that either. We're not telling you how to behave or what to do.

If you do follow us, feel free to laugh or roll your eyes or throw a few expletives in. But if you want to share a photo with a friend, if you want to make a silly comment to a complete stranger, if you want to post something stupid, you can. It may be a bad idea, it may not be. But you should do whatever you want to do. As you can probably guess, we really don't care.

I have no doubt that you have a brain and that if you use it, you can look at a site such as What's the Beef? and understand that it's not really a big deal. We're not telling you what to think. We're not telling you what to say. We're just laughing at the silliness of human behavior.

And besides, we're not always so serious, either. We did just post a funny image that features nothing but bacon.

What's the Beef? (Or, Why We're Called That)

That's the original explanation of our site's name: from the comments left on some of our images. It's not a joke. Or a rip-off of someone else's joke. We didn't have the sense to come up with a witty and pithy name for our site that could withstand the years of abuse it would suffer on the Internet. I know that doesn't really justify our name, but, well, it's the best I can do.

And yes, we are aware that we are just showing off and that it is really easy to find websites with that name that actually link to actual beef. Except that our name is so short, with no vowels and only one consonant, so we're easy to distinguish from the other beef sites on the web. If you look closely at the text for the images on any other beef site, you will see that they don't have the same name as us. This is not true on other web pages, of course.

It might be an indication of our lack of originality, but we were originally going to call the site "What's the Beef?" You'll notice that's the second title I came up with for this site. For some reason, it's difficult for me to come up with original titles. Perhaps it's because I have a lot of things I would like to call my site. I'm not so good at coming up with names. I had a hard time thinking of this one, too.
