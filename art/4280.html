This is sad and depressing, and I'm not even a space geek. I wonder if there
are other non-criminal uses of space that will find traction in the near
future.

Yes. Private citizens have already been renting out their space in low earth
orbit on CubeSats [0].

"Low earth orbit is a neighborhood of the space in the low gravity layer
around the Earth. The boundaries of this layer are the Kármán line, at 100 km
(62 mi) above sea level, and the geosynchronous orbital zone at geostationary
orbit. NASA and other international space agencies consider LEO, at an altitude
of 160-2000 km (99-1250 mi), to be a middle atmosphere." [1]

I am not sure why people want to do space tourism. I assume most people have
read that in the next 10-20 years space tourism will become economically
feasible. Is that really true? This space tourism stuff is a bit ridiculous to
me. Would anyone rent their private bedroom to any Tom, Dick and Harry?

I think there's a pretty obvious benefit to the whole "putting money in my
pocket" thing. It's basically a "sneak in and see the world" experience. I've
heard quite a bit of anecdotal evidence for it being popular with couples in
the past. I think that's less of an issue now than it was a decade or two ago,
but I still think it's going to be an attractive option for some (although
that's definitely in the minority of reasons I can see people wanting to do it
(from a marketing perspective))

I would argue that space tourism is going to be an incredible boost for the
human race on Earth. People who have had no opportunity to venture out into
the universe are going to suddenly see possibilities open up to them. They’ll
start to realize that the Earth can be beautiful from another perspective.
They’ll realize that everything that exists on Earth is not necessarily
magical, and that we really are just one small speck of rock in a universe of
stars.

All that being said, I still think the most “extreme” way to get to Mars is to
grow a clone of yourself, put it in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, send it to
Mars, and then die. If you want an extreme experience, this is how you should
go about it.

You might be on to something. People who have had no opportunity to venture out
into the universe start realizing there is a huge possibility to make money
without leaving their families behind.

~~~
xvector
I think I’ve seen this myself, but only anecdotally. There is an immense group
of people who want to be away from their families and enjoy the money they get
while doing it, such as traveling to see family who live a lot further away or
maybe being more open about spending money on frivolous things (clothing, etc)
to spend time with family and friends.

And that is without even getting into people who aren’t as financially
successful as others but want to “compete” with the lives of others in a game.

These are the kinds of people who have really been helped by space travel -
now, not later. But perhaps they would have gotten those opportunities no
matter what.

~~~
mav3rick
I would think it would be a lot more. People who could have had more children
and now think they can't. What a cruel deception they made up for themselves.

~~~
xvector
I have no idea if anyone in this thread has gotten married, had children, or
has ever wanted to. It’s hard to say. The point is the space trip isn’t what’s
keeping them away, it’s the job/family/etc. There are many reasons why people
can’t do something, and space travel is simply one of them. It’s never a given
that one day, SpaceX will send a craft to Mars that is able to return. In fact,
it may very well never happen.

I’ve also worked with several people who came to America because they couldn’t
find work at home. And they didn’t care to make money here - they wanted a
“risky” job because it would be nice to have a new experience and a chance to
live in the big city.

~~~
mav3rick
I wouldn't want to live in big city but not have to move out of my hometown
that I spent 25 years living in. I wouldn't want to leave my career either
which I worked 25 years for. I would want to still work at the company I love.
I don't want to move to the city to work for another company and be away from
my wife and kids.

At one time it would have been the only answer for what to do with a space
trip. You could sit back and enjoy the view or you could do something
constructive on it.

Now? You can get just about anything you want, and that is a large part of the
problem. We have far too many options. It's become just about entertainment
and ego.

Well, at least there is plenty of business, science, and political work to be
done on earth. If we don't have the resources to do the science we need to
survive on Mars, humanity is already a failure.

~~~
james-skemp
I wouldn't say humanity failed though. Instead I'd say space programs in the
80's/90's were a part of that humanity failing. Humanity doesn't need the
people who did it to stay on earth.

It's kind of like arguing that we need more astronauts at the moment.

It's already so popular. My friends and relatives visit SpaceX and NASA web
portals every day, buy everything in their range, and plan voyages in space.
At least some of them would gladly do space flights with their own money. The
people are there, just we don't do tourism often.

I can see this being popular with people who don't take their jobs or careers
too seriously but who aren't too risk-averse. It's a "safe space" which is a
lot easier for a bunch of non-technical people to access than more extreme
trips like long-term space habitation or inter-stellar travel.

The key to human sustainability on earth is for people to have a better work
environment. This is one of the reasons we should not focus on space and
instead focus on automation and making work more productive for the average
person.

I'd like to know what the business plans are for these companies? My guess is
they're going to be able to capture a lot of demand, but I'd guess that most
space tourists have a budget of around $200k to $1M.

It seems like if you can make your ticket cost as low as possible you're going
to be competitive, but what happens once it goes above $100k (not including
costs to get there)? If this catches on and becomes too cheap they may need</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:33:19
