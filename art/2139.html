One day after a particularly grueling run, four friends come across a mysterious message that leaves them wondering about the life they should be living. Set in the dark days of a future society, this story examines the nature of reality, and the consequences of following the crowd.

A Growing Man

Herman and Ragnar were brothers before, but a single terrible mistake has transformed the former into a twisted soul who wanders the countryside alone with nothing more than his own bad memories, his guilt, and a bloodthirsty desire for vengeance. When he finally comes upon a town, he learns there is no salvation for him, so he decides to turn the tables and exact his brand of justice upon the people who wronged him and his brother.

Eve White Eats Apricots

For someone like Adam, the act of getting food every day is a major undertaking. He spends hours each day working for it, scrounging around in the garbage and dumpster diving for scraps of edible food. He hides in alleyways, hoping that no one will notice him as he goes about his dirty business. The food he steals for himself often has worms crawling through it, so he must be quick when he picks it up, and when he gets home, he throws everything in the trash, because he isn’t sure that there is such a thing as clean food.

Toy Soldiers: War Stories

After a successful military career, Colonel Daxter is ready for the quiet life of a private citizen. However, when his sister is abducted by the military’s most notorious band of misfits, everything changes. Armed with unconventional weapons, the T-Buster Army makes their way into the city of Chicago, and Daxter is tasked with the mission of taking them down. He’s got friends who want him dead and a few secrets of his own, but Daxter isn’t about to let his little sister die while he’s trying to settle down and become a family man.

A Soldier of the Mist

“He had seen people like that before: people desperate for hope and something good to believe in. So desperate that they were willing to give up their dignity, the few things left to them, for the sake of those promises. They wanted to believe there was a place where a man could be free and true, where a person could be honest and free and strong without fear of punishment or reprisal. But such places didn’t exist. Men didn’t live in such ways. Never had.”

Eve White Eats Chocolate

Adam and his companion Eve have learned a good deal about the dangers of eating the right thing and the wrong thing. There are also some things that they won’t touch at all. But now, Eve has some information that might be helpful, so Adam agrees to take her to a bakery that claims to have eaten one hundred percent cocoa butter chocolate. Eve has an unhealthy fondness for it, and Adam hopes that she might have a change of heart and start eating her own food. However, when they get to the bakery, they discover something is off.

Chocolate is good, the shopkeeper says, but there is something different about it. It isn’t that it’s better than all the others. It’s not even that it tastes better than all the others. It’s something about the way it makes you feel. In fact, all of the things they’ve tried today have been just different enough, with just enough of a different feeling, that they’ve made good choices. But there is something special about this chocolate.

Daxter the Warrior

In a world where dogs are the enemies, the only hope for survival comes from a warrior named Daxter, who protects the kingdom from the ravenous beasts. When his mission is put in jeopardy, he is forced to choose between a life of solitude or a chance to live and love in the world. He must stand for what’s right, even if it means losing everything he loves.

Daxter the Warrior is a story about the choices you make when everything falls apart, a book about what happens when you’re forced to choose between your life and everything you love. When Daxter sees that his world is falling apart, he has to choose between living and dying, love and loneliness. But no one understands him, and he isn’t even sure that anyone in his kingdom even wants him around. Can he go back to being the only one that truly understands him? Can he give up everything he has ever known and start over?

The Dragon He Carried

There are very few things that can make a man feel important. Even fewer that make him feel whole. As a slave, he’d never understood how important a role his identity had played in his day to day existence until he was given the ability to see people, to make eye contact. There are no words that will explain to him how important that is. Even the way that he is treated by the most important person in his life makes him feel special and validated, even if it feels like all he does is sweep the floors of a mansion while waiting for death.

A Dragon Turns Down the Sun

As time passes and the world is still stuck in its endless cycle of conflict, the King of Mourning realizes that the only way out of this rut is to find a way to make his enemies hate him even more. What he doesn’t realize is that such a thing is impossible, or at least it was.

For the first time in many years, the King of Mourning is forced to face the possibility that he might be the cause of his own downfall, and perhaps his whole kingdom. He was never one to take pride in being a peaceful king who simply governed his people for their benefit, but the king was ready to fight for a cause and show the world that he was one of them. But they didn’t want him. Not in any way that mattered. Now he wonders if there’s a point in fighting any longer. Maybe it’s time to just give up and let the world run itself into ruin.

The Dragon Who Sleeps

The world is coming to an end, and it is all the fault of a dragon. It sounds like a fairy tale. It sounds like a fable. And it may be the only thing that saves the future.

The story of a young man who goes on a journey to find the only hope left in the world. At the time, he doesn’t know that it’s a dragon that brought about this new world, but he is going to have to find the source of it all if he wants to fix everything. There are two dragons who have taken residence in the mountains outside his home, and each is willing to accept him as their king.

The Dragon in the Dark

Everything is turning dark for the young king. His best friend is imprisoned and the people are turning against him. He’s only a young man with a lifetime of hard work ahead of him, but it looks like the world might just take that away from him as well. How will he survive in a world that has turned on him, and how will he survive if no one will even talk to him?

Fate of the Rebellion

In the world of The Dragon Who Sleeps, there is a group of young people trying to find their way in this land that is full of old prophecies and strange promises. The rebellion has a leader who claims to have answers, but can he even understand what it means to be human? There are some people who are willing to risk their lives and their livelihoods for the hope that the prophet might hold the answers they need. Others are willing to fight against the rebellion and see them die for trying to find peace. No matter how far the kingdom goes, no matter how much time passes, there will always be people who want to fight for peace and a world where all humans are given equal rights, but they will be the first to die for their beliefs if they are foolish enough to think they can change the world.

Daxter the Dark

Daxter the dark is a dark reimagining of the classic story of a man who must choose between loneliness and life itself. This is a story about a man who lives inside the castle walls with his family and the animals he trusts with his life. He is often left alone, even when the king is entertaining important guests from across the kingdom, but he is happy there, away from all the noise and conflicts of the outside world. His world is his refuge, his place of comfort, and he does his best to keep it from the world that would turn it into a prison. He has no intention of changing the world and ruining the life he has built for himself, so the only thing left for him to do is wait for death to take him.
