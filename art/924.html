I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things."  

"I could have got the same result if I had just done the right thing in 
the 
first place and set them up with ENA."  (Yeah right)

"That's precisely what I would have done."

"I don't want you to give them a new EOL number.  I want you to set them 
up for EOL 
with ENA.  Now, don't tell them anything and don't get them started on 
buying 
anything yet.  I think we should give it a couple of weeks before we 
tackle them 
again.  
I want them to know the name of the company all along.

You could be waiting all day.  This place is dead today."  (dead)  

"Thanks, I will head back there right after lunch."  (dead)

"This place is not going anywhere.  This is like a ghost town over here.  
Hey 
what's going on this afternoon?  Anything happening over there?"  (dead)

"You will probably find out that we have them set up.  Now keep your mouth 
shut 
and don't tell them they have a new EOL number.  I don't want to talk to 
them 
again until they are all ready to trade.  I don't want to give them a new 
EOL 
number, but what I can do is give them a new ISDA number and give them the 
same 
ISDA Master Agreement we have already signed and execute a novation.  That 
way 
everything stays the same.  Does that make sense?" (dead)

"Yeah, but, can we have the same people?" (dead)

"What people?" (dead)

"Those people who negotiated the Master Agreement." (dead)

"No, I will go over and talk to them." (dead)

"Thanks." (dead)

"You know I just wanted to see you. How are things going?" (dead)

"Not bad. I had a long talk with Mark. Now he is telling me everything is 
set up 
and ready to go. Have you gotten a name for the counterparty?" (dead)

"Yep. It is going to be ECT Investments." (dead)

"No, ECT Canada." (dead)

"That is wrong. What they are going to be doing this with is an ECT North 
America 
company. It is not on the list and you will see it is already being 
incorporated. 
That should not make a difference. I think we still need to talk to Scott 
tomorrow 
and you and I will have to do some explaining to him. He was under the 
impression 
that it was a Canadian company. It should not be that way.

We do not need to tell anyone anything about anything. That is why I think 
we 
should leave well enough alone." (dead)

"Yep, but I am a little nervous." (dead)

"Don't sweat it. Just do your job and they will do theirs. I think we can 
easily 
manage this. I don't think they will have any problems with ECT, and you 
don't have to 
meet with them." (dead)

"I know. That's why I was excited. I think they are going to like our price. 
The 
only thing I am worried about is ENA. What do we tell them? How do we 
handle this?" 
(dead)

"Don't worry about it. We can go in and explain it if we have to. I still 
think it 
will work itself out." (dead)

"That's what I was thinking." (dead)

"Thanks, Chris. I really appreciate it." (dead)

"Anytime." (dead)

I then hung up the phone and headed to lunch. I was hoping I had gotten 
through 
to him. He was in a good mood. Now, if he would just pass it on to someone 
that 
mattered.

I was going to go home and go to sleep, but I knew I needed to go to the 
office 
anyway, so I ended up driving over to Chris' new place of employment and 
dropping 
off a plant and office he had recently gotten. I hate walking around 
headquarters 
late at night, and it was late. I think I would walk with the devil to 
avoid 
doing that.

It was nice visiting with Chris before he went to bed and I said goodbye 
and 
made my way out.

I am not a violent person in any shape or form. I have, however, on several 
occasions, 
and very rarely, been in a situation where I could have physically taken 
another 
person's life. This was one of those instances, and I was angry. This was 
not 
meant as a threat, but as a promise. 

I looked at it this way. If Chris decided to screw me in my biggest 
deal/sale 
ever, then I would just come after him and kill him. I would be 
exonerated/released 
for doing it and would be able to write it off as an on the job killing. 
That is what 
I told myself that night and it seemed to satisfy my conscience.

The drive home was uneventful and by the time I got home I had calmed down 
and 
realized that this was the exact kind of thinking I was trying to get 
people to 
change. We needed to look at this as the opportunity of a lifetime and to 
make 
this deal happen not only for me, but for Chris and the whole team as 
well.

I finally decided that I was going to sleep and that I should really just 
plan on 
meeting with the team in the morning and hope for the best. 

I woke up the next morning and took my wife out to breakfast. We decided 
that we 
would go away for the long weekend, maybe to San Antonio, so we could get 
away 
from things for a little while. I called Mike and told him the good news 
and he 
seemed excited. I then decided to call Chris and let him know we were on 
for the 
deal at 10 AM. Chris sounded excited and I knew he would not miss this 
chance. 

We went to breakfast and made it back to the office in plenty of time. I 
went in 
and told Mike that things were going to start happening that day. He was 
very 
happy. We met with all the team and went through all of the documentation. 
Mike 
was definitely going to have his work cut out for him, but he seemed very 
prepared. 
Mike started arranging with the traders in the different groups to have 
preliminary 
trades entered to test the system. Mike, Chris and I all then met in the 
control 
center and walked through the functions of the system. It was working well. 
The 
system was sending a price update to the trade publication and an account 
update 
message to all of the customers who had either logged onto EOL or who had 
active 
transactions on EOL. We were getting all of the information over the wire 
and 
logged in the database. Everything looked great.

We then decided that since we had such an early start, it was a good 
idea to open 
the phone lines for those traders who had line one set up and wanted to 
test. 
This was definitely going to happen. I called everyone I knew in ECT and 
got 
them ready for this test. I then notified all of the traders in the ENA 
groups 
that they</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:12
