Imaging apparatuses such as digital still cameras generate pixel data used for generating image data for displaying a high-quality image. The pixel data may include noise caused by, for example, an amplifier circuit and the like in the imaging apparatus. There is also provided an imaging apparatus that reduces the noise included in the pixel data, in order to increase the quality of an image displayed in a display unit. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-338739 discloses a technique that detects an object within a frame image displayed on a display device, using a contrast detecting technique for generating and displaying an image in which a contrast value of the frame image has been adjusted. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2009-229633 discloses a technique that detects an object in an image, using a feature detecting technique for generating a histogram in a low frequency region and performing image processing.
There is provided an imaging apparatus capable of generating pixel data for generating an image to be displayed on a high-quality display unit, such as an LCD. However, the pixel data for displaying the high-quality image on the high-quality display unit does not include noise as much as compared with the pixel data used for generating an image to be displayed on an existing display unit. Therefore, a desired image cannot be displayed in the high-quality display unit.
The present disclosure has been made in view of the above, and it is an object thereof to provide an imaging apparatus capable of generating high-quality image data and a display unit capable of displaying a high-quality image using the generated image data.
An imaging apparatus according to an aspect of the present disclosure may include a light receiving section that receives an image of an object, a pixel data generating section that generates pixel data by performing arithmetic processing on the image received by the light receiving section, a memory that stores the generated pixel data, and a display control section that generates image data for displaying an image based on the generated pixel data. The pixel data generating section may generate the pixel data by performing image processing such as edge enhancing processing on the image received by the light receiving section. The image data generating section may generate the image data for displaying the image, based on the generated pixel data, and display the image based on the generated image data on a display unit. The display control section may set the image based on the generated pixel data as an image to be displayed on a high-quality display unit, and may display the image on the high-quality display unit by driving the high-quality display unit with a timing suitable for displaying the image on the high-quality display unit, based on the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit.
The imaging apparatus may further include a first determining section that determines whether or not the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit is a moving image, and a first updating section that updates the pixel data in accordance with the moving image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit. The display control section may generate an image to be displayed on a low-quality display unit, based on the pixel data updated by the first updating section. In the present disclosure, an image to be displayed on a low-quality display unit refers to an image to be displayed on an existing display unit.
The imaging apparatus may further include a second determining section that determines whether or not the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit is an image with a small area, and a second updating section that updates the pixel data in accordance with the image with a small area to be displayed on the high-quality display unit. The display control section may generate an image to be displayed on a low-quality display unit, based on the pixel data updated by the second updating section.
The imaging apparatus may further include a third determining section that determines whether or not the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit is an image with a small area, and a third updating section that updates the pixel data in accordance with the image with a small area to be displayed on the high-quality display unit. The display control section may generate an image to be displayed on a low-quality display unit, based on the pixel data updated by the third updating section.
The imaging apparatus may further include an edge image data generating section that generates an edge image by performing image processing such as edge enhancing processing on the image received by the light receiving section, and generates the image data for displaying the image on the high-quality display unit based on the generated edge image, and the display control section displays the image on the high-quality display unit based on the generated edge image on the high-quality display unit.
The imaging apparatus may further include a blurring section that blurs the edge image based on the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit, and the display control section displays the image on the high-quality display unit based on the image which has been blurred by the blurring section.
The imaging apparatus may further include an edge image blurring section that blurs the edge image based on the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit, and the display control section displays the image on the high-quality display unit based on the blurred edge image by the edge image blurring section.
The imaging apparatus may further include a color characteristic converting section that converts a color characteristic of the pixel data generated by the pixel data generating section, and generates an image data of a plurality of color components for displaying the image, which has been converted into a color characteristic that is substantially the same as a color characteristic of the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit. The display control section displays the image on the high-quality display unit based on the image which has been converted into the color characteristic that is substantially the same as the color characteristic of the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit.
The imaging apparatus may further include a pixel component determining section that determines a component of each pixel in a color image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit, and the display control section displays the image on the high-quality display unit based on a predetermined component of each pixel in the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit.
The imaging apparatus may further include a color characteristic converting section that converts a color characteristic of the pixel data generated by the pixel data generating section, and generates an image data of a plurality of color components for displaying the image, which has been converted into a color characteristic that is substantially the same as a color characteristic of the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit. The display control section displays the image on the high-quality display unit based on the image which has been converted into the color characteristic that is substantially the same as the color characteristic of the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit.
The imaging apparatus may further include a pixel component determining section that determines a component of each pixel in a color image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit, and the display control section displays the image on the high-quality display unit based on a predetermined component of each pixel in the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit.
The imaging apparatus may further include an RGBW data generating section that generates RGBW data by processing an RGB signal of an image based on a weighted addition ratio predetermined for each of a luminance component of the RGB signal and each of chrominance components of the RGB signal, and generates the image data of the plurality of color components for displaying the image, which has been converted into the color characteristic that is substantially the same as the color characteristic of the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit. The display control section displays the image on the high-quality display unit based on the image which has been converted into the color characteristic that is substantially the same as the color characteristic of the image to be displayed on the high-quality display unit.
