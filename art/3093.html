It Makes You Strong! The Love Me, I'm Weak Baby!" The lyrics, set to a hard rocking beat, are about "a woman who doesn't want to sleep with you when you get drunk, but wants to sleep with you when you're sober." They also feature the line: "Let's hear it for all the babes that will not make love to me when I'm drunk!" This is a track that had been around for several years. In 1976 the "Love Me, I'm Weak Baby" b/w "Let's Hear It for All the Babes That Will Not Make Love to Me When I'm Drunk" 45 was released. "Love Me, I'm Weak Baby" was an original song and "Let's Hear It for All the Babes That Will Not Make Love to Me When I'm Drunk" was an Al Green song from the 1966 album I'll Try Something New. I saw the Turtles play at a big outdoor concert at the Meadowbrook Bowl in Monticello, Illinois, in August of 1976 and thought "Love Me, I'm Weak Baby!" was terrific. They did a number of their older tunes in an interesting way.

"Don't Mess with a Tiger"

"Don't Mess with a Tiger" is yet another great live track from the 1970 album Reeling in the Years. This is another song in which the song title refers to a "tiger" but the main focus is on the "don't mess" aspect of the song's title. This is quite possibly one of the best songs of the entire Turtles discography. (Thanks to Bob Avey for pointing me to the original version of the clip below.)

You can read more about "Don't Mess with a Tiger" by clicking here: The Turtles' "Don't Mess with a Tiger" . I found the "Don't Mess with a Tiger" original version in the 1966 album Don't Mess With A Tiger by The Shondells. (This is the link to a clip of the song from YouTube). The Turtles version is much more interesting than the original.

"Tiger Eyes"

I've always been a fan of the Turtles' "Tiger Eyes." This 1966 song is another one that I was introduced to by another young artist. I saw Jimi Hendrix live at the Fox Theater in St. Louis on December 6th, 1970. A friend of mine knew Hendrix back in '66 when he was still with The Animals. We went to hear Hendrix at the Fox and afterward we went to visit my friend and his wife who was a big fan of the Turtles. She had them on her turntable and had all their albums including the Beatles' White Album which she had but hadn't gotten around to listening to. So she played "Tiger Eyes" and I liked the song's beat. The next day I made it a point to find the record. I had already heard their "You Showed Me" which I really liked. But "Tiger Eyes" was the standout track for me. It was one of those songs that had an interesting beat. Even though it was an original and was written by Jim Messina, it sounds like it could have been recorded in the '50s. It's not one of the most dynamic songs but it is not really lacking in anything. If you're an audiophile you'll want to check out the original.

There were several other Turtles songs that I have always liked. "It's Not Easy" from the band's 1969 Turtle Soup album always has been a great favorite of mine. And I had always loved the hard rockin' beat of "It Ain't Me Babe," "Let's Hang On," and "Happy Together" from their 1966 debut album The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands. But there are many other Turtles songs that I had forgotten. I discovered new ones with each pass through the albums. But I'm really happy with all the material I have found so far. I love their other songs and hope that they find their way into their set lists on future tours.

For me, the best things in life are the memories. I also have a fascination with nostalgia, music, and classic rock from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. This is where I would like to share my passion for discovering forgotten music gems and the nostalgia associated with them. I'm also happy to share cool pictures, pictures from my personal collection, and just cool pictures I come across in my wanderings in the Internet. I'll have some other things here too... And maybe you've got some pictures, music, or stories to share? Great! Send them to me and I'll be happy to include them in my blog. But please send it to: Pete Langis - RockandRollerChronicle@gmail.com I have been posting things here for about a year now so if I've missed something you've sent me I apologize. I'm also happy to post your comments. Or don't. It's all good. But do please share with your friends. Thanks. R&R.
