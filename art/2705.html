"There's an Escalade parked in the driveway of..." "That must be where they put him when he's not around." "You see, he likes being invisible." "Who?" "The guy who's inside." "You see, every two months he flies down to Colombia, gets two kilos of cocaine from his cousin... he pays off a guy up there named Ramirez." "Ramirez sells it for a million dollars a key." "A million?" "How much is that?" "And the cousin, he gets that back." "And what do you get?" "The girl he lets me have every week." "Did I mention that she's really good?" "And she does other things." "He calls me once a week to check if I'm still interested." "The first day I went to his house I was, like, what the hell is he doing here?" "But you don't have anything, so you go home." "I thought he was going to sell him out because he got scared... or he'd run out of money, but..." "I never thought it would end like this." "You need anything?" "Yeah." "I told you that you can't get attached to them." "I know." "I know." "I've been around that since I was a kid." "My advice:" "Find a girl that looks like your ex-wife." "Make her be the woman you want... then pretend that she's the one with the problem." "All you have to do is remember you don't have a problem anymore." "You're right." "As long as you remember it, you're cured." "Do you want to go for a walk?" "Okay." "When we first came out here..." "I tried to make a list of everything I didn't like about you." "It's pretty long, actually." "Did you know that I used to cry all night... after we did it, like, over you?" "No." "I used to think that you didn't like me." "I used to think you were ashamed of me." "I used to think I was a bad guy for giving you all the wrong ideas." "Now I think it was the opposite." "I think you were afraid of me... 'cause you knew I'd be better for you than you would ever be for yourself." "And the second we'd both realize that, we'd stop seeing each other." "Maybe one day we could go back." "Maybe." "Is that what we're doing here?" "What do you want, a commitment?" "Okay." "Here's the thing, you can pretend to be any kind of a woman you want... but I know who I am." "And you can only play that role with me." "I can't be what you want me to be." "I can't pretend to be over you or not think about you when I want to." "I can't play the role you want me to play." "You know, maybe I'm better for you than you ever were for yourself." "Or maybe I'm worse." "But it's too late now." "So I just hope that you can accept me for who I am... and eventually I hope you can accept me." "I'm sorry." "No, it's okay." "You know, I'm sorry." "I don't want to keep talking about it." "I don't want to be someone who has to apologize." "I don't want to be something that I don't want to be." "But I think I owe you an apology for something." "What?" "I never would have done what I did if I knew that you were in love with me." "You never used to like it when I said that." "But now I think I really do owe you an apology because... in my mind, I was always in love with you." "So, I'm sorry." "I'm sorry I always blew you off." "I'm sorry that I never gave you enough of a chance." "I don't think we have to have an ending." "This can be our ending." "You know?" "Good night, Ryan." "You've got to do it in your head." "Make it a game." "You've got to pretend that you're not afraid of the outcome." "Have to remind yourself that... you can't actually die." "That this is only a pretend thing." "Don't wanna end up on some operating table." "Saw my mom there once." "Watched them bring her back." "Didn't die, but... they made her not even like a person anymore." "Well, that's not going to happen to us." "Not on my watch." "Okay?" "What if we don't do it, right here?" "What if we just end up someplace else?" "Where we go doesn't matter." "There's no escaping it, really." "In a year... in a decade... at the latest." "It's gonna catch up with us, you know?" "It always does." "Do you really want to do that?" "I think that I do." "I like you." "Ryan, this is Ryan." "Can you hear me?" "Can you hear me?" "Hello?" "He's here." "Where?" "Is he in?" "Is that Ryan?" "Yes." "Where are you?" "I'm not..." "Don't look outside, just look straight at him." "Okay." "Okay." "I'm sorry." "Ryan, everything's gonna be okay." "He has to die with me, okay?" "He has to die with me." "You want him to kill you?" "Yeah." "Okay." "But I don't want him to die because of me." "You have to do it." "Hello?" "I can see you now." "Yeah." "Okay, yeah, that's good." "Okay, okay, okay." "Hey, hey!" "Don't make me ask twice, dude." "How many rounds you got?" "Oh." "Okay." "That'll do it." "Hey, hey, hey, hey!" "Hey, I want to talk to you." "Okay." "Let's talk this thing through." "I mean..." "let's talk like two adults, okay?" "I know you want her to live." "I know that you'd rather have her die a whole lot more than die yourself." "But it doesn't mean that you're not a person." "You're more than a person, but you're a human being." "But you gotta realize this is her last hope." "It's her only hope." "If she kills herself, she's gone." "But if she wants to live..." "There's a chance for you to get her to go to rehab or a halfway house... instead of just being a fuckin' lunatic on the streets for the rest of your life." "There's a chance for you both to have something good." "You know, I think I can help you and help her, but you can't do it without me." "What do you say?" "Hello, Dad?" "Hi, it's Ryan." "I know it's been a long time, but I just wanted to call you... and tell you that I was sorry for the way I've been living." "I've been thinking about you a lot." "And I wanted to say that I hope you can forgive me." "Okay." "I don't want to die today." "I really don't want to die today." "You're gonna shoot me, aren't you?" "I don't want to." "Well, you are." "I think you should let me live." "I'll tell you what I'm gonna do." "I'm gonna give you a time out." "You're gonna go stand over there and think about why you want to shoot me." "You've got ten seconds." "Ten seconds is up." "I don't know if you're still there, but I don't really have a choice." "It's time." "Hello?" "No!" "No!" "Shoot me!" "Shoot me!" "My God." "I'll shoot you if you don't shoot me, Ryan." "Where are you?" "Can you see me?" "I'm right here." "You're going to have to do this." "Do what?" "If you don't kill him, I will." "He doesn't deserve to live." "If I was you, I'd just do it." "We're both gonna do it." "Two for one." "It's cheaper." "Don't!" "Don't!" "Do it." "Don't." "Don't." "You're okay." "You're okay." "Now can you see me?" "Ryan, we're going to go see your dad, okay?" "What?" "Okay." "Are you ready?" "It's beautiful." "It's beautiful." "You ready?" "Let's go." "Do you want to go in, Ryan?" "Thanks for doing this, man."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:56
