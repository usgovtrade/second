CHAPTER XIX.

A RAINY DAY.


But the boys had forgotten all about this trifling matter when they found themselves in
the open air again.

"I guess we'd better let them go," laughed Bob, as he looked at the boys on the roof.

The big policeman nodded, and walked away whistling.

As they were starting for home the sky began to look rather cloudy.

"This rain will spoil everything," complained Tom, as a few large drops fell.

"I'm going to keep my umbrellas, anyhow," said Bob, as he got out the big
green one he always carried in the boat.

"No use," said Nat, "it's coming down in sheets."

And it did, in truth.

The rain came down so hard that it seemed as though some one was taking a great hand
sponge and squeezing it against the sidewalk.

The boys, in their haste to get under the arc lights, did not look up and see the drops
as they fell. But, had they done so, I am sure it would have made them turn around and
run back to the boat-house.

There was no shelter there. Only a roof for the boat-house, which kept the rain off for a
short distance, but not enough to keep the boys dry.

It was not long before their clothes were soaked, and their shoes filled with water. And
Nat, not being used to such rains, became very chilly and began to feel ill.

Just as they were getting back at the boat-house, the rain ceased as suddenly as it had
begun.

The boys looked at one another, open-mouthed.

"Do you think that was a drop?" said Nat, with a shudder.

"I don't care what it was," said Tom, who, like Nat, was shivering. "I'd hate to
be caught in one of those big lakes with nothing but our rubber coats. I think it must be
ten degrees below zero, as near as I can tell. I'm all wet and cold and my shoes are heavy
as lead."

"I know what you want," said Bob, slowly.

"I bet you can guess that, can't you?" said Nat, grinning.

"Well, I've got it," said Bob. "We'll take off our shoes and socks."

"And then we can stay in the car," said Nat. "But let's get under those big lights
and get out of the wet wind."

And, while the rain still poured down, the boys were given a warm bath in the
comfortable car. Then, being warmer and dry, they felt better.

"Aha!" said Bob, "here comes a taxi."

The two boys were soon in the taxi, and in a few minutes were at home, thoroughly
warmed up by the great fire that was burning brightly.

A hot cup of tea, and some toast, completed their recovery.

A hot bath, and a change of clothes, followed, and the boys felt well and strong again.

They started out just in time to catch the last run of the trains from Hagenbeck Park to
Marienbad. The next day, tired out by their long trip, the boys slept well. And they
enjoyed a good time in Marienbad, where the first thing they did was to get the mud-pies
and ice-cream they had promised their Aunt Josephine.

After that they went to the Zoological Garden and saw the animals.

Then, when their day's trip was done, and they had said good-bye to the hotel, the boys
set out for the lake again.

This time they were going to see what would happen to the _Crescent_ in a big storm.

The storm of the night before was rather bad fun for them. But there was no comparison to
what they had to face on this morning.

The rain came down in such torrents that Bob at last gave up the idea of sailing the
_Arrow_ and suggested that he and Nat should row the _Crescent_ to the lake.

"I'm sure it's better to keep close to land in a blow like this," he said, "and the
boat won't go away from us."

Nat took his advice, but the rain went on pouring down until the lake, usually a sheet of
clear, blue water, looked as though it had been colored by a blue bottle.

Nat soon changed his opinion of the _Crescent_ under such conditions, and
concluded that he could not have a better time anywhere else.

Bob worked the sails, while Nat rowed. And as Bob had never done the latter before, he
was soon panting for breath.

"Don't take on so, Bob," said Nat. "You'll be all right when you get into the
_Crescent_."

"I'm not going in the _Crescent_," said Bob. "You'll have to tow me in. I'm not
going to go out there in the lake without any wind at all. It would be worse than a fall
out of a balloon."

And so Bob stayed in the boat, and Nat towed him ashore.

"Well," said Nat, "do you think you'd care to try rowing the _Crescent_ back
again?"

"No!" answered Bob, promptly. "I wouldn't trust myself in that craft again. Why, the
waves on her will smash me against the side like a ball on a paddle-wheel."

"What'll we do?" asked Nat.

"We've got to get the _Arrow_ back," answered Bob, promptly. "It's our
responsibility to get our boat home."

"And how'll we do that?" asked Nat.

"Well, I don't know, I'm sure. We can't have a sail out here without getting on to the
boat. How are we going to get back?"

"I'm sure I don't know," said Nat. "Do you want to land again and take a trip?"

"I think not. The lake looks like a little sea," answered Bob. "I'd rather just paddle
along with you."

"I'll help," volunteered Nat.

Bob could hardly find it in his heart to refuse such a generous offer, and so the boys
began to paddle toward the pier. Bob found it a much easier task than rowing, and he soon
joined in the conversation. Nat told him all about their trip, and how his father had got
their boat away from the beach where they had left it.

"Did you see that new boat?" asked Nat. "What kind of a one is it?"

"Oh, a boat you had all to yourself," said Bob. "I guess that one's a real beauty."

"It is, I tell you," said Nat. "If we can only get our boat, what a great trip we
could have!"

"I guess we'll get it," said Bob.

"Of course we will," said Nat. "I hope we don't have any other trouble getting it
home."

"It's not a pretty sight, I can tell you," said Bob, when he had told Nat about the
accident to Mr. Green.

"But how do you know it was a boat?" asked Nat. "Maybe it wasn't."

"Well, if it wasn't, it's a funny thing," said Bob. "Because I saw it in the water, and
something about it must have looked like a boat. It was a pretty heavy thing, too, to have
fallen out of the sky."

They had no further adventures on their way to the _Arrow_ landing. Nat showed Bob
the place where they had their lunch on the bank of the river.

When they arrived there Nat said: "Did you notice anything peculiar about that place?"

"Well," answered Bob, "it was an awfully windy day to lunch."

"Not to anybody," answered Nat, promptly. "I was up there once or twice. Look at the
trees on that bank. Do you notice anything queer about them? They're all crooked, and the
place is all littered with their branches. And as far as I know, the wind does not ever
blow there. A breeze like that comes up the river."

"You're right, then," said Bob. "And there was a boat there. I didn't notice it,
for I was busy with the boat at the time, but I saw something floating about where we had
our luncheon."

"I believe it was that boat," said Nat. "Did you hear anything when you went up
there after we were knocked out of the boat?"

"No, it wasn't</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:39
