seriously considering this plan.  I haven't even considered that I'd want 
the option.  It sounds completely depressing to me.  And actually the whole 
seduction and sex with my husband at 50 kind of gets me on a roll.  Is that 
the goal here, I'm trying to make him want me or is it something about 
sharing a bathroom that makes him think twice?   Sounds like a bit of a 
roller coaster to me.

My vote - buy a small dog.  Or a cat.  

You should try the puppy play in the office in the afternoon.  Makes for an 
interesting hour or so.

Talk to you soon.

My life is a roller coaster ride as you know.  It is up and down like crazy.
I'll tell you what, it sounds like something that I would be into, but my 
husband would probably kill me.

Do you think you could ever do that and keep it a secret, or would everybody 
find out and make fun of you?  Just wondering...

I miss you TOO!!  I can't wait until you get back in town.

The following information comes from an urban legend website that my friend 
and I found on the internet.  I just wanted to share this with you - it's a 
little strange, yet interesting. 

Have a good day!

Love and Mr. Miller

One afternoon a man was in bed with his wife when Mr. Miller, the 
neighbor, knocked on the
door and asked if he could use their bathroom.  "Sure,"  Mr. and Mrs. Miller 
said.  "Be our guest."
Mr. Miller went into the bathroom and closed the door.  He then went into 
the closet, got a 12-pack of beer,
came back into the bathroom and handed them to his wife.  He then got into 
the shower.

Mr. and Mrs. Miller were enjoying a cold one when the doorbell rang.   Mrs. 
Miller opened the door and found Mr. 
Mathews on the porch.  He said, "I'm sorry to disturb you, but I think your 
house is on fire."
"What?" said Mrs. Miller. "Turn on the TV," Mr. Miller said. So Mrs. Miller 
sat down on the sofa with 
the beer and started watching TV. Mr. Miller got out of the shower, toweled 
off and joined his wife on the 
sofa. 
Soon, all of the fire trucks were at the house and the firemen were walking 
up Mrs. Miller's driveway.
After they knocked for several minutes, Mr. Miller asked the fireman if they 
had gotten the message. 
"What message?" said the fireman. "We were told that if we wanted the 
firehouse to visit, to leave 
this beer out for them." Mrs. Miller pointed to the beer in the man's hand, 
"I guess they got your message," she 
said.

Mr. Miller is also having problems with his girlfriend. He was explaining to 
a friend how his 
girlfriend is always nagging him about the house being a mess, how she never 
does anything to help around 
the house and blah, blah, blah.  His friend said, "You know, if she doesn't 
like it, why don't you just leave?"

Mr. Miller went home and the next day his girlfriend came over to watch a 
movie with him. As they started 
to kiss, Mr. Miller asked his girlfriend where she wanted him to sit. She 
said, "I don't care, I don't feel like 
being nagged about housework tonight." 
Said Mr. Miller, "Okay. I won't." So they went ahead and made love. About 30 
minutes later Mr. Miller sat 
up and said, "I feel a little nagged." 
"Yeah," his girlfriend said, "you've been nagged all your life, now get used 
to it."


"Well," said Mr. Miller. "Which do you want me to do first, the dishes or 
take out the garbage?"</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:50
