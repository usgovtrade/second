"I have loved you from the moment I saw you." "And when you leave, when we take that plane to New York I am going to miss you." "Mae?" "Ethan." "Oh, hi." "Hi." " Hey, I wanted to give you my address to send those flowers." " Oh, yeah." " Yeah." " I actually already did." " Oh, okay." " Oh, are you staying in town?" " No, we're going on a honeymoon." " Oh, wow." " Yeah." "That sounds great." " You're married." " So are you." "Yeah, it's crazy, huh?" "I feel like I've been waiting for you for so long." "I know you have, and I'm sorry I didn't find you sooner." "Yeah, I'm sorry too." "Oh, well." "I better get going before Maddie comes back." " Yeah, before Maddie comes back." " How..." "How did you even..." "Thank you." "Okay, bye." "Bye." "Bye." "Okay." "That went well." "You know that's the only thing that's happened between me and one of my cousins that went well in my entire life." " Hey, baby." " Hey." " How was the wedding?" " Beautiful." " What are you doing here?" " Just came by to check on you." "See how the honeymoon was going." "Aw." "Well, I'll let you go check on that." "I'm gonna go take a shower." " Okay." "So?" " Hey." "Hi." "What?" " I'm so tired of you going to the bathroom." " It's just a few times." "It's every time we get a chance to have some privacy." "It's..." "A lot of things would have to change for me to go out and just grab dinner." "So, what's your point?" " It just made me jealous, seeing you with him." " That's ridiculous." "He's your husband, he's not mine." "I know." "It's just you guys have been together for a really long time." "You know, just because you and I haven't been together for that long doesn't mean that we can't last." "Doesn't mean that I wouldn't want to last." "Okay, please stop." "Oh, I'm sorry." "I don't want to talk about this, not about your wedding." " Well, it's my honeymoon." " What?" "Do you still love him?" "Look, it's not about us right now." "I don't get it." "Look, we've both done the long-distance thing but I don't think that we are meant to be apart for a long time." "And I can't just stay here without you." "I can't just sit here alone." "Without you." "Yes, you can." "Look, you've got to trust me." "It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life." "And I think it's the hardest thing you've ever done too." "We are meant to be together." "This is going to be the longest year of my life." "I'm not gonna let anything or anyone come between us." "Ever." "Wait." "I think you have the wrong key." "I'm very sorry for everything." "I love you." "Okay." "All right." "We should get going if we're gonna make that flight." " Right." "Yeah, I'll just..." "I'm sorry." "I..." " No, it's okay." "Okay." "We still need a few things." "Just hurry." "So we're gonna go." "Are you ready?" "Yes, I'm ready." "We are going to New York." "Hey." "I forgot how big you are." "Stop it." "Hey, come on." "What?" "You have a bag." "So do you." "Okay." "I'll call you." "Wait, Maddie." "Maddie." "Oh, my God." " Oh, my God." "Okay." " Are you okay?" "Yes." "Oh, my God." "All right." "I'll call you when I land." " Promise me." " Yeah." "Maddie, I promise." "Okay." "I'll see you soon." " Okay, see you." "See you, guys." " Bye." "Take care, okay?" "I will." "Bye." "She just came to the airport in L.A. I have no idea why she came to the airport." " We are going to New York." " We are going to New York." "You're really beautiful." "And I didn't understand for so long." "But I get it." "I get it now." "I know you miss her." "I know you miss him." "That's okay." "That's okay." "It's a hard, empty feeling." "And you're feeling alone." "And you're not used to it yet." "You're not used to being without him." "But you will be." "You're gonna be okay." "Yeah." "Thank you." "You ready?" "Yeah." "I don't know if we should do this." "What?" "Well, I just..." "I don't know." "It seems kind of insane." "Okay, then..." "We can..." "If you don't want to do it, you don't have to." "You know what?" "You're absolutely right." "It's insane." "Yes, this is a bad idea." " This is a terrible idea." " I mean, just look at the D.L." "You know, we should just forget it." "Okay, you know what?" "I will go home and I will tell him that I changed my mind." "Okay?" "I've been waiting for a guy like you my whole life." "Mae, we are doing this." "You're getting married." " I am getting married." "I'm getting married." "I'm getting married." "Okay, you know what?" "There are moments in life when you know everything is gonna change." "This is one of those moments." "It is." "No matter what, we are gonna be friends." "How we handle it from this point on is what's important, okay?" "And you are right, it is insane." " It is insane." " We are insane." "Thank you." "So what do we do?" "We're gonna have to figure it out." "The flight to New York leaves in two hours." "If we run there fast, we can make it." "Okay?" "Let's go." "Let's run." "Are you ready?" "Are you ready?" "Yeah." " All right, let's go." "Let's run." " Let's run." "Let's run." "Go, go, go." "No, no, wait." "Wait, wait, wait, wait." "Go to the fountain, go to the fountain." "Have you seen Henry?" "Henry, have you seen Henry?" "I don't know where he went." "Hey, wait, wait." "Henry." " Henry." "Henry?" " Have you seen Henry?" "Hey, we're getting married today." "You're the one missing the party." "Where you going?" "Be back in a few minutes, ma'am." "I'm just gonna deal with a crisis." "I'll be right back." "No, no." "Look, there's no time for you to deal with a crisis." "We have to get you married." "Excuse me." "Sorry." "Excuse me." "Sorry." "Excuse me." "Sorry." "Oh, my God." "Oh, my God." "Oh, my God." "What is happening?" "What is happening?" "Yeah?" "What's happening is we're gonna miss our plane, Ethan." "Well, we'll catch the next one." "I am so sorry." "We're not gonna make it to the wedding and now we have to call the whole wedding off." "We have to go back." "Okay, we don't have to go back." "No, no, no." "What about the wedding?" " What about the wedding?" " That was the whole point." "I don't even know what point you're trying to make right now." " I'm gonna tell her the truth." " No, you're not." "Tell her whatever you want, I'm telling her the truth." "Please don't smoke in here." "I'm begging you." "I can't have it in here." "Smoke bothers me." "Well, then don't breath." "That's not the point." "What is the point?" "I'm trying to explain something to you here, something really amazing and I wanted to include you in this amazingness with me, but you have to be on board." "This is us, all right?" "We're like a team." "Do I look like I'm on board?" "Look at me." "You're right." "I'm not on board." "You want me to be on board?" "Then tell me something that I can be on board with." "Okay, fine." " We are about to miss the wedding of your dreams." " Okay." "And you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:56
