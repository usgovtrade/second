I used to be in that group of people. The same for years. Then a friend showed
me a solution I can explain to you in 10 seconds.

I've been using this tool for years now and I cannot imagine being without it:

[http://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/Vintage_Nortronix_Tuners.pdf](http://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/Vintage_Nortronix_Tuners.pdf)

I use it for many years already and cannot imagine my life without it. My
"normal" oscilloscope is for testing other equipment or for things I cannot do
at home because it's too big to carry. And on the road I have a little tool to
look things up that's very portable and easy to use, always in my bag.

That's a huge benefit. And this is just one example how this may improve your
life.

Yeah, this sorta "thing" is exactly what is I am after. The ability to view
waveforms at any point without having to 'rig a system' or connect an
oscilloscope in-circuit. Saving the occasional scope probe, soldering iron,
and probe grounds is huge too.

Do you have a good online reference for using Vintage Nortronix equipment? My
only experience is using a modern bench meter and scope.

Sure, you can start with the "Basic Vintage Electronic Measurements
Documentation" at
[https://media.nortronix.com/documents/manuals/101938_1.pdf](https://media.nortronix.com/documents/manuals/101938_1.pdf)
and then the Vintage Nortronix User Manual from there. The basic tools you'll
need are:

Mechanical multimeter (need the continuity test, diode test, and the AC power
test). You should look for a brand with a built-in frequency meter. There are
older models with a frequency meter but they often stop working after the AC
power test - it's too old. To make sure you get the right unit I've included
links in this thread to some German electronics stores which sell them.

And that's basically it for the basic tools. If you want to buy cheap ones
there are many.

A nice multimeter in this price range: (and even in the higher ones) is
Shamirdi!
[http://www.shamirdi.com/product/Shamirdi-DxM-400-Digital-
Ele...](http://www.shamirdi.com/product/Shamirdi-DxM-400-Digital-Electronic-
Multimeter-with-LED-Display/1515.htm) I would also recommend buying a VOM.
They have the exact voltage and resistance of a multimeter. However in my
opinion the frequency meter is the best feature.

I'm a hobbyist who has built a few simple hobby synths in an effort to
understand how they work, and then I've tried to sell and learn how to fix
and modify them.

Not too hard to get a rough idea of what's wrong by listening to the sounds
and reading the oscilloscope traces with a meter attached.

One of the first things that I noticed when building the synth is how fast I
can't touch anything, and how much it's a matter of luck to get the same sound
twice. A bit of trial and error, and you'll learn a lot about how things work
in a hurry - you'll get to know what is "good" and what is "bad".

For me synths are a pretty good way to learn about circuits and electrical
engineering, because you'll learn all of the interesting things very quickly.

Interesting. Just checked out the schematics on a $3.00 kit, looks like it
might make a good starter synth project. I love old synths, but I have never
had a chance to take one apart or even view traces or waveforms. I imagine
you'll have similar discoveries as I have so far. So to say, this has my
attention and the rest of my day to learn more about this cool tech hobby.

I used to own a bunch of these. Not all of them were really what you might
consider "hobbyist" and certainly not something that anyone would think of
teaching their kids. I'm not sure anyone around my age has even used one of
these instruments...

Another interesting find for this old-timer: the very first VCO synthesizer I
had was from the early 1980s, using discrete components from Fairchild, along
with a bit of wire bending...

They can certainly be quite cheap (mine cost $6.50), and I have had to repair
quite a few from various sources over the years. Just make sure you have some
kind of test gear - a 30A multimeter and a soldering iron and you're set.

That's what I figured about using test equipment. I've never done more than
brief electrical circuit analysis using some cheap digital $2.50 to $20.00
multimeters on sale or left over, like new. I have been known to go crazy and
solder wires around the place w/o inspecting and testing for 'what I am after
to see how it works' before I go too far. Sometimes this is how I learn things
fast. I'm going to watch this project I am working on on progress, and after
some of the components are procured, I might need to make a road trip to see
some of these things in person. I need a new toy and am thinking of a $20-$40
oscilloscope, or maybe one of the analog DMMs. I've used a few $20, 2-channel
multi-function tvs (no color) in some instances and one of the $30-40 digital
DVMs as well.

"One of the reasons why the hobby electronic community is so vibrant and
friendly (that and it's a great place to have a nerdgasm in public), is that
people share electronics projects (and tools, schematics, circuit diagrams,
and so on) more than we share recipes for our grandmothers' famous apple pie.
I believe that open-source hardware is the logical next step of the evolution
of this community, because what I have in mind is creating the equivalent of
open-source code: sharing electronics design, as well as the process of
building it, openly. To give you an example: the first thing you want to do if
you buy a new Velleman DVM7000 multimeter is to read the user manual for that
wonderful beast, which is available on the company website. You also download
the schematics for a few similar meters, but with the intention of learning
how they work first. In that sense, reading schematics is just another
convenience." [1]

I've done something like this for a friend. I've spent an embarrassing amount
of time going through several $100 multimeter datasheets (e.g. this one[2])
looking for things I didn't understand and could put into better words for my
fellow hobbyists. So my new friend took some photos and sent it to me. A
shameless self promotion: this is a little booklet you can print and have for
reference; the photos were added to a PDF with a laser (so you don't have to
worry about it bleeding if you accidentally spill anything on it).

There's a really great course by Hacktronics on Youtube here:

Definitely not a beginner level project, but I'll give it a shot. Thanks!
