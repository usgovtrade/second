The invention relates to a method of fabricating a liquid ejection head for ejecting a liquid from a nozzle and a liquid ejection head.
2. Related Art
Conventionally, there is a liquid ejection head which includes a nozzle face on which a plurality of nozzles ejecting an ink in a straight line are arranged in a row, and which has a function of aligning a plurality of liquid columns, which are formed by laminating a plurality of plates for forming the nozzle face, in such a way that a central axes of the liquid columns are aligned to each other (for example, see JP-A-2004-138810). Such a liquid ejection head includes a dummy pattern (dummy section) extending in an arrangement direction of the nozzles (in a width direction of the nozzle face) in the area around the plurality of nozzles on the nozzle face, and thus it is possible to align the plurality of liquid columns in such a way that the central axes of the liquid columns are aligned to each other on the basis of the dummy pattern.
However, the plurality of liquid columns which are aligned in such a way that the central axes thereof are aligned to each other are not necessarily formed in a state where the heights thereof are uniform. For example, in the case where the nozzle face is formed by stacking two plates, if there is a difference in height between the two plates, a difference in height may be generated between the liquid columns formed between the two plates and the liquid columns on the upper side thereof. In this case, there is a concern that an ejection error (deviation) of an ink may occur between a liquid column on the upper side and a liquid column on the lower side of the stacked nozzles. In view of this, in the method disclosed in JP-A-2004-138810, there is a problem that it is not possible to reliably align the liquid columns formed of the stacked plates in such a way that the central axes thereof are aligned to each other.
In addition, since a dummy pattern is formed of a metal layer, there is a problem that it is not possible to print a liquid repellent film in the dummy section. As a result, if the liquid columns are not adequately aligned, there may be a possibility that there is an ejection error of a liquid. In view of this, in JP-A-2004-138810, there is also a problem that if the liquid repellent film is not printed in the dummy section, it is not possible to reliably align the liquid columns formed of the stacked plates in such a way that the central axes thereof are aligned to each other.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:55
