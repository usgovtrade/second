Other works
In the book The Anatomy of Story, Campbell makes the following remark:

"In all my work with screenplays, directors and actors, I have discovered that it is relatively easy to make a film about things which are 'good' or 'evil'. What is much more difficult is to make a film which deals with, which presents, those great conflicts of life which are at once meaningful and unresolved."

Campbell and some of his contemporaries created the television series Earth: Final Conflict, but Campbell refused to write for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. He said he wanted his storylines to be more philosophical in nature. This was the cause of his conflict with Gene Roddenberry who fired him after seven episodes. Also on DS9, Campbell was credited as "consulting producer".

After working as a consultant on the X-Files, Campbell created the miniseries Taken, which lasted only one season. This has been seen by some as his response to his firing from Deep Space Nine, and was his last credit at Star Trek, prior to his death.

In 1995, Campbell, along with science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, created a new science fiction TV show called Babylon 5. It aired for five years and was known for its realistic approach to portraying its aliens. Campbell served as co-producer. He worked with B5 for six years. During the last two years, he was given very limited access to the production of the show.

Death
Campbell died of a heart attack at his home in Los Angeles on September 28, 2004. He was 65 years old.

Legacy
Many consider him one of the best science fiction writers ever; his work in particular is thought to be ground-breaking, especially in the field of science fiction. Campbell was an early advocate of using fictional stories for making social statements, and was influential in the field of speculative fiction in particular for that reason.

In 1993, Campbell was given the Special Grand Master Nebula Award. In addition to his SF novels, his short fiction was collected in The Best of William Tenn (1960) and The Worlds of Poul Anderson and Gordon Dickson (1983). His most recent collection, Blood Lite, includes ten short stories.

A portion of his archive was donated to his alma mater, Carnegie Mellon University in 2005.

Campbell is featured as one of the "characters" in Neil Gaiman's short story "Pygmalion" from the book Smoke & Mirrors. In the story, Campbell is writing a story involving his wife Jean and himself. It is a retelling of his life as he tells it to her in an almost Shakespearean style.

In 2006, his short story "A Sense of the Past" was made into a short film by the Australian company, Anticipation Films. In "A Sense of the Past," a young male character tells a story of two fictional men who come to earth from the future and who, despite their technology and high intelligence, are unable to function in a human society. Their plight is due to a loss of some quality (their names are not used) that human males on this planet rely upon in order to function.

His collection Blood Lite was adapted as a Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode called "Shadows of P'Jem" by executive producer Ira Steven Behr.
