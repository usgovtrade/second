The game features clips from the episode as well as clips from other episodes. 

Reception
On the whole, however, the reviews were negative, with Time praising the new game, but also calling into question the show's ongoing appeal, stating that "You don't have to be a fan of the show to enjoy this experience, but you do have to like jokes that depend on being able to laugh at the misfortunes of an unfortunate soul with the unfortunate name of 'Pick a Castaway'."
