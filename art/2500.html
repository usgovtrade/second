I have no idea of who this "Mid-Fight Refueling Technique" is, but I would like to try the second "trick" he talks about here:

But, to be honest, I couldn't find it in either the book, The Unbreakable Middleweight Boxing Champion, nor any other source. There is a trick shown by this "fighter", where he is using a bag, and he's doing that strange maneuver you see above.
The Question:
What is he trying to demonstrate? I understand his explanation, but the video isn't exactly of a technique being demonstrated. It's of a technique being explained.

A:

I think this is simply a variation of the shoulder roll, except instead of "rolling" it across your body, you're "rolling" it upwards. The purpose being to give you less of a target area for your opponent to hit, and make it easier to keep your balance (especially if you're on your back).

A:

I believe it is a variant on the spinning back-pedal (or back-roll), to keep you in front of your opponent without exposing a large part of your body. 
I remember a very old-school boxing video from the 1950s that showed a similar move in the same context as you have in the video. The video went as far back as the 1950s but I can't find it right now. There was also an old video by a boxer who came up with this move, called "the spinbacker". You can see it in the 1970's or 1980's films, like The Last Fight, Rocky V, "The Hitman". Or watch one of his fight tapes from the 1950's to see what I mean. 
Here is a decent one of the spinbacker:

If you do a search on youtube you will also see some very good videos on how to do this move with this video from a 1980's fight called "Midfight Refueling Technique" for a more modern example:

Here is an example of spinning back-pedal/back-roll. 

Some examples of the spinbacker are here and here. 
It was a famous old-school technique in the last part of the 20th century. 
I have seen it on a few tapes and in films in boxing from the late 1970s to early 1990s. And the move is also known from old Kung-fu movies, but not very common. The trick is to get your body turned inside out, which is very hard, because as your body gets turned your opponent gets to you and your body turns inside out (spinning), which can work against you. So you have to be very strong to perform this move. It is very hard to do well in training, so you have to get some training tips for it, but it is quite spectacular. 

A:

The Mid-fight refueling is not some sort of a move, it is the name of the technique that is used when you are about to do a heavy duty move. You just move your body to the back, and by spinning your body you put yourself in the perfect position to hit the opponent. But as stated, this has nothing to do with your opponent hitting you, but more about putting yourself in the best position for you to go for your move.

A:

This is a version of the spin back.  See for example the video "In the spin back".
It's a difficult move to do and it takes some practice, but it's useful to use when you can't move around much and need to stay behind your opponent.

Also, a tip: You can hit your opponent with your elbow while you spin in the air. This will knock your opponent over and will give you a moment to regain balance.

You can practice it on your back by rolling on the ground. 

If you are not familiar with the drill, I found an online video that shows some steps to make the right form.
