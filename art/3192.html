Giving informed consent, communication and compassion at the end of life are difficult to achieve. The growing trend towards the publication of 'life-like' photographs on the Internet is of concern to those caring for dying patients, who see this 'disturbing portrayal' of the dying body in a form they cannot avoid. This article critically reviews the literature about photographs at the end of life to explore what we know about how patients see themselves, their families and bystanders viewing this documentation. Research methods, with a particular focus on systematic review, were used. Findings were assessed through thematic analysis. There is a paucity of studies in this area and what is available does not represent patients, their families and other viewers well. Patients, when well and ill, and families feel they are portrayed incorrectly, with inappropriate language used. Images that portray the dying body in isolation, close-ups, or in a context of 'disturbing intimacy', are problematic. There is also an indication that the public viewing may lead to a form of dehumanization of the dying patient, with the 'end of life' being considered 'the end of a problem'. The data indicate that in this context, 'end of life photography' may serve to distance family and others from the patient and their needs. Clinicians and policymakers need to work together to promote the appropriate use of 'end of life photography' in healthcare in order to deliver the care we all desire at the end of our lives.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:43
