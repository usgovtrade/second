It only takes a few minutes to make your own, and you get the satisfaction of knowing exactly what you’re feeding your chia pets.

Here’s how to make them:

You can buy pre-made chia pots or use mason jars.

Add 1 teaspoon of organic, raw honey to every ½ cup of chia seeds.

Add 3 cups of water.

Stir thoroughly.

Place in the sun for about 5 hours or in the shade overnight.

Allow the seeds to soak up the water.

Remove from the jar.

Pour 1 to 2 inches of water into the bowl (making sure it’s only a few inches deep).

Stir the chia seeds with the honey so they’re coated. Place the seeds on top of the water and let them absorb the water as it seeps in.

Serve at room temperature.

Repeat the process every other day. You may need to add more water.

After a week, you’ll have a plant on your hands.

5. Almond butter cookies

Adding protein to your rabbit’s diet is a perfect way to improve their immune system and overall health. Protein helps give their muscles the nutrients they need to stay healthy, and helps maintain healthy bones.

You can serve your rabbit a healthy snack of almond butter cookies at any time, but the ingredients are best if eaten on a regular basis. You can make these cookies at any time of the year, and they won’t go bad. Simply add them to their kibble or mix them into their food bowl.

Here’s how to make them:

Put 3 tablespoons of almond butter into a mixing bowl.

Add 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of honey or brown sugar. Stir well.

Mix in the flour and salt until well combined.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Beat the butter and sugar until smooth. Add the almond butter. Mix well.

Add the baking soda, vinegar, vanilla extract, and coconut oil to the mixture. Mix well.

Put the mixture into a greased baking dish. Spread it out evenly.

Bake for 15 minutes or until golden.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

These cookies will last for several weeks.

6. Chocolate-covered raisins

What you’re really giving your rabbit with this treat is healthy fat, which is perfect for fending off those extra pounds.

What to do:

Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

Put 3 cups of unsweetened bakers chocolate in a saucepan over low heat, or in a glass bowl that fits on top of a saucepan.

Once it’s melted, stir in 1/4 cup of honey, 2 teaspoons of orange zest and vanilla extract. Stir well.

Pour the mixture into a bowl and put into the fridge to chill for about 10 minutes.

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and put the tray inside so it won’t move around when you mix in the raisins.

Melt the remaining chocolate.

Add 4 tablespoons of orange juice to the honey mixture. Mix well.

Once the chocolate is melted, add the liquid and mix until smooth.

Add the chocolate to the bowl and stir with a fork.

Pour this mixture into the cookie sheet. If there’s a spot in the dough that is higher than the rest, you can use a pastry brush to remove it.

Sprinkle with flax seeds or chopped nuts.

Once your rabbits have eaten some of these tasty treats, you’ll never want to put them back in their cage. Not only are they delicious, but they’ll also help give your rabbit an incredible nutritional boost!

7. Broccoli and raisins

Broccoli is high in antioxidants and vitamin C, which helps improve their health.

Broccoli, and other healthy vegetables, can also be found on the shelves of your local grocery store. In order to avoid pesticide residues, you should buy organic produce.

What to do:

Put 1 broccoli in a pot of boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes or until it’s fork tender. Take it out of the pot and drain. Put it in a mixing bowl and add 1 teaspoon of butter.

Stir the butter into the hot broccoli.

Add 1 tablespoon of raisins and 1 tablespoon of nuts. Mix well.

Add the rest of the ingredients (if using). Mix well.

Serve your rabbit at room temperature.

8. Strawberry smoothie

Strawberries are high in nutrients and contain anti-aging properties that are perfect for your rabbits. Strawberries are often found in many other products as well, and you can add them to your rabbit’s meal without adding any extra calories.

Strawberries are loaded with Vitamins A and C, which is great for maintaining their health and immunity. It also helps relieve their stomachs of gas, diarrhea and constipation. Adding strawberries to your rabbit’s diet is one of the best things you can do for them.

Here’s how to make them:

Put the honey, coconut oil, flour, and cinnamon into a blender.

Add the eggs and milk. Mix thoroughly.

Put the strawberries into a blender with the honey, coconut oil, oil, and cinnamon. Add to the mixture.

Pour the mixture into a mixing bowl.

Serve at room temperature.

You can substitute the honey with maple syrup, or replace the coconut oil with another fat like coconut oil or macadamia nut oil.

Keep in mind that fruits are a great source of vitamins and minerals. However, the sugar can be problematic for rabbits, which is why you should always check with a veterinarian before you give them fruit.

10. Mixed fruit

This is another great way to get fiber into your rabbit’s diet. This will help improve their overall health, but you’ll also need to limit the amount of grapes. One grape is 1/8 of a teaspoon of sugar, so it’s best to avoid giving too much at once.

What to do:

Cut up the strawberries and bananas and remove their seeds.

Mix together the honey, brown sugar, vanilla extract, butter, salt, coconut oil, and flour until well combined.
