Well, that's all I need to hear to make me feel okay about the whole 
thing......  She's a nice person and doesn't deserve that.

So, in summary - she's taking her "baby" to New York, without us, as a 
birthday present.  I don't have a problem with her taking HIM there, but 
I'm just trying to give her the benefit of the doubt on the "relationship" 
front.  She's got to understand it isn't easy for someone to have her 
dilemmas. 

Thoughts?

I just bought tickets to see Sting at the Izod center on Jan. 18.  I have
2 tix for myself and I would like to know if you and Michael are interested
in coming with me.  Also, I have two tix to the Hootie and the Blowfish
concert at the Izod Center on March 13.  Again, me and you for either
show.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:18
