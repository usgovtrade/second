Warren Buffett

Earnings are coming up and I am a stockholder in my company for over 12 years, its time for me to get my money in the market before I sell a few thousand shares, as the best I am looking at doing is selling a few hundred shares now and waiting for it to rise. I know that the stock is pretty low but its what I have. I also know that I have enough that if it goes much lower than a buck I will just dump it and do nothing. I sold a few thousand shares of my oil company to invest in stocks that were also low so I can see what I have made in that if the best returns, what do I do if not, sell and cash out and wait for something different, I just want to see some decent returns so I can quit working for a while. I really do not have an idea as to what to do, if I go for my money I will miss out on profits.

Trying to make money is a very difficult task for me as I have very little training, as to what I can do. I know that there are a lot of people that make money out of nothing, but I do not have a lot of time to put it all together, nor do I have a lot of capital to go after that. Even though I do not have that, I do know that I need to do something with it to have it work for me. I also know that if I could get rich quick it would not last long, that what I need to do is make sure I know how to make more money. I can not make any money if I do not have the knowledge on how to make the money, so I guess that what I need to do is find out how to make the money and start doing it.

I am a person who does not give up easily on something I have dedicated so much of my life to, so I am going to look at what I do and do that. It took me more than 6 months to come up with the idea of this and I am not going to stop now, I am going to keep looking for stocks to invest in and see what happens, for now I am just going to look at oil stocks as I have seen people make good profits from there, but I also know that I need to do a lot of studying before I put myself out there. So I am going to leave it all to the professionals, there are a lot of these sites that will keep giving you advice on how to invest so I will just find a site that will give me advice. I hope this works, as there is a good chance that it will.

I am taking a chance on what I do not know. If I get this money it should at least give me a shot at something I know and that is that I can make some decent money out of stocks. I do not know how long it will take to make it back but I do know that it will and that is my goal. I can see that I need to go to another website that has to do with investing as that is what I need right now, how to make money.

So I need to find out how to make money and then just do it, I do not know how long it will take me to do it but I know that I will do it. This is a way that I can start with not much to get some good profits on stocks, I think that is the only way I can make money right now, starting with little and getting bigger. I have never had much money but I have always made my own way and that is a pretty good thing, even though I may not have been rich and I may not have made as much money as I am going to make now, I have always had a good way of making it. I like looking for investments in stocks that pay me good money.

Looking for ways to make money is a pretty simple thing, just look for one or two ways and be sure that I can do it on my own and make a decent profit. I do know that there are a lot of companies that are just looking for ways to make money and in doing that they will make a whole lot more money than they are making. As long as they are making money it will not bother me too much, as I do know that they are doing that because they can do that. They are doing that because they have their capital and know that they can make it for themselves. In the old days people had to make their own way, there was a time when if a man wanted money he had to work for it. Now though there are a lot of people that have made the big bucks and there are those that have not. I think that most people do not think that the rich do not share what they have and that they do not have to share with the rest of us, well that is wrong, they do not think of that.

I am going to start to look for ways to make money that I can do on my own and make a lot of money off of it and start a business of my own. I do know that I need to start getting into some real good stocks that I can easily sell and make my money back. I think that if I can just get into some good stocks that I can sell and make a lot of money off of that I will do just fine. I need to find that and when I get into it I will be able to do things better and see what is going on around me. I will know how to make money from stocks, how to start a company, how to make an investment and make good money.

It does not take much to make a profit, as long as you can make it the money you will just keep it and make more money out of it. As long as I get the right stocks then I am sure that I can make it, I do not know how long it will take me but I do know that I can do it. When I do that, I am going to know a little more about stocks than I do now, so I will know more than I do now. Then I can look at some stocks that are good that I can make a little money from and also work for a job and make the rest of the money I need to make a little more. I have a lot of things that I do that I can make money off of and work for a while and save enough to invest some more, then I can sell the stocks that I want.

Looking for ways to make money is a pretty simple thing, just find one or two ways and be sure that I can do it on my own and make a decent profit. I do know that there are a lot of companies that are just looking for ways to make money and in doing that they will make a whole lot more money than they are making.
