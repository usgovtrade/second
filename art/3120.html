It is unclear whether the curse was ever intended to reverse itself, or if it will revert over time. Or perhaps, it is never to be undone.

The Khoisan

The curse and its effects have had great effects on the Khoisan and their culture. The effects on the culture of the Khoisan included the extinction of indigenous populations, disease, the arrival of Europeans and the adoption of foreign cultures and customs. The decline of the indigenous population had an impact on their culture; a decline in the indigenous population resulted in a culture more dependent on European colonists for goods and medicines as their agriculture systems declined.

The Khoisan also believed that the reason they have lost so much territory was that their ancestors had "breathed their last".

In addition to the deaths of many of the Khoisan, many African people throughout the early 20th century thought the Khoisan had left the world by means of a great flood.
