8Information

Wrangell Visitor CenterTOURIST INFORMATION

( %907-874-3853;  h8am-5pm)

Located right in the heart of town and operated by Alaska State Parks, this is the best place to ask for information about getting to Prince of Wales and the surrounding national park and forest.

### Ketchikan

POP 8704

Ketchikan is Alaska's premier cruise-ship destination. The city's setting is so beautiful that it's no surprise. Surrounded by forested mountains and sparkling Tongass Narrows, Ketchikan is on a narrow, north-facing fjord and sheltered from the Pacific Ocean by the protected waters of Revillagigedo Island. Just offshore is magnificent, undeveloped Deer Mountain.

Ketchikan has developed a bit of a reputation for the number of its drunk fishermen that end up in local hospitals after misjudging the power of the Tongass Narrows on a charter trip.

In a town with eight bars in the first block, you won't find a lot of late-night action. But with all this talk about booze, don't think for a minute Ketchikan doesn't have the nightlife. The visitor center has a copy of the _Ketchikan Visitor's Guide,_ a monthly calendar of events, and a comprehensive list of bars, cafes and shops.

The Alaska Marine Highway runs a passenger-only ferry service to Prince Rupert, BC, a popular side trip for cruise ships, and south to the BC ferry terminal at Hyder.

The creek is accessible from Ketchikan Creek Rd, about 5 miles north of downtown.

### FRESHWATER BAY AREA

The breathtaking North Tongass National Forest and protected waters of Tongass Narrows have been called one of the world's most beautiful corners. The area's four main national forest districts (North Fork, Klukwan, Tongass Narrows and Misty Fiords) together include 15.5 million acres of land (29% of all US Forest Service lands in Alaska).

A dozen or so rivers join to create the region's rich inland waterways. The **Tongass Narrows** (the narrowest natural channel in the world, with a channel width of 1200ft) meets the Pacific Ocean just south of Ketchikan and spreads to the south. The **Chatham Strait** is dominated by a series of islands known as the Prince of Wales Strait **Marine Reserve** ; it's home to bald eagles, black bears, whales, sea otters and killer whales. Nearby Chichagof Island is famous for its bald eagles. To the north, **Turnagain Arm** is the main fishing access, while nearby Chilkat and Chilkoot Inlets are known for superb fishing for salmon.

For information about these areas, visit the South Tongass National Conservation Area Headquarters (www.fws.gov/south-tongass-national-conservation-area).

For a great overview, go to the Ketchikan Ranger District Office ( %907-225-7540; www.fs.fed.us/r10; 100 Main St) and pick up a free Tongass Narrows Guide to the Tongass Narrows National Marine Sanctuary Map. There's also a downloadable map at www.seattlenorth.com.
