This way you just need your hands and a blender, and you can create fresh green smoothies in minutes.

You can use only a few vegetables or veggies. I always use carrot, apple, and celery as most of the people like these three vegetables as well as healthy.

Ingredients:

1 cup of vegetable (Carrot, apple, and celery)

1/4 cup of milk

1 tbsp flax seeds

Blend it all together in a blender until all the pieces are smooth. You can even add extra milk to get the perfect smoothie. You can add milk as much as you want to the smoothie as this will depends on your own choice. Try it, I am sure you are gonna love it.

I do not take ice in my smoothie. This is my personal choice. There is no need for ice as my smoothie is so thick and you donâ€™t even need an ice. You can add ice if you feel your smoothie is too thick to your taste, but there is no need for any.

You can add any vegetable, especially if it is in season or any other fruit as well, if you have that option at home.

This will not only provide your body with all essential nutrients and energy but you will also be doing the best for your children as they are growing fast.

You can also add berries in this. It will give you healthy vitamin to your child as berries are full of vitamin. In case you want some of the vitamins in your smoothie, you can also add spinach and kale to your smoothie. If you want your smoothie with extra smoothie, add a frozen banana.

Here is how you should prepare the best smoothie ever.

Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the mixture is smooth. If you are a beginner, make sure to put the frozen banana to the bottom to prevent breaking the blender.

Next thing is to put the smoothie in a freezer before serving. I use a container with a lid to store the smoothie as I do not want it to become freezer burn. You can also store your frozen smoothie in the fridge, but remember to keep the smoothie in freezer when it is still in smoothie. It will be much better for your smoothie.

This is how you should make the best Smoothie:

This is the easiest and fastest way to make healthy smoothies at home and keep you healthy. It is also easy to freeze your smoothie and you can easily prepare your fresh smoothie at home, or anywhere. I enjoy having a glass of smoothie every morning.
