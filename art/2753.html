“That’s why we felt it was really important to get them out, even though we don’t have the resources, we’re doing all we can to protect the public health and the environment,” said Steve Pawinski, one of the community organizers behind the cleanup.

After the trees were pulled from the landfill, the organizers transported them across San Diego County to a staging area at La Gran Plaza Park. They’re currently arranging a pickup and distribution of the trees.

It’s all a labor of love for these men and women, Pawinski said. They work on the cleanup without pay, often sacrificing time with their families for this work.


“We don’t get paid, but we all believe in this and it’s what we want to do,” he said. “It’s a labor of love.”
