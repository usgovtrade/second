In the 1970s, Michael Mann directed a series of cult slasher films. He later became a crime thriller director, known for Manhunter (1986), Heat (1995), and the television crime dramas Criminal Minds (2005) and Narcos (2015).

The original Nightmare on Elm Street had no “Wipe Out” moments.

In an extra scene that was deleted from the film, Freddy had a baseball bat of revenge and threw the ball of energy into the crowd.

The original film went on to spawn sequels: The Dream Child (1989), Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991), Freddy’s Dead: The Final DLC (2017).

The original sequel, Dream Warriors, had no monsters.

Freddy’s Revenge’s box office broke multiple records: first R-rated horror movie to gross $100 million; highest grossing horror film; and highest grossing film in one day.

The original Freddy vs. Jason film was directed by “The Blair Witch Project’s” Daniel Myrick.

A lot of the Freddy sequels were shot on location in the town of Warners, Indiana, which is the setting of Stephen King’s “The Mist.” It has been used as a movie location since 1985.

In real life, the entire body of Freddy Krueger is on display in Warners.

The creators of Freddy vs. Jason were inspired to make the film after watching Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael Myers. The filmmakers had originally wanted to do the crossover film but then decided to make Freddy vs. Jason instead, because they thought it would be much easier to make the crossover film with Freddy vs. Jason.

After Freddy and Jason’s fights in Freddy vs. Jason, you can find them fighting again on the playground in Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash.

Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash’s opening sequence is a recreation of the movie The Goonies, in which Freddy, Jason, and Ash play “One-Eyed Willie” on the jungle gym. In Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, you can find the three fighting in the background in one scene in the film.

The original NES game was released in 1984 and is available for purchase on eBay for $30,000 (although you can get a copy of the game for free by using the cheat codes “NESLUCASVG” and “BETREDDYGAMBIT).

The first game featured a cameo appearance by Jack Nicholson.

The original NES game has one of the few movie tie-ins ever produced for the game console.

The three original NES games each had several sequels: Nightmare in Space (1987) and a pair of sequels titled Dread (1990) and Freddy’s Nightmares (1992).

Dread’s game box claimed that the film it was based on was a “Stephen King’s ‘Poltergeist’ rip-off film.”

Stephen King once wrote a story for the NES, which was never completed.

Nightmares in Silver is the least-successful of the Nightmare on Elm Street games.

Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash was only released in Japan as an OVA (original video anime). It was then given a full-length theatrical release.

Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, which was directed by “Pulp Fiction’s” Quentin Tarantino, was also dubbed by Tarantino.

Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash was the first Dream Warriors movie to have been released on DVD.

The opening credits of Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash feature an obscure band called The New Order.

Freddy and Jason’s fighting style differs from one another in the films. For example, in Freddy vs. Jason, Freddy is armed with two swords while Jason fights with the power of the Necronomicon, a book, which was a source of great power for him in Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash.

One of Freddy’s swords from Freddy vs. Jason has become the Internet symbol for a meme involving a video game called The Legend of Zelda.

The director of Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash stated that he wanted the film to be a combination of “The Goonies” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”

Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash marks the first time Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees were pitted against each other, in a film that also starred Ash Williams.

Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash marks the first time Freddy and Jason are depicted fighting together. Before Freddy vs. Jason, they were depicted as two separately in their horror film “Halloween” and action film “A Nightmare on Elm Street.”

Ash’s weapon is called the “Slingshot” by the toys but the film it is named after is called “Sword & Sorcery.” In the toys, Ash does not use the “Slingshot” while fighting Freddy and Jason but the film it is named after does use the “Slingshot.”

In the Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash trailer, the film’s title is stylized on the front and back as “THE A.D.” This is a nod to Ash’s new title in the film: A.D., which stands for “artistic director.”

Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash is known as one of the films that inspired the creation of a video game called Silent Hill.

Since the original Nightmare on Elm Street, Freddy Krueger’s first name was not explained in the films until Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash.

Freddy’s “Nightmare Killer” name was inspired by Freddy vs. Jason’s ending, in which Freddy’s claw hand is taken off by a chainsaw, thereby making him weak. He can only use his head to attack now, just like Michael Myers’ character “The Shape.”

It has been speculated that the original Nightmare on Elm Street was originally supposed to be called “Freddy in the Dark” in which Freddy would have fought with a young man, after he escaped from his mother’s dreamworld. The film was to be called “Freddy on Elm Street.”

In the opening sequence of Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, there is a brief, very scary shot of Freddy’s eyes. The image resembles a dead eye that you see when you hit your own thumb with a hammer.

Dream Warriors was supposed to feature the Freddy and Jason’s dream world, but the scene was dropped during production. Instead, there were only two Dream Warriors films.

The director of Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, Renny Harlin, said that his intention was to create a Freddy Krueger who you wouldn’t know is Freddy Krueger because the film was the first of many to be released in the film franchise, and to make a movie that you could watch with your children.

In the movie Halloween III: Season of the Witch, the final film in the Halloween series, Freddy Krueger appears as a hallucination. It’s revealed that Freddy wasn’t killed in the movie but was instead left behind by Michael Myers, as he’s unable to enter Freddy’s dimension.

Freddy Krueger’s first film was released in the U.S. in 1984. In Japan, the film was released as “The Dream Child.”

The U.S. version of Freddy Krueger’s fifth appearance, Freddy’s Dead, originally featured three different endings in which Freddy and Jason would have killed one another. One of those endings would have resulted in Freddy being killed by a shotgun blast, leading to a different, even more twisted sequel. That ending was cut out of the movie.

The U.S. version of Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare was originally supposed to be called Freddy’s Dead.

After Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare, many of the Freddy vs. Jason sequels made with a different director were titled Freddy’s Dead Parts V, VI, etc.

The original Freddy vs. Jason film featured a guest appearance by the rock band Whitesnake.

The video game Resident Evil was inspired by Freddy vs. Jason.

Tim Curry was set to appear in the original Freddy vs. Jason, but the movie was canceled before production started. Instead, Curry had a cameo in Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash as the voice of the “Evil Incarnate.”

The original Freddy vs. Jason film had been planned to release in 2008 but went straight to DVD.
