The use of civil forfeiture is the practice of seizing property from those who are presumed innocent and have not been convicted of a crime. In exchange for forfeiture, the owner is presumed innocent. Civil forfeiture has been used most commonly to prosecute drug traffickers, but it has also been employed against owners and users of firearms, boats and automobiles, for example. Civil forfeiture requires only an allegation of guilt. Conviction is not required and innocent owners are not granted due process.

Enrollment is a more traditional, common-law process. When a felony suspect is taken into custody, law enforcement must have probable cause that the individual was committing or has committed a felony to obtain a search warrant or arrest warrant from a judge. At the time of writing, an owner in most states has protection from seizure of property when there is no conviction.
