In the context of this application, drive means is understood to refer to all means which are suitable for supplying a rotatory driving energy for the actuation of the work-performing machine part. The drive means may comprise a source of a shaft or rotating motion which is coupled with the work-performing machine part in a manner permitting an effective transfer of the rotatory driving energy to the work-performing machine part. The drive means is further arranged to generate a rotatory driving force which is adjustable or controllable, as required.
In modern burner control systems, the position of the burner nozzle or gas discharge burner head, which determines the combustion zone, is required to be controlled. In the combustion zone, the combustion takes place with a minimum volume or to a minimum value. In this connection, special arrangements of the combustion process are used. A burner which has a swirling inflow air arrangement is described in the magazine "Combustion-Engine International", pages 22 to 26. It is thereby recognized that the swirling inflow air arrangement has the effect that the incoming air is first accelerated and the ignition region is formed in the area of an ignition location of the combustion process.
It is known to control the temperature of the burner flame by regulating a main burner flow and/or a pilot burner flow. The burner nozzles are equipped with sensors for measuring temperature or heat, these sensors being formed as thermoelements. These sensors are arranged in the interior of the burner nozzle and in the burner flame. The main burner flow and/or pilot burner flow is controlled on the basis of these measured values. The disadvantage of this method is that the sensors for measuring temperature or heat are provided in the interior of the burner nozzle, and it has been determined that these sensors are exposed to thermal losses and are disturbed by other burner heating mechanisms. In this case, a measuring operation takes place by a so-called sensor which must be arranged at a specific location in the area of the burner flame. Furthermore, it is possible that the sensor which has been determined does not indicate the state of the flame, but indicates only the flame temperature. As a result, the control of the burner temperature is subject to a significant measuring inaccuracy.
The assignee's copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/024,811, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,337,718, dated Aug. 16, 1994, discloses a burner arrangement wherein an ignition zone is controlled by means of a flame burner sensor or a flame sensor. This burner arrangement has a pilot burner and a main burner arranged downstream of the pilot burner, the flame burner sensor generating a first signal and the main burner being arranged upstream of the flame burner sensor so that the main burner supplies its energy to the combustion chamber. The flow of the burner stream is controllable by means of the pilot burner. The main burner is controllable by means of an electrical control signal of the flame burner sensor.
This burner arrangement has the disadvantage that a burner which has a swirling inflow air arrangement is not provided, so that the burner has only a substancial heating effect. This makes it possible to have a temperature control of the burner. The burner arrangement also has the disadvantage that it is not a flame burner control which, particularly, is controllable with high-frequency signals, but rather is a sensor control in which a main burner temperature control is dependent on the temperature of the flame and the temperature of the gas discharged by the main burner. The disadvantage of the burner arrangement, which utilizes an electric flame burner sensor for control purposes, is that the output voltage of a Hall effect sensor used for this purpose is subject to a temperature dependency.
It is further known to control a burner by the use of a swirling inflow air arrangement wherein swirling intake air flows through the burner nozzle into an ignition location of a burner flame in the combustion zone and thus affects the combustion process and generates a heating effect. This swirling intake air arrangement provides the advantage that it represents a measure of a type which is independent from the geometry of the burner nozzle or gas discharge burner head. It is also possible that other parameters such as the temperature of the burner flame, have no adverse influence on this type of control. This type of control is, however, not suitable for the above described burner arrangement which has a swirling inflow air arrangement. The reason for this is that a swirling inflow air arrangement in which the inflow air is directed in a direction in the plane of a nozzle axis. There is also provided a control for controlling the swirling intake air arrangement, which control comprises a fuel supply by means of which the swirling intake air can be preheated. For that reason, the swirling intake air arrangement is not a sensor control wherein the position of the burner nozzle or gas discharge burner head is adjusted in accordance with the signals of a sensor device. The swirling intake air arrangement constitutes a separate, independent control.
The invention therefore is based on the task to provide a burner arrangement which has the advantages described above and can be controlled with high reliability.
According to the invention, the above-described task is accomplished by means of a burner arrangement, particularly a burner arrangement for a furnace installation, which comprises a burner element having a swirling inflow air arrangement and a burner arrangement having a control arrangement. A burner arrangement having a control arrangement includes a sensor arrangement for controlling the swirling inflow air arrangement, and an evaluation circuit which is connected with the sensor arrangement, the evaluation circuit</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:29:25
