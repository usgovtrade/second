You can use just about any dried fruit in this recipe, depending on the season. However, if you plan to eat this for breakfast or as a snack, I would recommend you cut back on the dried fruit a little. The fruit will still add some sweetness to your yogurt, but will probably be a little more healthful for you, especially if you are following a ‚Äúdetox‚Äù diet.

Great recipe! I love yogurt and will start making yogurt in a jar just like this. I would use 1/2 cup milk plus 1/2 cup plain yogurt at this point. Thanks so much for the tip! It seems like it took forever for yogurt to catch on in our family. It just wasn‚Äôt as good as storebought and I had a hard time trying to sell it. Thanks so much for the great recipe. It‚Äôs easy and yummy!

I agree ‚Äî the hardest part about making yogurt is getting your kids to eat it! We give them plain yogurt most of the time, or yogurt with fresh fruit and berries. If they‚Äôre willing to eat the fruit and berries, they‚Äôll go for a healthy and tasty yogurt.

Thanks so much, and hope you enjoy your yogurt!

I have tried making yogurt without rennet many times. I use yogurt made from raw milk (I buy the milk directly from a local farmer) and let it ferment. I use the same method as your recipe, but I boil for 15 minutes, and then let it cool before putting it in the jars. Sometimes it separates. I don‚Äôt know why. My yogurt never gets thick enough to eat from the top of the jar. When I do that, it tastes better. Then I have to add a thickener, like corn starch.

So, I haven‚Äôt had any success making yogurt yet, but I will keep trying! And I would love to buy your book. So, what are some of the things you would suggest as thickeners? Is powdered milk my best bet, or could I add corn starch or fruit puree?

Hi Peg, I‚Äôve never tried using raw milk, so I don‚Äôt know if it will work or not, but the texture might be different, as with boiled yogurt. If you boil the milk first (as with these yogurt starters), it should help to get the yogurt to thicken. But it might also thin the yogurt a bit more. I find the best thing to use is 1/2 cup of powdered milk and 1/2 cup of plain yogurt. So, you could try this experiment. You should have a few jars ready by then to test out the results.

And don‚Äôt forget, you could make yogurt from a fresh cow or goat milk too, if that‚Äôs an option for you. It‚Äôs just more work, since you have to watch the culture and the temperature more carefully, and it takes longer to thicken. But if you make it often, it may be worth the effort. You could experiment with both methods ‚Äî buy a gallon of milk or get your goat, and get going on your own homemade yogurt.

Hey! Just wanted to let you know that I just used your basic starter culture, milk, and yogurt recipe with success. I thought I would be a nervous wreck making yogurt but it really wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Like you, I had been using the expensive culture. I loved it, but it was costing me so much more than a quart of raw milk, I thought I would give your yogurt a try. As you stated, so much easier and cheaper than buying prepared yogurt. As for thickening the yogurt, I just added a teaspoon of brown sugar and a tablespoon of yogurt.

I found your book via a link from the local raw milk dairy in Ohio. They are an awesome dairy and make some terrific raw milk products. Their blog, the blog, has really helped me to understand many things about local milk and dairy.

I have read most of your blog and find it very helpful. I just found your book in my local library system. I have looked at your website many times and see lots of recipes. Thank you for sharing your wisdom with all of us. I recently started a grass-based dairy goat dairy with my family. We live on a small farm and raise beef, sheep, goats, and hay and pasture it on our farm. We will soon be keeping a few sheep as we are getting over the hurdle of buying them for the first time. We are now getting our heifers ready for our herd of goats and I would love to find a recipe for some really good goat milk soap. I know goats milk soap is more labor intensive than cow milk but if I can find a really good recipe it will be worth all the work. I love my yogurt and would like to make it at home from my goats milk and my own goats milk soaps. I would also love to be able to make a lot of cheese as well. I was also wondering if you have any advice on making milk kefir? Again thanks so much for all the recipes and for helping me through the learning curve of trying to find a goat in my town. I find your blog is very helpful as I am new to</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:44
