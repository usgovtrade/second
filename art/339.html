I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things greatly. I told you 
two years ago it was not a good idea to try to get them to do what they 
couldn't do. 
I am looking out for them, trying to give them a break. I don't want you 
to. That is the last time you go down to OOC and discuss something like 
that. 
I tried to talk them into this deal, the BPA, but they refused. It was not 
my call. Do not worry about it. 
Chris, you have got a lot of things going on. Let the BPA go.
