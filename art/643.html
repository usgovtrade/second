What is wrong with it?" She says she is just being a friend. What the 
hell!?!?  The fact that she will  give me this line makes me think that she 
has probably slept with him. In any case, the point is, why did she sleep 
with him if she did not love him?  The only reason is because she loved him 
so much that it trumped her common sense. It is OK for me to be jealous because 
I slept with my best friend, so why can't she sleep with her fiance?  If she 
wanted to, why didn't she sleep with him before? I am so hurt. I can't believe 
I spent over $3,000 of my money on this.  I think I should go buy myself a gun, 
just in case he hurts me, he is so abusive. 
I am so hurt. If she slept with him without feeling any love, she never loved 
me. I mean, he may be an OK guy and all, and if I was not in a relationship, I 
may even be thinking of making out with him, but can anyone love me like I 
love him? I always knew my former boyfriend was a selfish, womanizing 
S.O.B., but I never thought it was this bad. 
I will never forget the day I moved out of my apartment. I said good-bye to my 
best friend, who I loved like a sister. Now I hate her. I hate myself for 
thinking this way about her, but there is nothing I can do about it. I 
should just let her go. She deserves to be happy, unlike me, who spent so much 
money on clothes and on her, and now will never have her own children. I don't 
know what to do. I'm sorry.

Personal Columns 
In this section, writers tell what's on their minds--young or old, single or 
coupled, gay or straight. What makes today's columnists tick? Perhaps they can 
help you find answers to the questions you've always wanted to ask. Or perhaps 
they'll just give you a better understanding of yourself. Either way, it's 
sure to make for lively reading. 
The Gay Dude An Excerpt from "A Date with a Gay Guy: And Other Things Gay Dudes 
Like" 
He should be gay. All his good qualities should have drawn him to the 
homosexual lifestyle. The fact that he isn't will forever be a mystery. 
It might be too late to change. His mother has already told him that he is a 
"disappointment." 
Why aren't I gay? I go to clubs a lot. I have a great time at hot DJ parties 
that feature some hard, young dance music. I look around for men who make eye 
contact with me. I want to exchange a smile with someone. You might find it 
unmanly, but when I make eye contact with a dude I'm into, I smile. Not a 
smile full of teeth, but a real genuine one, for sure. 
I might even be a little more excited than I would be if a non-gay dude were 
giving me his full attention. I'm proud of myself when a gay guy gives me his 
full attention. I'm not sure I've ever had a straight guy who liked me give me 
his full attention. I'm sure it's happened before. And when it does happen, I 
notice. 
I can't even tell you why I do this. It just feels right. It's like I'm trying 
to get in touch with my roots. Deep inside, I can't help but think that all 
men, all human beings, need love. But I don't think that's a lesbian thing, 
and I don't think it's a gay thing, either. It's just my way of being human. 
The Straight Dude An excerpt from "How to Please a Lesbian" by a Straight 
Dude 
Recently I was watching a nature program on National Geographic when a lone 
cheetah raced across the veldt. It had pounced on a baby gazelle and it was 
going in for the kill. The gazelle was in hysterics. 
I hate hunting, and I wish I could have felt more sympathy for it. But the 
fact is that the gazelle was about to become dinner, so I couldn't empathize 
with it. 
If I could have moved to Florida and befriended the cheetah, I might have 
wondered whether it had any reservations about the hunt. Would it have felt 
guilty about the gazelle's terror? 
Perhaps I would have asked it to look at me in the eye and acknowledge that 
the gazelle was going through hell, and it was going to be killed, either way. 
But no such luck, I was stuck in front of the TV watching the chase. 
A few weeks later, my brother, Mark, came over to visit me, and we were talking 
in the backyard. He started talking about his girlfriend and how he can't wait 
to take her on a "real date." 
I was interested. I'd never really gotten around to taking a woman on a date. 
So we talked about dates, and how Mark was going to take his girlfriend, Stacey, 
out for a nice dinner and some wine, a walk in a nearby park, maybe a movie. 
When Mark was a teenager, he was involved with the girl next door. They were 
going to be married, but the problem was that he'd lost his virginity to her. 
The last thing he wanted was for that to happen again. 
I nodded as I listened to Mark talk. I always liked his girlfriend, Stacey. 
After a few years, Mark and Stacey got married and had a baby, so now I felt 
even closer to Mark because his whole family was there. 
I also liked the fact that Mark was concerned about Stacey's past--and his own. 
He knew about condoms and how to use them. I don't think he ever did use one 
with Stacey, but when he did, he would make sure she didn't just push it on to 
the head. 
I'm a real straight-laced guy. I work hard for my money, and I try to take 
care of my friends. Mark said he was worried that one day Stacey's ex-boyfriend 
would show up out of nowhere. And that would be a real danger to her, of 
course, because Mark's gay. I nodded again, and I knew what he meant. 
When I got married to Rachel, I promised my parents that I would never do 
anything to hurt her or them. I remember thinking how hard it was to make 
those vows to my mother and father because I never expected to end up with a 
girl. 
Before I knew it, I was married to Rachel and living a straight life. She 
understands my straight side, but she also understands that I am not a lesbian 
or bisexual. I'd never been attracted to a man. Until Rachel, I never thought 
of myself as bi. And she's beautiful. She has always been gorgeous. And she's 
straight. 
How can I explain to you how I felt when I left the man who was with us that 
night to go home to my straight wife? I felt like I was going to a different 
world, a different universe. But I was happy to go, because it meant that I 
was making the choices I'd always wanted to make. I was living in my truth. I 
was making my dreams come true. 
I'm back from the date with Mark and Stacey. The two of us took a long walk, 
and we told each other a lot of things we had never told anyone. At the park 
near the parking lot of our apartment building, Mark asked me if I wanted to 
go see a movie with him. I shook my head no. I'm not sure I want to see a 
movie with another man</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:51
