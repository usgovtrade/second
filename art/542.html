“The power is unquenchable. It flows from the core of the earth itself”.

In the spring of 2009 a documentary film crew arrived in Baku to follow up with the film crew that had already been there that year. 
The group shot footage of the documentary being produced as well as shots of the crew of the ship.
With the crew being finished in June 2009, they were offered a contract with Warner Bros. to make a movie based on the documentary.

While the documentary was edited, an offer came from BBC to film another documentary with their crew, which was done over a three-week period.
Filming was completed in September 2009.

On January 1, 2010, the film, titled Earth: One Amazing Day was premiered in the United States.

Critical reviews and reception

Earth: One Amazing Day was well received by critics and currently has a 90% “Fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.8/10.

Cynthia Fuchs of Variety, states "It’s a little too obvious to call Earth: One Amazing Day the latest incarnation of “Dangerous Adventures With the Experts,” but it works just as well as a movie about nature and the environment as it does for people in general — even, perhaps, those who can’t get enough of the Discovery Channel."

Maggie Lee of The Village Voice, states "Director James Jones, who made the excellent 2005 documentary Earth Days, and producer David Lickley, whose previous doc, Dengue Fever, is a gripping investigation of dengue fever, turn up the ante with a story that goes far beyond the usual science-gunk fare."
