Nancy,

I haven't heard about the big T since I moved to Austin about 12 years
ago.  It sounds like Enron's growth from a risk perspective doesn't quite
match its hot growth from an earnings perspective.  Man, I love working
for a
grower!

Jeez, do you think you'll ever get married again?  How does your daughter
like Austin?

I was sorry to hear about Sternwood.

Best to you and your family,
Ken

   I was so happy to get your email until I realized it was about
   Tiffany.  Not very funny, but I am very happy for you and will have
   your back forever.  You are totally right about her, and I was sort of
   getting that feeling so thank you.  I do miss your sense of humor, so
   let's
   get together soon for some more of that!  Love you.  Nancy

   Quick humor - work related.  This came from behind the newsroom door
   over lunch (best I can describe it)


   An elderly lady asked her doctor, "Why is it that I have
   arthritis?"  He
   replied, "Because your arteries are clogged with cholesterol."  She
   sits in
   the doctor's office and says, "What's the answer?"   "See that
   condom?  Buy it.  Put it on.   Kiss your arthritis goodbye."
