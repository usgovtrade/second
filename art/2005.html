"I've come back to bring order to the chaos." "The world of the puppet!" " I'll destroy you!" "Destroy!" "Destroy!" "You bastard!" "I'll get you for this." "Go and change out of your sweater, while it's still clean." "You need a bath." "Lars, I'll show him!" "Do not touch my son." "And you be quiet, or I'll rip your tongue out!" "The door was open." "The door was open, so I came in." "You saw me." "Sure, I saw you." "I have a little gift for you." "That's from my mother." "It's for you!" "My Tic-Tac!" "Thanks." "Here, you look good in this outfit." " I'm going to the bathhouse." " Are you hungry?" "You can keep that, it's from the people at the factory." " I didn't say you had to..." " Yes, I want to stay with you." " What is it?" " A lion!" "A lion!" " It's probably just garbage." "Then why are you crying?" "I don't know." "I don't know." "Dad always knows what to do." "Yes, when he is at home." "But when he leaves, we get orphans." "There's a way to stop the orphans." "The lion's head is still attached." "There's no way we'll get the body back in the can." "You can sew it up if you like." "What should we do with him?" "The lion can't be in the bathhouse." "Lars, we have to come up with something for the lion." " I'll get some water." " It's about time." "I was thinking of giving him something to eat." " You've torn your sweater again." " I haven't torn it." "It's a lion." "You have to admit he's beautiful." "Let me try and talk to him." "Hi, lion." "I'm Nisse's mother." "Do you know Nisse?" "I've been a friend of his dad's for many years." "I'd have been nice to you, but I'm afraid I don't have any food." "Is he really dead?" "He's sleeping." "That's why he doesn't have much appetite." "I want to go on a boat trip with Nisse." "But first I need some money for the tickets." "I know where Nisse's dad keeps his money." "There's ten thousand kroner here." "But it was a lot more before." "Where did it come from?" "I found it on the floor." "Maybe it was from before the war." "Nisse is very happy when someone leaves me money." "He's probably stolen it." "No, he didn't steal it." "We just talked about it." "We talked about it!" "Nisse must have told me." "There's a boat every Thursday." "We can take a trip." "He's been asking for that!" "He can't wait." "But this money is for the tickets, Nisse!" "Well, then it won't get used for something else." "But what if they catch us?" "That won't happen." "But there are police on the pier." "They're there to catch people who drink too much and try to run off on the boat!" " They don't care about kids." " Nisse!" "How did you think this was going to work out?" "I'm going to keep it." "If Nisse wakes up, we'll say goodbye to him." "I'd like to ask him one thing." "What is it?" "What is it?" "Is it something you wouldn't tell a girl?" "Do you think he'll wake up?" "He can't." "His whole chest is black with pneumonia." "Just the way my Tic-Tac used to look." "Did you ever have a Tic-Tac?" "Did you ever have a Tic-Tac?" "I don't know what it's like to have a Tic-Tac." "Not everything can be bought." "This can't be sold." "What is it, anyway?" "It's mine, not yours." "It's the one from the sea, I found it on the shore." "What are you going to do with it?" "We'll see if there's something we can sell it for." "It's dead, and that's too bad." "Lisa!" "No!" "Lisa!" "Do you have any clothes for a girl?" "Lisa!" "They're probably dirty." "I didn't steal anything!" "Lisa, no!" "You can go into the dressing room." " I'm really sorry about this." " It's all right." "It's very important that we get out of here." "No one is ever supposed to be in here, so they don't look for me." "And you go in there, and you're never going to leave." "They found the lion, and Nisse got into a lot of trouble." "He was sentenced to the military." "Lars was sentenced to the military." "That's when he was deported." "Yes, you shouldn't have torn your sweater." "Will you go with me to the end of the pier?" "I have to go back to the house, and then I'll leave here." "I didn't sell him." "Maybe you can sell them yourself one day." "Nisse thinks that the lion was someone that Nisse knew who was killed in the war." "He was on his way to see him at the end of the pier." "If he can do something with the lion, he'll stay." "Where does the lion go when it's dead?" " He says that the lion..." " I know where the lion goes." "Can I come with you?" "That's what we had set out to do when we started talking about it." "We thought we'd make some money." "But that was just a lie!" "Let's go home." "Just a couple of kilometres." "Then you can go home, and I can go to the circus." "The lion is in the house, and Nisse is at the police station!" "I'll bring you two some food, and then we'll go out again." "We'll just say goodbye." "It's been a long time since we've been here, and I still want to buy that ring, and then we'll go." "Lars, I'm not sure I can remember the story." "I can't read it." "That won't matter." "The boy can read it." "It will be the same as before." "Just act as if you were reading it." "I remember." "It was a long time ago." "The woman is selling her house, and everything she owns, and they say:" ""Do you remember me?" She says, "No."" ""But I was a good person, and I'm so proud of you."" ""I would like to remember you, but I can't." "It's too sad."" "Goodbye." "Then they go back to where she came from." "It's an old song." "Are you hungry?" "We can buy a fish here." "And a coffee." "I don't know how to get him up on the truck." "Don't look at me." "We need a winch." "Will we have to dig him up?" "It was my brother who came here." "He made money." "He was a smart man." "He had his own shop." "And he lived in a large house." "He took care of me." "He was nice to me." "And then he made money, and he took his boat out and left me behind." "Then we had nothing." "I had to work as a maid for people who thought that I was a rich woman, who had left her money behind." "If I couldn't pay back my debts, they made fun of me." "They shouted at me and hit me." "You have to go away from here." "You have to leave the city." "You have to leave everything, and start a new life." "Or you'll die." "What is it, Lars?" "What's happened?" "We're fine, just leave us alone!" "It's over!" "Do you hear what I'm saying?" "I didn't say anything!" "We're going to help you." "Your little friend is going to help us." " We are?" " Yes." "We're going to help you." "How?" " How are we going to help you?" " Help." "We're going to call the police." "We're going to put you in jail for a really long time." "We're going to do that right now." "You can't!" "He's dead." "Dead?" "Yes, he's dead." "My little friend." "But he didn't mean it." "No, it was an accident." "But I'm supposed to tell the police." "It was all my fault." "No, it was an accident!" "It was an accident." "I didn't mean to kill him." "He really wanted me to help him." "What can we do now?" "I've got to go home and then take the ferry out and meet him on the beach."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:50
