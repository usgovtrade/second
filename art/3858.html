The simulator opens with the app. The app starts up in the simulator, shows the app icon, but the menu items and back button are gray. When I click on them, they show a "Loading" message and then show up. If I close the simulator by hand, I can repeat the same scenario in another simulator, but then it stops working again.
My setup:

Mac OSX v10.8.2
Xcode v5.0.2
MonoDevelop v2.8.6
iPhone SDK v4.3 (I don't think this is the reason, as I've tested the code without an iPhone connected)

What I've tried:
I thought maybe it was a problem with the MonoDevelop or MonoTouch add-on for Visual Studio, so I've tried reinstalling the Visual Studio IDE - the problem remains the same. 
The above steps also apply to installing Mono for Android, although this time I had MonoDevelop open with a previously working Android project.
I can reproduce this behaviour on two different physical iMacs.
EDIT
I have also discovered that the simulator won't let me install the app from the beginning if I have the Simulator already open - it simply reopens the app at the place I was at in the already opened simulator (the simulator has not been exited, or rather not properly).

A:

The solution I found here: http://monotouch.net/Guide/Working_with_devices/
This is to get rid of the old simulator. Simply delete the entire project folder in your user directory for XCode (~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/), which will remove all files related to the simulator. Restarting the simulator should restore a new and clean simulator.

A:

I faced the same problem today.  I found that I could start the simulator, wait for it to appear with the progress circle, and then quit the simulator, then Xcode would have a clean slate to start a new iPhone simulator with no previous apps.  Sometimes it was only partially helpful to this, so quitting and restarting Xcode, but I did manage to get it to load in the same way you describe by quitting and re-running the simulator by itself.
Unfortunately, I don't know why that solution worked for me, but when I tried it, that's what happened.

A:

In case you are still facing the issue (as in 2017/06/22), you may try what I did.

Go to the folder (Macintosh HD/Users/[user]/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator) and remove the old data (older than 2 or 3 weeks).
This will force XCode to create a new simulator.
(optional) Launch XCode, choose your project, hit Run.
Now, the simulator should work correctly.

The only problem that I faced was that "old" .simdata files were still lying around... they could have been from a previous version of XCode. I don't think that they are relevant, though.

This was done on macOS 10.11.4 with Xcode 7.3.1.

The issue might have been caused by upgrading my XCode version.

Edit:
As stated in the comments, the actual problem was that the App is iOS 8, and thus the iOS 9 simulator will be used for the first time. From XCode 9.1 onwards, the iOS 8 simulator will be taken if there is no iOS 9 one available.
This explains the initial "gray" state.

To remedy this, I needed to manually launch the simulator (i.e. don't use XCode's simulator list).

It appears that the simulator cache was corrupted in my case, so XCode could not update the simulator - which then crashed.

The app is written in MonoTouch.

(I had to use MonoDevelop)

This is all I had:

XCode 6.3.1
MonoDevelop 3.0.5
