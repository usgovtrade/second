After his first two matches, Anderson is ready to have a match with his buddy. As long as it's non-pay per view, of course. Anderson tells us that he is a huge fan of Japanese professional wrestling and that he has gotten a lot of tips on becoming a pro wrestler from former Japanese wrestler AJ Styles. If you see AJ soon, please give him a giant tip for me, because I am starving.

After an intense staredown with Sano, Anderson and Sano shake hands and pose for the camera. We see Anderson giving the finger to someone off camera before he leaves. Anderson then walks into the locker room and finds his friend, Colt Cabana, who is already getting himself ready to wrestle. Anderson asks if Cabana knows where the bar is, before he notices that Cabana is holding two cups and asks if he knows how to make shots. (Cabana and Anderson like to think of themselves as the "Randy and Mister Perfect" of Ring of Honor. But these guys are about as funny as an egg salad sandwich.)

Luckily, Cabana knows how to make shots, which means he is ready to take on the evil Barbie doll, Kazuchika Okada.

Okada is just awesome, but I am still glad we got to see some blood in our first match. Okada gives a clean slam to Cabana, then gets a nearfall on him with some help from the referee.

Cabana gets the hot tag, and then tags in Jack Evans, who is the current one-time ROH Champion. Evans pins Okada with a hurricanrana, which will almost definitely lead to him taking his rematch with Okada at War of the Worlds. It is cool that Sano was standing by, but he doesn't get a chance to interfere.

A short video plays, hyping our main event as we are treated to a sneak peek of our main event from last night. It looks like Anderson will face Sano at Full Circle.

The main event ends with both Sano and Anderson bleeding all over the ring.

Post-match, Anderson asks Cabana if he thought Sano might take the easy way out. Sano does exactly that, beating up Anderson and telling him that he should have taken more vitamins.

A video plays, hyping our main event and reminding us that tonight is "full circle." The video also tells us that the last time, the two teams were on opposite sides, but that tonight, we have a different type of main event.

Seth looks cool in that green outfit. He has never looked cooler.

KUSHIDA v. BUSHI:

Our second match is actually two matches. Two, but not three. KUSHIDA is going up against BUSHI in his old home in Pro Wrestling NOAH. BUSHI has held the top ranking in NOAH for almost two years, but KUSHIDA is getting set to take his spot.

This is awesome. Saves a lot of time that other shows usually need to create big moments. They will have a chance to bring in BUSHI's real world opponent, Minoru Suzuki. He is coming in, with his NOAH title, to interfere on his way to challenge at War of the Worlds.

KUSHIDA hits a German Suplex, only to get hit with a dropkick and sent to the floor. BUSHI follows him out, and the two head up to the balcony. KUSHIDA cuts a promo, saying that he should get a better opponent because NOAH is an entertainment company. KUSHIDA tries to get a quick shot in, but BUSHI tosses him over the balcony.

Sano enters the building and makes the save. He gets in his own little promo as he helps the bad boy of Japanese wrestling out of his predicament.

Sano then hits BUSHI with a dropkick that knocks him out. Sano leaves the ring, ready for KUSHIDA to re-enter. He even puts on the jacket to cover the bad boy's identity.

With Sano and KUSHIDA out of the way, BUSHI enters the ring and throws his belt into KUSHIDA's face. BUSHI goes for his belt, and KUSHIDA blocks it. He then gets his belt out of the bag, taking both of their titles with him, but it turns out he took them in the wrong order.

KUSHIDA gets a near fall on BUSHI by grabbing his leg and dropping him with the Stretch Muffler.

BUSHI goes for a brain buster, but can't put KUSHIDA away. KUSHIDA tries to kick BUSHI's head into the ladder, but BUSHI moves his head and KUSHIDA takes a fall, giving BUSHI the pinfall victory.

After the match, KUSHIDA gives BUSHI a big open hand slap, then leaves the ring and goes for the ladder. BUSHI catches KUSHIDA and knocks him out of the ring. BUSHI leaves with both belts, but throws KUSHIDA's belt over the balcony into the crowd. KUSHIDA then slides through the window and comes out behind BUSHI.

Sano and KUSHIDA will be on opposite sides tonight. They are so close, but so far away.

Giant Bernard v. Jeff Cobb:

BRAUN is an up-and-comer who has only had a handful of matches in Ring of Honor. Bernard is known for his ability to bounce around in the ring, and now he is facing a man who uses his wrestling bag as a weapon, much like you would use a pillow.

Since Cobb's recent loss at Survivor Series, we know that he is a talented heel. He is not done in ROH yet, however, as he looks to get back on track tonight.

A "wrestling bag toss" is all Cobb needs to win with a huge pop.

WALTER v. YOH:

Tonight, we will also get a shot at JAY BRISCOE. BRISCOE has said that he will be on the show this week, so I am counting on seeing him.

The match starts with YOH working on BRISCOE's leg. YOH even throws a few drops of water on BRISCOE, as if that was some sort of cheap heat move.

BRISCOE kicks out, leaving YOH without anything to do. YOH responds by punching BRISCOE in the face and then the back. YOH then tags out and goes after WALTER, who is able to hit a nice dropkick. He chases YOH back into the ring, but YOH cuts him off and tags out.

BRISCOE is the legal man. He gets his title up on WALTER's back and then tags out.

WALTER gets the advantage against YOH and takes control until Cobb distracts him. WALTER misses a big dropkick, YOH breaks up the count and WALTER has to go on the offensive again. Cobb is in YOH's face, and YOH is looking for a way to throw Cobb out of the match.

YOH eventually gets the hot tag, and he has enough sense to not get distracted. YOH and Cobb lay in some strikes and leg sweeps to wear WALTER out. They also get him in some submission holds until WALTER finally gets up and gets a brief momentum going.

Cobb gets the hot tag, and he is back to his full form. He turns up the action. Cobb kicks WALTER into his corner, but YOH takes over and starts working on Cobb. YOH throws him around the ring and finally delivers a devastating piledriver.

The match is pretty much over. YOH is the legal man again, and he can do whatever he wants now. This match made me wish we were watching the original War of the Worlds. We need to see this on TV more often.

BRISCOE makes his way back out for the save and kicks out the pin on YOH, even though he was the legal man. BRISCOE gets in the ring and has an epic confrontation with Cobb.

BRISCOE finally breaks Cobb's neck with a big boot, but goes for an inside cradle. YOH catches him with a low blow and then pins BRISCOE in what was a pretty short and sweet match.

Briscoes gets a huge pop from the crowd, as he gets to celebrate with his tag partner. He then celebrates with the fans, and they end up attacking YOH. WALTER then gets up on the apron and hits a big splash off the top to stop the action.

WALTER has his moment of revenge after seeing BRISCOE get dominated on television.
