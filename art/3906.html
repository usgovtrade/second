It is showing an annual loss over the trailing twelve month period at (-39.83%). In this company’s last full calendar year trading session, the stock increased by 10.10%. The stock has a beta of 1.33 and that indicates that a one percent rise in market prices for all stocks would be associated with a rise of 33% in the price of the stock.

The stock has a 50 day moving average of $4.50 and a two hundred day moving average of $8.40. The stock price is $1.09 off of its 50 day moving average. There is a trailing twelve month EPS for Aegis Sciences Corp. of (-0.23).

Investors should consider the fact that this has a P/S ratio of 0.19 which is lower than the sector average P/S ratio of 7.47 and the industry average P/S ratio of 9.10. The P/B ratio is 0.63 which is lower than the average P/B of 1.71.
