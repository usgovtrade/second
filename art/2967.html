Lake County Historical Society Open House and Book Sale, this Saturday at the Historical Society on Route 12 in Lake Villa. Free admission to the Historical Society’s museum, library and collection, including the archives, and grounds. Proceeds will benefit the education and preservation of Lake County history.

In this program, we take a look at American Indians who did not fight in the Revolutionary War. The native community was caught up in the politics of war with Great Britain as much as the colonists. After defeats and betrayals, the natives faced an uncertain future that was a foreboding shadow to the people of the new America.

Greetings from the Punk Side! Just got back from the Riot Fest downtown, but haven't had time to put my thoughts together. I'll give it to you now, while it's still fresh in my mind. This year there were over 200 punk, metal, and alternative rock bands on three days of music all on one stage. This was only the second year for the fest to be held in Chicago, and it was an incredible experience.

It took me two years to finally decide that I'd really like to go to Riot Fest, and I'm glad I made the trip. I came home with a couple of new records, but I took home the most fantastic memories. There were lots of big time bands like Rise Against and NOFX, but I went with a more nostalgic vibe of old friends and memories. The music was fantastic, the people were friendly, and it was just a very punk rock vibe going on. There was a lot of new punk on the bill, like CSTVT and Stray from the Path, but the music didn't match the vibe. The older bands had the best sets by far, and I walked away with some great memories.

So much great punk music was on tap, and it just felt right to be at Riot Fest. I've seen a lot of punk bands come and go, and there are some that I've had a spot on the schedule for more than ten years. It was nice to be back with all the best bands of my youth, and great memories.

Some of my favorite music that played at Riot Fest this year was: Bad Religion, Descendents, Face to Face, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Misfits, NOFX, Punk Rock Bowling, the Queers, Stray from the Path, Samiam, Screeching Weasel, the Casualties, the Vandals, X, Gwar, and The Exploited. I'm not really a fan of Rise Against, but they were on the bill and I saw them. It was an all out punk fest, and I was just glad I finally made it. Chicago always kicks ass.

Another excellent punk album on VINYL from the 1980s. This is going to be a great one to add to your collection. This is coming from the Punk Side.

VINYL: This is going to be a great one to add to your collection. It's a double LP from the '80s, and that's a big deal these days!

The Punk Side records are selling for big bucks these days, and I'm just bringing you the best punk album on vinyl every week for $7. The music world is a crazy place, so grab this while you can. The picture at the top of this post is a vinyl copy of Let's Get it On. Check out the other covers on the next two posts as well.

This album has been played a lot, and is getting older with each play. Lots of songs from the "I Got Bored" album, including Let's Get it On.

And you should know, I have just added a few vintage punk records to the collection. I've been finding great vintage punk records in thrift stores and yard sales lately, but I couldn't resist adding these all time great punk albums to the collection.

One of my all time favorite shows is finally released on DVD. This is one of my favorite concerts, but most people who have seen this show are not aware of this great punk concert. Everyone should check out this legendary show by the Misfits.

The DVD comes with a DVD, CD and LP of the concert. I am including a high resolution download link</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:58
