The guys who lived down there on the street with the beer pong table were always the best friends. I did Basic 2 and Tech school and graduated around 95. I am hoping to go back for a few days over summer vacation to take it all in, it looks like a completely different place now.
I was wondering if anyone out there knew when all the different barracks were constructed. Also where they stood, where they are standing now and what they are currently used for?
I remember seeing this movie when it came out in theaters, I think.
I had forgotten about this movie and would love to see if I could find it on dvd!
Does anyone remember my girlfriend Debbie who was in Ft Jackson with me during Basic training.. We both graduated July of 1991 and went home.. Just wondering if she is still living in the area
We saw the movie as it was being filmed, we hung out with the guys staying on base (when you left the base was locked down!) We all took pictures.
I have a few scenes and a few extras I could send you.
I was in training when this movie was filmed. Great experience. Would love to have more information about it being filmed in SC. I found a website while searching for any more information, but no one has found out why they filmed here.
I did my tech school at Ft Jackson when the movie was being filmed. It was really neat seeing all the extras and stars showing up everywhere we went.
My boyfriend went to Ft Jackson with me, and while we were there the movie was being filmed on base... I have no idea who any of the people are in the movie or anything, but this is still my favorite movie of all time! It's so funny!
So you're wondering if I knew anything about the filming of DAT?
Of course I did! How can you tell someone that is in the Army for 2 yrs that didn't know ANYTHING?
If you could, I would like you to have these photographs.
I'll let you know when I get them, OK?
I was at Fort Jackson in the late 70's, early 80's. This brings back a lot of memories. Loved the movie, although some of it is not realistic....
I was there for 6 weeks in 1992. Never saw any filming going on. Anybody else seen anything??
Went through training in '82 - '85. Went to Panama for a couple years then back to Ft Jackson and finished my stint in '87. My barracks was still the same after all these years, but barracks are now named. The one I stayed in was called "Gentlemen". I remember the bunk being smaller than a twin size bed (mine was). Beret and headgear were worn daily and it's what everyone wore to eat at chow unless they were visitors from the states (weird, huh?).
I remember seeing "Drill Sergeant" when it was first released. Watched it on cable about a year ago. Funny then, still funny now!
I was a private in the US Army when the movie was filmed at Ft. Jackson during my basic training, which was in 1991.
I loved the movie and am currently working with someone on having it released on DVD so that all of us who had the privilege of serving our country while it was being filmed can watch it again!
The movie brought back so many memories of my time in training at Ft Jackson.
I think i went through this site just a few minutes ago. Anyway, I went to Basic 2 July '88, tech school at Ft Jackson '89...saw the movie about a year later and laughed til I cried!! Now, I'm looking for the soundtrack...did they make one? If not I'm gonna record it myself! If you can help please e-mail me and let me know. Thanks.
Went to drill school at FT Jackson in 1992, I am not sure if the movie was filmed while I was there, but the drill sergeants are the same! Also, when I was on liberty at a nearby mall in Columbia, I saw some of the characters that appear in the movie! It was really cool. I would love to get some more information on this, if you have any extra please email me and let me know! Thanks
I lived on Ft. Jackson from 86-90 and went through basic training in 88. It's funny, it still is all like a great nightmare.
I would love to get a DVD of it for my husband to have from me.
I went to Ft. Jackson for about 6 months in '92 and saw some of the filming for this movie but not sure if they were still filming at that point, if anyone has any info or pictures to share please contact me. Thanks
Hey guys, i wasnt even born yet when Drill Sergeant came out but i thought it was a great movie! I would love to find it and watch it. does anyone know where i can find the soundtrack on DVD or VHS or even just mp3 files? Any help would be much appreciated!!! :)
I was at Ft. Jackson from 1991-1992 and went through basic training around the time the movie came out. I LOVED it...and have since seen it about 10 times. I would love to see it again!
Went through basic in 1991. Did not see much of the film being filmed except maybe when one of the drill sergeants was walking around yelling, "STAND AT FULL ATTENTION!"
I attended Ft. Jackson from July 1995 - July 1996 for basic training. While there they had a reenactment of the graduation ceremony from WWII that was really cool. When I was there they did a reenactment of the beginning of boot camp (sounds funny, but it wasn't). You had to do like 3 weeks of push ups and things like that.
I took my daughter to Ft. Jackson and saw the filming of this movie as a bonus. The characters were exactly the same. I can't remember which barracks I was in, but it was one of the ones on the north end of the post. Please respond to my e-mail address, if you have any info or memories of the movie filming.
My mom is in love with this movie - in fact, she even watched it with us for mother's day! - and I'm so glad that I found this website. I might have to purchase her a DVD for her birthday!!!
I would love to find out when the dvd will be released.
I was in basic training at Fort Jackson in 1989 when the movie came out. One of our instructors wanted all drill sergeants from Ft Benning to join us while they were at FSB! There is a line that "goes by" Ft. Benning in the opening scene of the movie that was actually filmed in our training area! I'll never forget it!!!
Hello, I have a question, about this movie. When was it shot?
I am in training for the military right now and this is my favorite movie. I would love to see the DVD when it comes out. Any information on the release date would be greatly appreciated!!! Thanks
my son is going to be at fort Jackson in November for training, would you know if they are going to do some filming there?
Please send any info on this subject to Jodi Johnson at this address: jodijohnson0510@hotmail.com
Hi i`m about to start army boot camp at Fort Jackson, SC and I was wondering if Drill Sergeant was filmed there?? And what barracks did they film it in??
This was my favorite movie growing up and I've been looking all over for a dvd release date or some type of release date. Can anyone out there help me? My name is Lauren and I can't wait to see it again!
I went to Ft Jackson in 96-97 and was stationed at Fort Jackson, what barracks did they use for this movie. I am trying to locate some of the characters. I remember seeing them down town. Some people acted like real drill sergeants and others didn't. I was hoping maybe one of these characters made it into this movie. Thank you for your assistance.
I'm a new soldier going to Ft Jackson in October. Is there any additional information about this movie that might be helpful for me?
I went to Fort Jackson for 7 weeks in October, 1992 for advanced individual training. The only movies i saw being filmed were 2 or 3 movies starring Tom Selleck, a chick flick, and Tom Hanks "That Thing You Do!" I would love to see the other movies that were being shot that weekend, where can i find them?
It is funny to see how different these places are now. I remember going through training in the mid 1990's. It was a little scary for a 17 year old kid from a small town (Salisbury, MD). But the experience was a great one and I would go back in a second!
It would be awesome to see this movie again!! I still remember one part in particular!! It was where the platoon got stuck on a muddy part of the field for hours because they all had tennis shoes on... I was not even born yet...but i remember being in my parent's room when they watched it for the first time..lol
I would love to get in contact with some of my platoon mates that were there around that time. It's always good to look back and remember good times from the past!!!
I can't seem to find anything about the movie being filmed on Fort Jackson. Was it filmed at any other bases in the area? Also, do</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:28
