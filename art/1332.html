What can I say? This is the most intense story I’ve read so far. A really good ending makes you want to read more of the series. This story is also a reminder that people can change, no matter how big a jerk they are in the beginning.

Hi Karen :)

What a great character you have created! Your reviews are just so good!

I really do enjoy reading these reviews. They really help me to see what I need to focus on in future stories. Thanks for taking the time to write this! :)

I do not think it's possible to be a good and evil person. I think it has something to do with the situation and our intentions as we grow up. We can get a raw deal from others or from our environment. Many of the characters in "The Girl on the Train" were looking for love but were rejected for various reasons. That is why I think these characters became twisted and they eventually snapped.

You and your readers are amazing people. Thank you so much for all your positive comments and your reviews.

All the best! :)

You are both very talented writers. I'd love to read more stories from you. I have so many books on my shelf that I haven't read yet! They just pile up every time I read a new book. :))

Thanks so much for dropping by!

Rachel, I do know that many people do suffer from a chemical imbalance. It's scary to think about all the bad things that happen to people. I hope there will be more support groups and education on the disorder. I think if people could be informed and know that the cause is not their fault, then there will be more support and acceptance in society. Of course, you may not like the label "chemical imbalance" but you know what I mean, right?

Anyway, I really appreciate you taking the time to review this book. Your comments are insightful and useful for me as I think about how I can improve my writing in the future. Thanks so much! :)

Thank you so much for all your comments. I really appreciate it.

It's funny. I actually had the opposite reaction as when I first read it. At first, I wasn't impressed but the more I thought about the plot the more I liked it. Once I started on page 1 and got to that last few pages, I was hooked and started the second book in the series.

What surprised me is that there was a lot of action in the first chapter and no "sleeping with the enemy" kind of situation. Like you, I thought something was up in that first chapter. There was a bit of an "out there" vibe. But, I guess he'd had enough of what he was feeling which was anger. It was very clever writing on the part of the author that this character took revenge on the father of the woman who had betrayed him.

Thank you so much for commenting! Thanks for sharing your insights. I really appreciate it. :)

Hi Gwendolyn, Thank you for taking the time to read and leave your comments. I really appreciate it.

I know many people are sickened by violence in real life and that it can really push a person to the edge. The character of Gio has definitely had a hard life. It was great to see him do something about it and fight back. He was trying to fix his mistake from the past, but things don't always work out that way.

Thanks for dropping by to share your thoughts. :)

I really enjoyed this book. It has suspense, violence, sex and revenge! The plot was complex and the theme made sense. It makes sense in a way that I think some novels wouldn't do well. And you know what? I really enjoyed it! I think the author is talented and the author's name is very nice too! It sounds like it means something. It has elements of a thriller, romance, and suspense.

I felt Gio's story was really well done. He was tortured by two people at the same time, yet, he was willing to let one of them die. He didn't deserve it, but he didn't kill her. There was a lot more going on. What was it that made him so desperate? It took me a while to figure out what it was. Then it happened and it was so well done. I loved the way it all came together. It makes sense that he wanted to get revenge. It makes sense that he just wanted her to know she screwed up. The book made me think about so many things and when I got to that last chapter, I was not disappointed because I wanted to know more about her. I had no idea who she was when she walked into the coffee shop. And she also wasn't predictable at all. That was good because when she started showing up it threw me off. The suspense was great, but it wasn't everything. There were so many other elements that made this book great. The love story was so sad and sad in a different way than the other books I've read recently. The love story was what makes me want to talk about this book. He's really torn. He doesn't want to be with her, but he wants to love her. There were so many mixed feelings going on for him that I couldn't put my finger on.

Overall, I thought this book was really good and I think you would enjoy it too.

Hmm, this one is weird. It didn't really grab me at the beginning, but I enjoyed it much more than I anticipated. I mean, there was the violence and the violence-like scene toward the end, but there was also a lot of "revenge" which is one of my favorite kind of books. There were some really great twists in this story, too.

The writing is good, the characters are fairly complex and have interesting motivations and it has something of a Romeo and Juliet type plot.

The only thing that really irks me is how the characters in the story seem to be the way they are by the end, which is not that great an ending since we don't know the fate of that other love interest character, either.

All in all, I think you should give this one a try since it's much better than most of what's on your shelf.

Thanks, Rachel! :)

I had never read a psychological thriller by you before but decided to pick this one up and I’m glad I did. What a unique plot and very well written. Great ending too. Can’t wait for the next book. I look forward to reading more of your work in the future. :)

Thanks!

Such an amazing book! It really kept me reading from the very first chapter to the end. For a first novel it is simply amazing, it kept me on the edge of my seat. I read it in a couple of hours. Wow what an amazing plot twist! I'm already checking the book summary for what is the next installment. If you love this book I highly recommend reading "the truth about him" by Laura Gale! It's also a psychological thriller and worth the read, this is what I call a 'feel good' read!

I loved this book and I couldn't put it down. It was so well written, and the characters are so unique and you can tell that they are not like what they seem. Also, very original. I loved the twist in the story as well. I love that we see both sides of the story. It was a great read! I recommend it!
