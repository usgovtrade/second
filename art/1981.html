"Hi, I'm Still a Person." "They're the original actors." "In the first movie, they played themselves." "They live next door to my grandparents, and they really like the pool in my backyard." "You seem happy." "You know what, honey?" "I am." "I'm happy, and I'm sad, and I have to tell you why." "Well, I don't wanna break your concentration, but I think you should be happy and not sad." "And I say this, and it's something that" "I feel very deeply about, when you look at your wife or the woman that you love, you know, you should be in love with her." "It should be enough." "It should be enough." "And it should be enough that it's there, and it should be enough that it's going away again." "He's really sad right now." "Did I ever tell you how much I love you?" "Yeah, I've heard it." "But it's never enough, you know, like a real married couple." "You should do it for me." "I said, "I do."" "You happy now?" "I am." "So am I." "Hey, thanks for coming to D.C. tonight." "What you've done for gay rights in the last few weeks is gonna really have a lasting impact." "This whole year has been really special for a lot of reasons." "And when I saw you got the Nobel, I just wanna say I'm really proud of you." "Don't think about how many little gay kids are gonna be lifted up by that medal." "Think about all the kids who'll never grow up to tell their story because people like you won't protect them." "No matter how afraid you are, no matter how much a part of you doesn't wanna be out," "like a lot of people who live in D.C., I don't think" "America is as good as it could be until all the gay people can be out and feel like it's a place that they can call home, too." "I'm not afraid, you know." "The day before you started wearing a dress and makeup," "I knew who you were." "And if you need to get married to keep your job, and if you need to keep your job to give kids in D.C. hope," "I'm just not the bigot." "I'm your new..." "I'm your husband, all right?" "So I'm not changing." "I'm staying exactly the same, and I wanna show you this." "Okay." "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait." "Okay, this is it, and this is coming from me, not the guys you've been kissing behind my back." "This is really happening, okay?" "No games, okay?" "No more of these, "I need to think" texts." "Okay, just be in D.C. for three months, and when they start investigating what they've been missing, you could be a married couple." "You can stay here and be on "Meet the Press."" "What?" "I'll be right back." "I'll be right here when you get back." "Bye." "Oh, my God, that was the coolest." "I think that's the coolest." "That's..." "You see?" "Okay?" "I'm going to New York." "I'm going to D.C." "We're so smart, too, huh?" "Yeah, we are, so smart." "Come here, come here." "You do this, right here, I'll never let you go." "Okay?" "All right." "Okay." "Get home safely, I'll see you soon." "Bye." "And then right when the judge is about to close the door on the whole thing, she turns around and she gives me the look." "The whole thing." "I mean, she just gave me that look, honey." "And then everything else goes away." "When my girlfriend, she turns away from me," "I get real quiet because I wanna keep her looking." "It's like all of a sudden, every noise around us goes away." "She's so happy, so beautiful, and so beautiful." "And this is the greatest thing in the world, because we actually get to feel it, not just hear it." "That look you were talking about?" "I think she gave me that look right before I proposed to her." "That was not a good idea." "Are you okay?" "Yeah, it's fine." "I just..." "I just remembered that not everything's as romantic as it seems when you say "I do."" "That wasn't like a movie." "How could you forget, you saw "Moonrise Kingdom"?" "Well, I'm sorry." "I didn't say, "I do,"" "I said, "I do too."" "Yeah, the point of marriage is to be with someone who makes you wanna see all the beautiful movies that you know you should have seen before you got married." "Well, I wasn't gonna say it, but maybe what I really wanna say is that" "it wouldn't have worked out with us, either, you know, if we'd have gotten married and you actually had to do it." "Yeah." "I know that." "But don't you think that maybe you should have felt it before?" "Maybe?" "I didn't know we had to practice our conversation." "You didn't have to talk about it and I didn't have to give you the look." "I wouldn't do that." "You can take your own advice." "Your parents are gonna stay in your room for the rest of the night." "What?" "It's nothing but silence." "I hate silence." "Not you." "Him." "What happened with your parents?" "You better not be freaked out about whatever's happening here between me and Jake." "He was holding my hand." "We went out for a pizza, we shared some popcorn..." "We got engaged." "He dropped popcorn all over my lap." "They both went nuts." "It's a very long story." "I'm going to talk to them, but I've gotta go now." "And that's really all I have to say about that." "You look so beautiful." "I do." "Look at this." "It looks like we're both wearing pink socks." "I know, that's what I'm saying." "I just don't get it." "It's just like..." "You have a husband and now you have a fiance, and I..." "Well, I don't have one of those, so I'm just thinking of you, and if there's something you want," "I wanna do anything I can to help you, or to do it, you know?" "You don't really want to..." "I do want to, and I'm a good man." "I'm not a good woman, but I'm a good man." "I'm not a girl, but I'm trying." "Don't apologize for being straight." "You're not straight." "Yes, I am." "I am." "You're straight as a ruler." "You're straight like you're straight as a bat." "What does that even mean?" "I don't know what that means." "It's just like I have a boyfriend, except I don't, so it's confusing." "You're more like a little boy's type of girl." "Is that what you want me to say?" "I mean, does it bother you when I say that?" "Well, not as much as when you called me straight." "I'm not..." "Okay, it bothers me a little, but it's nice." "You're just a fucking little boy." "I'm sorry." "You know what?" "It's not you, it's them." "It's Jake and my parents." "I think you're a little boy and I'm a little girl, and I can't deal with that right now, and I don't think that we should see each other." "What?" "I think we should take some time apart, you know, and just..." "You can't." "Why?" "Because..." "It's not all about you." "Okay?" "I don't know what happened." "Yeah, well, it wasn't about you." "What do you want me to say?" "That I'm sorry?" "Fine, I'm sorry." "I am sorry." "I know I'm being a dick, all right?" "And you're gonna keep this whole thing with your parents away from my parents, and you're going to keep this whole Jake thing away from Jake, and you're just not going to see me anymore." "You can't do that." "Look at that little girl." "Good." "Why are you guys doing this right now?" "This isn't a thing for you to mess around with, all right?" "This is very serious." "This is me letting you know how serious it is." "Okay?" "Okay, it's not a thing to mess around with." "Well, maybe it was." "Maybe you're the one that's messed around." "We're married now, so I gotta say..." "It wasn't a thing to mess</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:48
