At the end of the fifth season, Vytas was voted out in a 4–2–1 vote in a tiebreaker vote against Dawn Meehan. He subsequently became a part of the jury and voted out Natalie Bolton in a 5–1 vote that same episode. During the sixth season, Vytas was eliminated in the eighth episode after getting the tenth jury vote against Chris Daugherty, and became the third member of the jury.

Vytas' first two seasons involved a heavy focus on strategy. In those seasons, he used his social and strategic skills to form alliances with other players in the game. During his first season, Vytas and his partner Joe Desiree managed to make an alliance with two of the four members of the original Malolos tribe. With the help of alliance member Dawn Meehan, Vytas and Joe Desiree were able to join with two other members of the Malolo tribe, Brenda Lowe and Deana Bennett, to form the Quapaya tribe, while most of the original Malolos joined with an alliance of four players to form the Takali tribe. This new grouping won three out of the first four immunity challenges, including the last two, which gave them the advantage at the next tribal council. As the last remaining member of the original Malolos alliance, Vytas voted against Brenda and Deana at the fourth tribal council. Vytas' closest ally, Deana, ended up winning immunity and was able to sway Vytas' vote against Brenda. When Brenda and Vytas were faced with their final two options at the fifth tribal council, Brenda was eliminated with Vytas' fourth vote. The tribe's biggest threat for the season, Brenda, was eliminated.

Vytas was able to pull off one of the most memorable moments in Survivor history in Vytas' second season. He originally won the fourth immunity challenge and had the right to decide whether he wanted to vote out Brenda or Deana. Vytas attempted to sway the vote to Brenda but was persuaded by eventual winner Natalie White to vote for Deana instead. Ultimately, Brenda was voted out at the fifth tribal council after winning the last challenge of the season.

During his third season, Vytas was sent to Exile Island twice. The first time, he ended up winning Exile Island and decided to break all ties with the game and live in the camp as a free agent. He eventually returned to camp after being convinced to join an alliance by fellow Exile Tribe member Tom Westman. Vytas managed to stay on Exile for the entire duration of the season.

During his fourth and final season, Vytas became more of an activist than strategic player. Though he was aligned with alliances through most of the game, he wasn't involved in the most strategically complex components of the game.

Vytas' first major controversy occurred during the thirteenth episode of the season when he, in violation of the rules, offered to split a reward with a fellow tribe member. The reward would be a trip to an island spa, which would only be available to one member of the cast. Later in the same episode, he also attempted to deceive Jeff Probst as to what the reward would be for his ally Brenda.

Later on in the season, Vytas and Natalie White were the only two members of their tribe left. When he was attempting to convince Natalie to join him in leaving the island, Vytas lied and told her that his tribe had voted her off. Natalie believed Vytas' lie and quit the game.

Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains
Vytas returned to the show for Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. When arriving at the set for filming, it was reported that he claimed to have "come to play". When he arrived on the set, he had to be reminded that he was still under contract with the show, as he was signed for four more seasons after Survivor: All-Stars. This cast was the first one to include returnees from the previously filmed seasons and first to introduce returning players from both the original cast and the All-Stars cast. Vytas returned for the first time since Survivor: All-Stars along with his partner Brenda Lowe. When they arrived at the second Immunity Challenge, Vytas and Brenda aligned with another tribe of four former Malolos. This tribe would eventually be disbanded after a tribe swap. Vytas was very involved in his tribe's gameplay and had a close relationship with Brenda, which did not help their chances in winning Immunity. As a result, Vytas and Brenda were voted out in a unanimous 4–1 vote.

Vytas returned for a second time in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains, this time joined by his teammate Natalie Bolton. Like the previous season, he allied with the Villains tribe and quickly formed a tight alliance with them. When the tribe lost the first Immunity Challenge, Vytas and Natalie's tribe was the only tribe in which not a single member was sent to Redemption Island, where all of the eliminated players were sent to initially. He and Natalie went on to become the only original cast members not to be voted out at all. After being the only two players left on their original tribe, Vytas' tribe was eliminated as a result of a tribe swap. As with previous seasons, Vytas and Natalie were given another chance at the game after returning to the game as All-Stars, due to the fact that they didn't receive a jury vote of any kind. Vytas' alliance was split in half when Natalie decided to quit, which caused the remaining members to vote out Vytas. Vytas' ally, Stephen Fishbach, eventually won the game and was awarded the title of Sole Survivor. Vytas made it to the final three alongside fellow All-Stars players Parvati Shallow and Boston Rob Mariano. Vytas finished in fourth place.
