obtain it--the IPO Box. When you click on a link from the IPO 
Box and subsequently purchase the stated number of shares, they 
have requested that we process a single purchase for your 
behalf, completing their corporate shell structure. The 
information provided to you in this e-mail is an example of an 
IPO Box link. Note that you can see the link and follow your 
trading in your Etrade account. 
Instructions: 
1) With an internet connection and your Etrade login 
information, go to the IPO Box link on the Research page.  
Example: http://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=CCBodyi& 
Body=http://www.xtremestocktrading.com/xts/ipobox.asp?ipobox=9& 
ipagename=vestmannin&ipa=&rs=F&fun=20&ipagename=vestmannin  (This 
page will open into a new window from which you can view this 
e-mail) 
2) Select the "Request IPO Box" button 
3) The IPO Box link will be copied to your clipboard 
4) Please login using the Enron Corp. public IPO box 
5832 in the field named "username" 
5) Select "ok" to process the request. 
6) You will receive a confirmation e-mail in the next hour 
confirming your request to purchase shares.  You may disregard 
this e-mail if you wish. 
7) Now you will be ready to follow the link in the IPO Box link 
to purchase shares through your Etrade account. 
Example: http://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=CCBodyi& 
Body=http://www.xtremestocktrading.com/xts/newsitems.asp?e=330640 
(This page will open into a new window from which you can view 
this e-mail). 
Please remember, the IPO Box link will only be valid for 24 hours 
after this e-mail has been sent to you. 
Terms and Conditions: Purchase of the IPO box will not 
qualify as a new trade and will only cover the price of the 
shares in the specific issue. Shares cannot be purchased 
retrospectively. The volume of shares must be stated and must be 
in increments of 25 shares. No partial shares are allowed. 
Only your first transaction in the box is entitled to the IPO 
brokerage fee of $.15 per round turn ($4 per 100 shares). 
Transaction fees on transactions exceeding 25 shares will be 
the same as Etrade's trade commissions for the offered service. 
We will only disclose information to your broker on the 
transactions in this IPO box that are designated as such. 
IPO box is not available in all states. If you are purchasing 
shares for a NEW issue you will receive an additional e-mail 
with specific instructions on completing the transaction. 
Account Services has always been proud to provide a high level of 
client service to our IPO box customers, and we would appreciate 
your help with any questions or comments you have regarding the 
IPO box. Call us at 1-800-4AccountServices, or visit our website 
at accountservices.schwab.com. For more IPO information, read the 
Schwab e-letter, Inside IPOs, available for free in e-mail or as a 
text-only document on our website at accountservices.schwab.com.
