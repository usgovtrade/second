EMI: an information security management and IT risk assessment regime similar to other European countries

The law in Canada on cybersecurity

By the law in Canada on cybersecurity, internet businesses and companies that keep personal information about users will have to apply for a cybersecurity certificate. The certificate will establish a basic level of security. It will include a privacy impact assessment that the business will have to complete.

The goal is to reduce hacking attacks and to prevent data leaks.

It will also give the Canadian government the power to inspect private data centers and data-storage facilities that are located in Canada. The reason for that is to protect the Canadian privacy of customers.

Is it feasible?

A lot of data breach cases happen because of lack of cybersecurity awareness among employees. The number of employees who will need to obtain a cybersecurity certificate is really large. The task will be impossible for the majority of organizations that are used to relying on the labor force to perform security-related tasks, not to mention data breaches.

To find cybersecurity officers who are specialized in this field may be impossible.

However, one can argue that if cybersecurity becomes obligatory, it means that some businessmen will look for ways to solve the problem. The only way to ensure that cybersecurity is properly implemented is to make the penalty strict and to take security seriously.

The law will raise awareness and make cybersecurity crucial for businesses.

Conclusion

Canadian businesses that provide the storage of personal information will have to meet the new cybersecurity standards. In addition, the new bill will require all internet businesses and platforms to adopt the cybersecurity policy and implement it.

The bill will also establish the legal definition of the digital ecosystem. The digital ecosystem will include all types of devices, software and hardware. To comply with the new law, all of those things will have to be checked and certified. The law is about protecting consumers from hackers. Therefore, there will be new regulations that will ensure the security of IT and data storage facilities.

It may seem as a good decision for now, but itâ€™s very difficult to implement.

Now all the big IT manufacturers will have to think about new systems, software, and hardware and how to integrate them into existing IT infrastructure. If you want to know more about cybersecurity you can watch this video from TechRepublic.
