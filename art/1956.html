1 lb. (16 oz) ground beef (I used 80/20). I like the extra flavor it gives you when mixed with the beans.
*you can use 1 lb. of extra lean ground turkey for a leaner alternative
*If you would like more liquid, add more chicken broth/water.
*If you would like to add a vegetable (or not), chopped and added. Add about 3/4 c chopped raw onion, red pepper, and corn kernels. Or any other veggies you have in the fridge.

1 T butter
*You can substitute 1 t oil instead, if you prefer.
*A pinch of salt and pepper
*Optional: 1/2 t of sugar, cumin, or other spices if you want
*Optional: garlic salt or onion salt if you want.

Heat skillet on high heat, when hot, add chicken or turkey and let brown, turning to cook evenly, until almost cooked. When it's almost cooked, add the onion and green chile. Once the onion has almost cooked down, add the liquid and beans. Once they have been warmed up, put in the bowl of bean and meat mixture to cool off.

Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. While the oven is preheating, take the skillet of beans and meat mixture out of the oven, add a spoonful of beans to taste and taste, and mix well. Bake beans for 10 minutes. Once the beans are cooked, serve in bowl and put 1/2 cup on top of corn tortilla chips. Top with chopped avocado, cheese, sour cream, and any seasonings you like (chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, etc.) Bake for 5 minutes. Enjoy!

*You can omit the chips, add a lettuce leaf instead, serve with a pico de gallo garnish and an sour cream garnish, and enjoy a good meal!

About Me

I am a 20 something college student and I really love cooking, but I think many Americans are missing a basic cooking skill. Cooking is an easy way to experiment with ingredients and come up with new and delicious meals. So many things can be done with leftovers, but sometimes people think that is a shame and throw away perfectly good food. So if this is you, this blog is for you. I will show you how to not only fix old, but also new leftovers into new dishes for delicious meals. I am a college student studying to become a teacher and I plan on teaching my students all these cooking skills. If you ever want to come to me for help, please do and I will be glad to help you.
