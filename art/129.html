thinking about hanging it up before your next promotion.  

On a more serious note:  I know it's been a difficult time, and I know 
you've had a lot on your plate, but with a bit of extra help (that the 
power center can provide) and some good advice from family/friends, you 
can make a big leap forward.  So please consider coming to the center for 
some one-on-one time (maybe even a few nights a week).  Let me know if you 
can come - we will provide transportation to and from the airport or hotel.  

I'll leave you my phone number: (714) 896-7081.  Or, if you prefer, my cell 
phone is 714-296-0765.  I'm not picking up my phone on weekends.  Hope you 
feel up to it again soon!

Sherri,

Thanks for checking on me! I appreciate your concern.

In regard to working things out with my boss, I really can't say that I am
really sure. I am not quite sure what my role is with the "power center"
and I am not sure I would want to put myself back in that position. Also
because I was in a situation before where I wanted to leave, and then my
supervisor told me not to and threatened me. I am not really sure what the
likelihood of that happening again.

I am sorry for the delay in responding, but I have been trying to come up
with a way to respond to you that is respectful of my boss.

Sincerely,

Tiffany Broderick
