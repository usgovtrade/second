" Yeah, with that guy out of the picture, will that thing ever get built?" "I don't know." "Don't worry, we'll get to work on the boat, and maybe after a little while, you and me can take the plunge and find that special someone." "The one that's in the future for us." "You always get me talking about romantic things." "I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry." "What, did I interrupt your happy place?" "We can talk about your happy place any time." " Okay, cool." " Can I help?" "Yeah, you can help with this puzzle." "I'm good at putting puzzles together." "A puzzle?" "Amy doesn't even like to play those." "Amy's away, I'm here." "What's going on?" "I just want to apologize for the weirdness between us." "You been weird to me lately, but I also know that I'm weird, you know?" "But it's just me, I'm not a weirdo." "It's just that when I'm with someone and it's just the two of us, then I get excited and awkward and goofy and I lose all sense of decorum." "It's weird." "I'm weird." "You're weird." "We're all weird." "It's not you." "Oh, okay." "Well, thanks." "Me, too." "And no more weird." "No more weird." "And I'll try not to kiss you on the lips anymore in public." "How does that work?" "Oh, no." "What are you doing?" "How do you know that works?" " Amy?" " No, sorry, it was dark, I couldn't see." " It's okay." " Okay." "No, we shouldn't have kissed in front of our kids." " No, I shouldn't have kissed in front of you." " We shouldn't have kissed in front of each other." "What the hell happened back there?" "Did I just throw the puzzle out the window?" "It didn't feel like it." "I've thrown puzzles out the window before, we should have gone sailing." "What?" "I'm going to go check the map." "So are you gonna go talk to her?" "I am not going to go talk to her, I'm going to order a pizza and talk to her over the delivery guy's shoulder, pretending to be her friend." "She'll see right through that." "All right, fine, we'll go sailing then." "You said I was weird." " I'm sorry, baby." " Just give me a minute." "Well, it was weird." "It was weird when you got weird when you were weird." "I'll try to be less weird from now on." " Okay, I'm sorry." " Thanks for being cool about this." "It is definitely a turn-on." " I'm glad it was me." " Me, too." " Bye." " Bye." " Oh, I'm sorry." " I'm sorry." " That's okay." " That's okay." "I should have gone sailing with Amy." "What's the point of buying a sailboat if you're never gonna use it?" "I bought a sailboat, and I'll never use it." "The point of buying a sailboat is to have adventures, and maybe meet someone who wants to be with you for more than just sex." "Are you talking about me or the sailboat?" "Come on." "Why don't you want to use the boat?" "It's big enough for all of us." "I don't want to be on a big boat with my wife." "It's not like we're married." "I'm talking about when Amy comes back." "Then you'll love it." "Everyone does." "Oh, I was talking about the boat." "Okay, I know it's only been a few days, but what do you think of this?" "Now it's a pirate thing, what do you think?" "Yeah, the shirt and the sweater are fine." "It's the shirt and the sweater, not the pants." " Well, they match the pants." " It doesn't matter." " Well, they match the pants." " They should match the pants." " And then we should take it all off." " I want to go sailing!" "This is not okay, Ryan." "I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore." "I cannot do this anymore!" "Look at me." "I'm so bad for you!" "I'm such a bad person!" "Okay, we're going to talk about this when we get home, all right?" "You're just a guy who's incapable of monogamy." " That's what I need to tell everyone." " No, you can't." "You have to make them understand that I was raised that way." "I cannot change overnight!" " What about the woman at work?" " She cheated on her boyfriend, didn't she?" " I feel like you're missing my point." " Okay, okay." "Did you cheat on me?" " No, I did not." " Ryan, we can fix this." "What does this have to do with fixing us?" "I am just saying that you were forced to be promiscuous, you didn't choose to do it." "You're so stupid." "You know, you're so stupid." "You know what I'm going to do?" "I'm going to tell everyone that you just wear the sweater and not the shirt." "That will be the end of it." "Don't mess with me, Ryan!" "I will ruin you!" "Well, he didn't say anything about the sweater." "I've been here four years, and I still don't know what you guys talk about." "What was all that with you and that hot teacher?" "I was trying to get over my ex." "I thought the teacher could help me do that." "And you do want to be with that teacher again, right?" "It doesn't matter anymore." "How do you feel about Ryan?" "I don't know." "He makes my heart race, he's so cute." " I think I love him." " Me, too." "I can't believe you let her dress me in men's clothes." "Hey, the pants and the sweater have nothing to do with each other." "So..." " So..." " Oh, God." "You didn't have to show up to meet me." "I mean, I could have taken a cab." "God, that's awesome that you just do stuff for me like that." " I guess that's kind of sweet." " Well, you deserve it." "I mean, I'm sorry I haven't been nicer to you." "It's okay." "You can't be a bitch every moment of every day." "Yeah." "Yeah, no, that would be weird." "Yeah, it would be weird." "What can I do?" "What do you want me to do?" "You are so sweet." "I want to get you a nice gift." " Oh, what do I need a gift for?" " Well, it's an anniversary." "It's kind of an important day for us." " Are you all right?" " Yeah, of course." "What do you think?" "I think that you've done a lot of work on that boat over the last two days." "Why don't we just, you know, go sail it together?" " What do you think about that?" " No!" "No, no, no." "I cannot have my heart ripped out of my chest again." "Okay?" "I'm sorry, I just..." "You know, I can't do that again." " You don't even like sailing." " I know." "But it makes me feel so peaceful and connected to the earth." "I love you, man." "I feel like you don't listen to me." "It's like you don't even hear what I'm saying to you." "And I've been talking to you all day about the stupid little things you do that freak me out." "But I think it might be time for us to take our relationship to the next level, don't you?" "You mean your penis is touching my butt?" "No, but that's a good start, so..." "I don't know if I can marry you." "I don't know if I'm ready to marry anyone." "I just need some more time, okay?" "Okay." "Okay." "All right, just let me know when you're ready to be a husband, okay?" "I'll do that." " Okay, that's good, yeah." " Yeah." "Let's try this one more time." "Not that..." "We can do it just this once more time." "Not that." " Okay, good." " Okay." " Okay?" " All right." "I love you." "Ryan, you're such a beautiful man." "I'm so lucky to love you." "Love you, too." "Hey, you guys don't have to be in here." "I just came in to pick up some pants for me and my guy." "Just me and my guy." "Come on." "That was fun." "I really needed that today." "And you should get some pants." "You're wearing the same pants as the day we met." "Yeah." "This is good."</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:48
