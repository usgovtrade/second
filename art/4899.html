Cahill has been on the block since the White Sox drafted Lucas Giolito with the first pick in June's draft. With Michael Ynoa and Zach Putnam set for the starting rotation, Cahill will either start in the bullpen or serve as a long man out of the pen.

Cahill, 30, is 3-8 with a 4.53 ERA over 54 innings this season and is under team control through 2014. He has made $3.25 million in 2012 after he turned down a $5.5 million qualifying offer from the Red Sox.

Banuelos has hit four home runs in 32 Triple-A games and won't be ready to play until the middle of next season. He has posted a 1.29 ERA and 0.97 WHIP in 21 innings for the A's this year, and his value likely outweighs his production in the eyes of a club looking for a power arm like Cahill.

Manzella is hitting .286 in Triple-A, but his season was cut short after a right thumb injury. While he is not necessarily a long-term solution to the Yankees' outfield issues, he could be a fit on the Yankees' bench for the remainder of the season, along with Austin Romine, who has been playing first base at Triple-A in an effort to help the Yankees deal with the ongoing struggles of Eduardo Nunez at the hot corner.

Drury has struggled over the past few months at the Triple-A level, but he could be a big boost for the Yankees' outfield in the second half of the year, as they look to battle for an AL Wild Card spot. Drury was hitting just .254 on the season when he was picked up in the trade that sent Angel Berroa to Seattle last month. He has hit one home run and driven in nine runs over his first 32 games for the Yankees this year.

MLBTR's Tim Dierkes explained that the Sox deal for Cahill was a bit more surprising than the trade of Berroa, as Cahill was only set to make $500K and is likely done as a starter in the majors after 2014. Cahill's salary rises to $5.5 million next season if he has a 10-start season, and $3.5 million in 2014 if he has 50 more IP. But the Sox still could be looking for help to fill out their rotation in the offseason and are the main culprit behind the Berroa swap.
