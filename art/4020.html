An embodiment of the present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device, and more particularly, to a liquid crystal display device having one transistor for each pixel so that light transmittance is controlled by a voltage applied to a pixel electrode using an electric field formed between a pixel electrode and a common electrode, and a method of manufacturing the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
As a widely used flat panel display device, a liquid crystal display (LCD) uses the optical anisotropy and polarization properties of liquid crystal molecules to display images.
An LCD includes a liquid crystal display panel in which a liquid crystal layer is positioned between two substrates. A liquid crystal display panel includes two substrates on which are formed thin film transistors for switching the orientation of liquid crystal molecules. Gate lines and data lines cross each other, defining pixel regions. Each of the pixel regions is provided with a pixel electrode so that the pixel electrode is connected to a thin film transistor.
The pixel electrodes and a common electrode are provided for applying an electric field to the liquid crystal layer. The orientation of liquid crystal molecules can be controlled by the electric field formed between the pixel electrode and the common electrode.
When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal layer, the liquid crystal molecules are aligned to have dielectric anisotropy. As the intensity of an electric field applied to the liquid crystal layer is controlled, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules changes. The changes in the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules cause the amount of light passing through the liquid crystal layer to be adjusted and thus images can be displayed.
In order to control light passing through the liquid crystal layer, the liquid crystal display device further includes a light source, such as a backlight unit, for irradiating light onto the liquid crystal layer.
In general, an LCD is made up of a liquid crystal display panel and a driving circuit for driving the liquid crystal display panel.
In the liquid crystal display panel, two substrates are bonded to each other using a sealant so as to form a liquid crystal cell. The two substrates are typically made of a glass material. In addition, the driving circuit and a lower polarizing plate are attached to the lower substrate of the liquid crystal display panel. Here, an upper polarizing plate is positioned on the side of a viewer who watches the liquid crystal display device.
The driving circuit may be positioned on the upper substrate or the lower substrate of the liquid crystal display panel depending on the type of the liquid crystal display device, i.e., upper substrate type or lower substrate type. When the driving circuit is formed on the upper substrate of a liquid crystal display device, it is referred to as an “inverted type,” and when the driving circuit is formed on the lower substrate of a liquid crystal display device, it is referred to as a “non-inverted type.”
The driving circuit is connected to a plurality of pads for connection with the external driving circuits. The driving circuit includes a printed circuit board (PCB) and an integrated circuit (IC) connected to the PCB. The printed circuit board and the IC are connected using wires such as gold.
A light blocking member for preventing light from being irradiated onto the gate lines, the data lines, and the thin film transistors formed in the liquid crystal display panel is formed in the liquid crystal display panel.
When a liquid crystal display device has a large size, the light blocking member is typically formed on both sides of the printed circuit board, and the side surface of the liquid crystal display device includes a non-display area where images cannot be displayed.
The related art LCD has a disadvantage in that, due to a light blocking member that is attached to the side surfaces of the PCB, the non-display area has a narrower area, thus reducing the size of the LCD.
In order to increase the width of the non-display area, another solution includes eliminating the light blocking member from both sides of the PCB.
However, in this case, as light is irradiated from above the thin film transistor formed on the lower substrate and then passes through the liquid crystal layer, light leakage occurs.
For this reason, a thin film transistor array panel having a structure of bonding two substrates by using a sealant has the advantage that the light leakage does not occur because light cannot be transmitted to the lower substrate of the liquid crystal display panel.
The related art liquid crystal display device has a disadvantage in that, as the upper and lower substrates of the liquid crystal display panel are bonded by using a sealant so as to form a liquid crystal cell, two substrates should be bonded to each other. Thus, there is a limit in reducing the liquid crystal display device in size.
As the two substrates are bonded to each other by using a sealant, misalignment of the upper substrate with the lower substrate may occur. That is, if the upper and lower substrates are misaligned with each other, the liquid crystal layer does not symmetrically contact with a gap of the sealant of the two substrates, resulting in an ineffective liquid crystal layer.
Also, a region of the liquid crystal display panel where the sealant is formed has no display ability. Thus, as the display area becomes smaller, the area of the sealant becomes relatively large, resulting in that more area is not used in the display panel. As a result, the amount of light irradiated from a back light is reduced, thereby deteriorating the contrast ratio and color expression.
In order to overcome the above-described problems, methods of separating the sealant forming region and the sealant are used. As one of these methods, the sealant is formed in a pattern that connects adjacent areas of the liquid crystal display panel so as to form an individual cell. In this case, however, two or more substrates may be misaligned. Thus, a structure of bonding two substrates and then separating the sealant region has the disadvantage of the reliability of the bonding.
Another method is a bonding method that uses a column spacer formed on the substrate and then performing a heat treatment. In this case, however, a problem of shrinkage of the column spacer may occur.
In order to overcome the problem, a method that uses a photo-polymerization by using a high concentration photo-initiator is suggested. However, the photo-polymerization is carried out at a high temperature for a long time. Thus, another problem of thermal damage to the thin film transistor of the liquid crystal display panel occurs.
As a structure for supporting a polarizing plate by using a column spacer, a method that uses a method that uses a polarizing plate made of a composite film of polyimide and inorganic oxide and that uses an ultraviolet curable adhesive is suggested. In this case, however, the polarizing plate must be manufactured separately, resulting in an increase in manufacturing cost.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:34:24
