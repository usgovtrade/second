You see, our city has recently been ranked No. 1 in the world for “quality of life”, according to an annual survey conducted by the Mercer human resources company.

It’s about time we got some recognition. We’re just sayin’.

So, without further ado, here’s the top 10 list.

What exactly does Mercer mean by “quality of life”?

Mercer says quality of life is about more than the economy. “Researchers in behavioural economics have developed the ‘happiness quotient’ (HQ) as a way of measuring the effectiveness of social policies.” Basically, it’s all about how you feel, and Mercer says its quality-of-life measures consider the economic, cultural and environmental circumstances.

The most expensive city in the world

Vancouver is the fourth most expensive city in the world, behind Zurich, Auckland and Sydney. (Tokyo is first.) According to Mercer, Vancouver has the third best quality of life of all the Canadian cities, behind only Ottawa and Edmonton.

Happiest city in Canada

It’s no secret that Vancouver is among the most expensive cities in the world, and most people would be quite surprised to learn that, according to Mercer, Vancouver is also the happiest city in Canada. Here’s a hint for what makes Vancouver so happy: Vancouver is No. 1 on Mercer’s list of “the happiest cities in the world.”

“Life-satisfaction levels in Vancouver are significantly higher than for most OECD cities. Its residents’ scores are not only some of the highest in the world, but also among the highest for any large city population.”

Vancouver has six of the top 20 happiest cities in the world, and five of the top 10. Vancouver is the only Canadian city on the list. (Canberra is the capital city, and it’s number 16.)

Vancouver also has some of the most favourable weather.

Life expectancy

According to Mercer, Vancouver is No. 2 in the world for life expectancy (behind only Japan), with an average life expectancy of 82.8 years. When you hear that, it means people here live longer than in any other city in the world.

Top 10 cities with the most satisfied residents in the world

Satisfaction with life is another key part of Mercer’s annual survey. Here are the 10 cities with the most satisfied residents in the world.

In descending order, Vancouver is tied with Sydney (top), Auckland, Melbourne, Adelaide and Reykjavik.

Mercer suggests that these high satisfaction scores are partly related to the number of green spaces. Vancouver’s large areas of parkland, in particular, are a big plus.

Cultural influence

It’s no surprise that Vancouver ranks so highly on the list of quality of life.

Mercer notes, “Vancouver is one of the world’s top three most internationally influenced cities. This is likely due to the city’s cosmopolitan and multicultural population, as well as its status as a global hub for finance, culture and education.”

What’s wrong with Vancouver?

Vancouver’s high ratings in quality of life can be traced back to its natural environment and a low crime rate.

Here are the rankings for Vancouver (with Vancouver No. 1) in the three major categories:

Vancouver ranks third in the world when it comes to cultural influence. Mercer’s study looks at the diversity of people, languages spoken, music, sports, and literature.

It also ranks second in the world for natural environment, behind only Sydney. “Its people have access to excellent green spaces, for outdoor pursuits, both in the countryside and along the coast, giving them the highest ratio of green space per capita of all the cities surveyed. The vast majority of parks in Vancouver are more than 20 hectares in size, making them very well suited to sports such as running and cycling.”

When it comes to crime rates, Vancouver ranks fourth, tied with Vienna and Stavanger. Vancouver also ranks first in terms of “quality of governance,” which is tied with Sydney and Zurich.

Canada’s Most Miserable Cities

In contrast, Vancouver ranks third for “population growth,” which is tied with Sydney. When it comes to traffic congestion, Vancouver ranks third.

As a Canadian city, Vancouver also ranks first for overall climate (according to the World Economic Forum), as well as for quality of sleep (according to the International Quality of Sleep Index). The survey takes into account climate, safety, health care, housing, education, political stability, social and economic factors, and quality of life.

Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson released the following statement, “We are honoured that Vancouver was ranked #1 in the world for quality of life in a survey that we are very proud of. Vancouver has established itself as a global destination for people to live and work and is the gateway to a thriving region. We know that our incredible natural beauty, our diverse cultural heritage and our warm and friendly people are also major draws to foreign investors, entrepreneurs and travelers. And I’m incredibly proud of the hard work that has come out of the Vancouver Chamber of Commerce to establish Vancouver as one of the most desirable places to live and work.”

A city with a perfect score

According to Mercer, New York ranks first among the largest Canadian cities when it comes to economic and financial market performance, as well as in terms of health and safety, access to healthcare, political stability and quality of governance.

Mercer says Vancouver ranks highest in the world when it comes to housing, transport, natural environment, leisure and culture. However, it ranks lowest in terms of financial market performance, and when it comes to health and safety.

You see, most cities are not a perfect 10.

But there are cities that are perfect.

The Mercer list includes two such cities: Auckland and Stockholm. In each case, Mercer points out that the city’s strength is its “social or cultural environment rather than any tangible assets or resources.”

In a news release, Mercer Canada said, “Mercer’s Best in the World: City Rankings provides a holistic view of quality of life in major cities around the world. It includes a variety of factors that make cities what they are – such as culture, education, economy, society, and the natural environment.”
