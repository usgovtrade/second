“In no more than about twenty years, science will make it possible for man to control the weather.”

This was the prediction of American meteorologist William C. Redfield in the 1930s.

Now there is growing alarm that we may be headed for a new Dark Ages. In a landmark review published this spring in the prestigious science journal Nature, nine leading climatologists called the threat serious, and “potentially greater than that posed by nuclear war.”

The effects of climate change will cascade through the entire global ecosystem. The oceans will rise, causing flooding of coastal cities. Crops will fail. Disease will become endemic in large areas of the world, affecting billions of people.

If the temperature of the planet rises an additional two or three degrees Celsius (three or four degrees Fahrenheit), some argue that is enough to set off the worst effect of the Greenhouse Effect.

As warming intensifies over coming decades, we face a terrifying choice.

Are we going to allow the carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere to rise to levels never before seen on earth, creating a much warmer planet, or do we face what we are most likely to face – a collapse of global civilization?

Will a major portion of the world’s population die out?

How should we respond?

A New Dark Ages or a New Renaissance?

Can we possibly avoid the possibility of worldwide chaos or is the likelihood of such a tragedy already a strong probability?

In this week’s show, we discuss the probability of a new Dark Ages on earth. We also look at the possibility of a new Renaissance on earth.

Are we at an Inflection Point in Human History? Are we in Crisis?

We discuss the state of our global civilization and the world around us. Where are we heading?

In this week’s show, we talk about the current and future conditions of the world. Are we headed for collapse? Can we avoid such a tragedy? What can we do to protect ourselves and those around us from the future?

We also cover these topics:

The Crisis in the Middle East & South America

The Growing Threat of Iran in Latin America

The Crisis in Israel

Can Israel Survive?

Can the U.S. Survive?

What Is Going on in Our World?

Iraq

Syria

The Islamic State

U.S. & Russia

Join the future revolution.

Ian and Mark Green are the founders and hosts of the global phenomenon, “Beyond the Crash”.

Each week, “Beyond the Crash” takes an in depth look at one specific economic and financial issue that affects your life, your family, your career and the global economy.

“Beyond the Crash” shows you how you can successfully navigate the financial waters ahead and how to make the best choices for your financial future.

“Beyond the Crash” has been recognized as one of the top new media businesses in the United States. It has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, on Fox Business and in many other leading media outlets.

And now this week, we talked about

Gold and Silver and its place in today’s economic landscape.

We discuss the fundamentals of gold and silver and their place in the current global economy. In this age of low interest rates, are metals your best choice for protecting your wealth?

Join Ian and Mark to find out.

We also talked about

The global debt problems we face today.

We talk about the current debt crisis facing the world, but what about the future? Can the world get itself out of this debt trap? Will we see hyperinflation?

We look at the debt and the bailouts and “printing” of dollars we have experienced in the last decade. What will be the new phase of the current economic crisis? Are we headed for a global crash?

Then, we look at the real estate crisis that is still sweeping the world and discuss the causes of the 2008 Crash and the possible effects of the “bubble” popping.

We also look at the collapse of the energy industry in the United States, and its impact on the U.S. Dollar.

Plus, we cover the continuing threat of the terrorism,

As we have seen the terrible events on September 11, 2001, many people still fear for their lives, especially people living in the Middle East. What can we do to prevent a nuclear attack by terrorists?

We also discuss

The new world order of Vladimir Putin.

We review the political development in Russia and the threat this development poses to the entire world. Will Russia join the BRICS alliance? Can Russia join the new world order? Will Putin unite the world or will he create chaos?

In this week’s show we talk about the future of money and the current state of our economy and global civilization.

Last week we wrote about the economic and financial meltdown we have recently seen in South America and Eastern Europe, as well as in the United States. We discussed the causes and effects of this meltdown, including:

Russia’s economic policy of devaluation of the Ruble

Sterling and its effect on the U.S. dollar

The debt and inflation crises in the United States

The financial failures of Wall Street and major corporations

The effect of this meltdown on the “normal people” and the poor.

We discussed some of the solutions to these financial problems, and how we may avoid a complete economic collapse.

We are now in a time of crisis for our financial institutions. We have seen the collapse of entire industries and the destruction of their worth.

In this week’s show, we continue to talk about our current economic meltdown and the current and future state of our economic system. We also look at what we can do to escape the situation and avoid a total collapse.

Also in this episode, we will take a look at gold and silver and their role in the global economic and financial systems today. We will talk about gold’s value in the current global system.

And we will share what other investors and analysts are predicting for the next major</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:50
