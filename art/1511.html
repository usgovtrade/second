12. A student's reaction to the problem of boredom varies from class to class. In some classes there are a few who never experience it. In other classes boredom is not unusual. We can't predict just who will experience boredom.

19. In his talk at Michigan State University, A. P. Elkin noted that there is considerable boredom in all walks of life. People who are working are at a risk of experiencing boredom when they finish a job; students have to go through periods of boredom when they are reading. Elkin's analysis is the best available.

20. Elkin, "Boredom," p. 50.

21. One of the ways in which teachers create boredom in their classes is by having students fill out forms and answer questions that are not relevant to the topic. The teachers often think they are helping students to get some needed information, but they are not using the teaching process to accomplish the objectives. When they have students fill out such forms, they are using the class as an empty data collection mechanism.

32. In our times most high schools have courses in "General Studies" or "Civics." Most of the time the curriculum in these subjects is not exciting; the curriculum has become stagnant. This means that the students may not want to be in the class and may not participate fully. It is too easy for a teacher to assume that everything is going well in a class that has nothing exciting going on. We need to develop a new curriculum that will require students to be involved in the most important problems in the society. The most important function for the teacher is to stimulate the interest and curiosity of the students. This can only be done if the curriculum is constantly open to new problems.

34. In his talks in the mid-1960s at Michigan State University, Albert Elkin used the term "laughable" (L-A-U-G-H-E-B-L-E). He said that in one college a teacher was using a television program as an example of satire. A student said: "You mean you expect me to laugh when I hear my president being made fun of?" In a course I teach, where I show a political cartoon to explain satire, I have the same student say to me: "Isn't this the kind of stuff that makes young people want to go out and kill people like you?" I find that the students who get a full explanation of the concept of satire, or laughable, are usually less critical than other students.

56. In the preface to _Fear and Trembling_ , Kierkegaard wrote: "The point is the leap—the leap of faith, the leap from the universal to the particular, the leap which no one has yet ventured and no one has yet believed possible."

59. The teacher has to avoid the temptation to jump immediately into the "facts," but rather to ask questions and make observations. Then, after the student has made his or her observations, the teacher can ask further questions to clarify the thoughts and conclusions reached. In a way, the teacher should not make any judgments at this point, but allow the student to reach the conclusions. In this way, a student will be free to think through the issues rather than being restricted by the teacher's knowledge. The teacher has to maintain an attitude that permits the student to think rather than to jump to conclusions.

60. I am not advocating a method of presenting information in classrooms where information is given without any interpretation. Nor do I advocate a method in which the teacher tells the students what to think. But I am suggesting that teachers use a method that provides enough information for the students to come to conclusions, but that will allow the students to come to the correct conclusions without any pressure from the teacher.

63. In our society we have all too often seen the consequences of following these rules, especially when the teachers are not well prepared. In the spring term of 1948, while a college senior, I visited a cousin in Minneapolis. The previous year he had taken a course from a professor who taught Shakespeare. In his course, he had students go to a local theater to see a performance of _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ , one of Shakespeare's most famous plays. My cousin said that the play bored him so much that he didn't enjoy it at all. However, when he read the play for a class in college, he realized that the writer was talking about a world in which people did things by routine rather than</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:04
