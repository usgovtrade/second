We love to celebrate and reward the hardworking members of our Guitar Center family. That’s why Guitar Center offers a monthly drawing in support of the MusiCares Foundation, where a $5,000 grand prize is awarded to one lucky winner every month. But we also celebrate the fun, quirky and amazing hobbies of our community members. That’s why we hold the monthly “Play to Win” giveaway. This is a chance to walk away with prizes every month of the year, just for playing your favorite hobby. Prizes include gift cards, guitar gear and more. Sign up for free and enter your information each month to be automatically entered.

A word from Robert Scovill: “Play to Win has been a great addition to our current promotions here at GC, and we’re excited to continue bringing new contests and special opportunities to our customers,” says Robert Scovill, director of marketing. “Since this has been running, we’ve had a wide array of customers play our weekly contests and some even win more than once. Of course, the weekly giveaway has been a big success, too. All the customers have enjoyed hearing the latest tunes and some of them are even playing the winning song and uploading videos of themselves performing.”

Here’s what’s happening at Guitar Center and in our Guitar Center social communities. You can always be sure to find the latest news, promotions and more on the Guitar Center Facebook page and Guitar Center Twitter account.

“The GC staff really make this contest fun and exciting. I entered the contest and not only had a good time but won too!” – Caleb

I love our local Guitar Center in Denver. I’ve made many new friends at this Guitar Center and was asked by a great guy, who worked at GC, to do an interview with him for his son’s website. It was a nice article I was involved in, written by Ryan Hester, the son of this great man, who loved playing guitar.

“Music is an integral part of Guitar Center culture. Guitar Center has many different employees that are musicians in their own right, including one of our senior managers here in Denver, who just happens to play the banjo. The managers like to give out instruments to customers to encourage customers to play. At other times, customers will come into the store and be playing the guitar before they can even find a sales associate to help them. Most customers will go home with a new instrument or accessories!” – Ryan Hester

As many of you know, we are a family owned business here in Denver. I, Robert Scovill, was just named director of marketing for Guitar Center. It was truly a humbling experience for me to be chosen to take the helm of the marketing department for our company and our family.

We have a lot to accomplish as a company and I am excited about my new role and the challenge of leading this team at Guitar Center. Thank you to all of our customers who have voted for me to become the company’s new marketing leader. I look forward to serving our customers and making them the top priority at Guitar Center. I’m so excited to lead this team and look forward to accomplishing great things for our company, our employees, and our customers.

I love writing and playing music, and can’t imagine a more amazing and fun way to bring both into my life. After starting as a rock band and taking a break for several years, I started playing guitar again in college and I’ve been hooked ever since.

As a drummer, there are few things I enjoy more than getting out on the stage and seeing my band playing the music that I write for them and the fans, and there’s nothing like performing to an audience who has truly been won over by the music we create together. The excitement of a new fan is one of the coolest things to ever happen in the life of a rock musician.

This year alone, I have played two concerts in front of audiences of hundreds of people, and when you are in the middle of a sold-out show, you realize that everything leading up to that moment was to bring the music to the people and bring the people to the music. It is a great feeling to know that you had a part in giving something so special to people, and in providing an experience they will remember for the rest of their lives.

As we prepare for the new year and new opportunities, I’m honored to have the chance to be nominated in the category of “Musician/Artist” for the “Best of Denver” awards here at Guitar Center. It’s no secret that I’m a big supporter of local business. It just makes sense that people in Denver support a local business, just like me. I’m honored to be nominated for this award. I hope you all will stop by and support my company at Guitar Center for this opportunity, and vote for me if you are able!
