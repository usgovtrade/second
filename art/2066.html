Many of the most popular commercial dog foods are produced by large industrial concerns that are not always forthcoming with what is exactly in the food. Many popular “healthy dog foods” are made up of grains and fillers that can be lacking in certain essential vitamins and nutrients (the same concerns over commercial pet food can also be held for cat foods).

For example, if your pet is prone to developing allergies to grains, this is an important factor to be aware of. With grain-free or corn-free diets, your pet could end up being allergic to the fillers used to replace the grains and end up feeling worse instead of better. The quality of ingredients are also important to note. Ingredients that are listed are not always a guarantee that the ingredient will be in every bite and it can be more difficult to find a brand that works with your pet's breed.

If it is your pet's favorite food or an over-the-counter medication that needs to be switched out, talk to your veterinarian about the possibility of switching brands instead of abruptly stopping the current food or medication. Just be sure to work closely with your vet to make sure you're making the best choice for your pet.

When feeding your pet, make sure you weigh and measure the food, and measure out an appropriate amount for your pet. Many of the healthier and grain-free pet foods come in larger sized packs and if you're not careful you may end up buying an extra amount.

Finally, consider visiting your local pet food store and talking to a sales representative about their products. Sometimes you get more bang for your buck when you buy direct from the manufacturer. The pet foods made by our veterinarians are great, and our vets can help you find the best food based on your pet's particular needs.
