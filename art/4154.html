Why a pointer cannot be dereferenced in a function argument of another pointer?

Consider this function:
int myfunc(int *(*p)()) { 
  return p(); 
}

When calling the function as myfunc(&foo) the value is returned to the caller.
But, when I call the function inside another function, myfunc(func()) and call the function pointer p as func(), I get a runtime error. Why is it so?

A:

*p is an rvalue, it doesn't point to a valid object, so the call p() dereferences an invalid pointer.

A:

Dereferencing a function name (function pointer) is an unary operator: it returns a function and does not affect any arguments, while a function call expression which has an explicit parentheses after a function name is a binary operator that has an lvalue as an operand: it returns a pointer to the object.
Now, if the object is a prvalue expression, the unary * can be applied to that; it is the same as writing &prvalue. When prvalue is a pointer to function type, the value of *prvalue is the address of that function, which is again a function pointer. However, when prvalue is a pointer to data type, *prvalue is equivalent to the indirection operator.
This means that
&*p

is the same as
*(p())

which means that p() will return a pointer (lvalue) to the function. But p() is not a pointer to function type; it is a pointer to function type, thus giving you a rvalue. So when calling func(), the type of p() is a pointer to function type, and is not the same as a pointer to function type and thus the type is illegal. This is your error.

When func() is called with another function pointer p, an additional argument of type int(*)(void) is implicitly passed to the function: an integer argument.
Here's an example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int func(int (*p)(int)) { return (*p)(); }

int main() {
    cout << &func << endl;
    cout << &func(function<int(int)>()) << endl;
    cout << &func(&foo) << endl;
}

Since we used a function instead of an object, the function name became a function pointer to an int(int) function (which is legal to pass to func()). The parentheses tell the compiler that we're passing a function pointer instead of calling it.

So, the function calls are
void func(int (*)(int))
cout << &func << endl;
  |             |
  |             |
 |         lvalue         |
 +-----------------+      
       i      p    +-----+
       |             |
       |             |
       |             |
 +-  x----v-----+----+
 |                 |
 |                 |
 +-----------------+
  |         int   |
  p()       int   +-----+
          ^
          p
          |
          |
          |
          +-----+
             |
             |
             v
       void*

The output for the first call is 1:
int func(int (*)(int)) { return (*p)(); }

We have the call to the function template.
So we get:
int (*)() { return p; }
int (*)() { return p(); }

and the first call is equivalent to 
(*func)()

which is what we have. Thus, the type is int(*)(int).
In the second call, we take another pointer:
int func(int (*)(int)) { return (*p)(); }

We add the parentheses to signify the argument type. Again we have the function template with the type int(*)(int).
As a side note, the value of func() is also 1. If you put a * in it, you get the address of func().
The following:
int func(int (*p)(int)) { return (*p)(); }

is also equivalent to:
int func(int (*p)(int)) { return p(); }

which is nothing more than a function template taking a function pointer and returning a function pointer.
*p returns a function pointer. When called, it will return the value of p(). The value of p() returns an int (*)(int) which is a function pointer. However, p() is not a function pointer; it is a function pointer to data type.

The third call passes another function pointer:
int func(int (*p)(int)) { return (*p)(); }

*p returns a function pointer and in this case it is not compatible with this function template and thus the call to p() is an error.

A:

This program has undefined behaviour and it fails.
char x[4] = {1,2,3,4};
int func(int (*p)(int)) { return p(); }

int main() {
    int (*q)() = func(&x[1]);
}

The output is:
0x7ffe55420000

Program terminated with signal SIGABRT, Aborted.
#0  0x7ffe55420000 in func() at test.cpp:3

If the function has the prototype int (*p)(int), then it cannot accept an argument of type int(*)(int). In this case, the argument is a function that returns a function pointer to the type int(int). It can't return a function pointer to a function of the type int(int) since it's illegal for function pointers to be declared with variadic parameter lists.
If the function has the prototype int (*p)(int), then it can accept a function of type int(*)(int). In this case, the function is a function that returns a pointer to function type int(*)(int).
