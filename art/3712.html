<p>In fact, a version of “Born to Rock” was released by Michael with <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Jami-Christian-Tobacco-JCT-2000/release/1012465">Jami Christian &amp; The Tobacco</a> for their self-titled 1989 LP (see <a href="http://thecigarsofdoom.blogspot.com/2009/12/jami-christian-and-tobacco.html">The Cigar of Doom</a> #44). Now, the track from Jami's album has resurfaced as a demo from the same time. Both tracks feature the same vocals and guitars with the only difference being that Jami's track has more distorted vocals on the refrain.</p>

<p>The same song with different lyrics but a great song nonetheless.</p>kevanlilyhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BirthdayPresents/comments/e2r4j9/born_to_rock_on_jami_christians_1989_album/ccq3c1c2012-12-28T08:08:42.483967-05:00Oh the irony.. the band's name is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVU-mG7iTjI">Mandatory</a> that's how I first got to know about them...http://www.reddit.com/r/BirthdayPresents/comments/e2r4j9/born_to_rock_on_jami_christians_1989_album/ccq3d2q2012-12-28T12:34:26.464981-05:00I have a feeling people have been posting this all day.http://www.reddit.com/r/BirthdayPresents/comments/e2r4j9/born_to_rock_on_jami_christians_1989_album/ccq3c_u2012-12-28T23:07:26.387033-05:00No idea how people knew about this a year ago and I only just got to this thread.http://www.reddit.com/r/BirthdayPresents/comments/e2r4j9/born_to_rock_on_jami_christians_1989_album/ccq35n1kevinlilyhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BirthdayPresents/comments/e2r4j9/born_to_rock_on_jami_christians_1989_album/ccq35n12012-12-29T16:28:23.281772-05:00Maybe it's a sign of the times that more people found this song this year?
I found this in 2012.

I heard the song at a friend's house in '97. I was 13. It seems like it's been out there forever. I actually heard it in a different form ("Born to Rock" by "Mandatory").
"Born to Rock" was released as a song by Wax on Wax in 1989. "Jami Christian & the Tobacco" released their self-titled album on CSC in 1989. Both bands covered that version of the song.
In 2009 "Born to Rock" by Mandatory was released. Mandatory was not known as Jami Christian or Tobacco. It was unknown which versions of "Born to Rock" were theirs.
Either way... a great song that shows off some classic-rock goodness.kevinlilyhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BirthdayPresents/comments/e2r4j9/born_to_rock_on_jami_christians_1989_album/ccq5u8d2012-12-29T23:48:59.471811-05:00I think this and Michael Jackson's other covers are the best songs from that album and I love how both versions of this song were on their album. And I love the video (still love the new version too, BTW).http://www.reddit.com/r/BirthdayPresents/comments/e2r4j9/born_to_rock_on_jami_christians_1989_album/ccq5ur5kevinlilyhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BirthdayPresents/comments/e2r4j9/born_to_rock_on_jami_christians_1989_album/ccq5ur52012-12-30T08:03:58.344927-05:00When did the new cover come out?
