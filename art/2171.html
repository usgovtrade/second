Forge Motors has a great selection of modern and classic racing wheels and rims. These are available in many different sizes. I can't say enough about the quality and performance of Forge Motors.

A number of people have been inquiring about the vintage Vintras in our Vintage Parts section. We now have two Vintage Vintras available. These are both 1960s Vintage Rallye Cars. One is a 1965 Vintage Mini Popsicle Vintage Rallye Car and the other is a 1966 Vintage Mini Coed Crusader Vintage Rallye Car. Both the Mini Popsicle and the Mini Coed Crusader have great history and are absolutely stunning automobiles. We have not listed these on our website, but I can email you a picture if you would like. The Vintage Mini Popsicle and the Vintage Mini Coed Crusader both do great in our Vintage Racing Car Simulator, or if you just want to hang out in them. Both cars are available for sale and a good price on these is $28,000. You can find these by clicking the links below.

If you don't find what you are looking for on our website, please contact us. If we don't have it in stock, we can try to locate it for you. You can email us at the address below. We would appreciate your input on our site and any suggestions you might have. Our goal is to have everything we sell available for purchase on our website. However, that might not always be possible. If you see something you are interested in on our site, but it isn't listed as available, please don't hesitate to ask us. We really try to not sell things that are no longer available, but it sometimes happens. I don't know if it is because people have passed away and there is no one to make the parts or sell them anymore or it is simply because a particular part is no longer available, but we don't normally list things that have gone out of production.

If you don't see something on our site, you can email us or call us. We are happy to make parts available for our customers and can usually order something that is in stock from our vendors if you are willing to pay the cost of shipping.

This is a listing for a 1966 Mini S2 Supercharger. This car originally came from the United Kingdom in 2011 and was never registered. We have not been able to track down the original owner so this car is being offered for sale by US Collectibles. We are auctioning this car off and the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association. We are hopeful that if we have a successful start on this auction, we will be able to buy additional cars to put back on the road. This car would make an excellent Supercharged Mini or it can be used as a stand alone. The Supercharger can be removed from the engine bay</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:05
