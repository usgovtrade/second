Airlines, airline companies, and regulators need to accept responsibility for their actions, by not using these people and not making them "experts".

Seriously, if I am going to be at a large airport for 15 hours, then I will find something to occupy my time. I will not be a sullen person demanding "expert" treatment. What a load of BS. If you want to be treated like a VIP, then be on time, don't whine and complain, and don't show up late.

Why does having a "Drill Sergeant" matter? You have all the training you need before flying your machine. If you are not trained, then you are not qualified, period. So if you make an agreement with an airline that includes making your pilots into expert drill sergeants by throwing "Drill Sargents" at them, then that is your responsibility. It is also your responsibility to make sure that the Sargents know what they are doing, or else you have an incompetent or malicious individual to deal with.

Why don't you just "Get over it"? If you can't do that, then "Go home and deal with it".

Do the "Drill Sargents" make your planes safer? Not if you treat them like garbage. If your pilots are trained well enough that your aircraft are safe, then it is time to stop making a fool of your pilots and to stop complaining about the behavior of the airline.

Airlines treat their pilots and cabin crews as valued assets that are in great demand, so that when your plane arrives on time, passengers will pay the higher price that the airline wants to charge. There are not many airline companies that can say that about their pilots and cabin crew. It takes skill to handle a large, complex piece of machinery with thousands of others in it. That takes training and practice. When you make these people into experts that give "Drill Sargents" on the aircraft, then your pilots will have to do that. Maybe they are not so great at giving instructions and are great in taking orders. If that is the case, then the airline company can fire them, no one cares.

Airlines are not charities. The pilots and cabin crew are employees, not charity cases. If your pilot is trained enough to be hired by the airline, then he or she is qualified. If not, then the airline needs to find people who are properly trained, not sullen, lazy, or incompetent people.

There should be minimum standards that must be met in order to be a pilot. One example is that a pilot must have a pilot's license and have experience flying an airplane for at least 3 years. There should be standards that a captain of the aircraft needs to fulfill in order to fly an aircraft for commercial aviation purposes, standards such as having proper training, being proficient in communicating with other people, or having knowledge of aircraft systems. What the airlines are doing by hiring trained pilots is very helpful to those who do not need such special treatment, especially for airliners and passenger jets. That is not a joke! You do not know if you are going to be on the same plane as someone who crashed. I am not sure of all the other reasons, so please explain if there is more that I missed.

Drill sergeants were responsible for keeping pilots in top form on military bases. Why does a commercial airline need to have that practice? Does your mechanic need to have a drill sergeant make sure he knows how to change a filter on an engine, or is that his job?

When there are serious situations, then an airline would keep the aircraft on the ground if the pilot refuses to take off because the person is not qualified. Why does the airline always need to get off so easily if there is an emergency? Because if they take off, then they have to pay for it and if it goes wrong, then it's the airline's fault.

When you get on a plane, and the flight crew does not know your name, then you are not a VIP and you should expect to get the same treatment as the passenger in front of you. That includes not getting special treatment and also to not be given a lot of attention. If you are so important, then make sure that your pilot knows it.

What do you think is the reason for the airline pilots to treat passengers in such a way? Is it their way of being sullen? Is it their way of getting back at the company? Is it their way of being lazy and having a problem with getting their way? Or is it the simple fact that people do not like to be treated as if they are inferior, when they have no other choice in getting where they want to go.

Do you think a pilot is going to fly the plane more safely when he or she is being screamed at because he is not able to show up on time, doesn't know how to treat other people, and doesn't get the respect from his coworkers. Do you think a pilot would fly the plane safely and not act sullen because he or she is "Drill Sgt"?

So, what does the Drill Sergeant mean?

Well, a drill sergeant in a sense is someone that is there to enforce rules and regulations. A lot of times, drill sergeants are there to get people ready for combat. Some people would say that the Air Force is not combat. That isn't true. In the Air Force, it is very common for a drill sergeant to use violence in order to get a job done. Some people say that violence and combat should not be present in commercial airplanes. In most cases, I would agree with that sentiment. The airplane is a commercial vehicle. It isn't combat, but it is not a place where people go to relax, either. It is usually an extremely competitive environment with people trying to get a job done, get passengers where they want to go, and get out of the building.

I do believe that people should show courtesy. Some pilots scream because they feel the need to express their anger. If someone had told me that I would fly an airplane, then another person screamed at me that I was incompetent, I would tell them to go fly their airplane and then we could argue about it, but I would be getting off. Instead of going to another airline and letting them take the plane away, I would be very hesitant to take that path.

I'm not so sure. If your pilot is in training, then that is a very good thing. If you are flying an aircraft and the pilot was not in training, then there could be some issues involved. However, in that case, a pilot should still be able to handle the aircraft without incident. As long as there is not an emergency situation, then it is very likely that the airplane will be handled well. If there are safety issues, then you should know about them because the airlines do have that kind of training.

What do you think is the answer? You have it, I can tell by your post! Do you think it is a good idea for commercial pilots to have pilots that are trained to serve as "Drill Sergeants"? I am open to other ideas, though.

The only thing I can think of is that those that work for the airlines can't stand to deal with the passengers so they have these special people trained to deal with them.

I agree that if a commercial airline pilot does anything wrong, then it is the responsibility of the airline to find out and deal with the pilot in question. It is not right to have someone do something wrong, in my opinion. I would think that most airlines have that situation pretty well under control.

It's kind of hard to believe that people don't know that people don't act that way if they are getting something out of it. They take advantage of people who will fall for it. Sometimes, people get away with things that they shouldn't get away with and it is not their fault. That is human nature.

As much as you may think that you are being treated better when the airlines treat you as if you are a valued asset, then they are just treating you like everyone else. There are not many people on an</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:47
