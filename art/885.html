have to go to the doctor."

Gently but firmly he pressed on the pistol muzzle.  It was 
impossible to tell how far the weapon might be loaded, but 
he could not be sure of its safety, and while making any 
pretence at a struggle in which his fingers might have been 
mangled or broken, the muzzle could be pulled the least 
fraction of an inch forward, and--

But again he did the wise thing.  "I'll look first.  Take 
your hands off that weapon.  I'll look."

The girl obeyed his gesture, but he dared not trust her.  
He must be quite sure of his ground.  He turned to the
door, crossed to the wall, and looked round it.  The place 
was lit by one of those electric lamps that do not illumine 
more than a few yards round, and that were so common once, 
but have, with all the great increase of civilization, become 
almost as scarce as savage tribes.  The electric current, in
fact, was so weak that it hardly extended at all outside the 
house it served, a common defect in the wiring of all the
older suburbs. The next lamp, but half a mile distant, gave
out a much more brilliant illumination.  There was enough,
however, to show him that he was alone. Even a second's 
hesitation would have told him that, had there been any one 
else within the radius of the light. Then he turned round, 
put up the pistol, and said again, "Now, quick. You must 
understand that I cannot spare you even a second. It is 
absolutely necessary that you should be released."

"Look here, Jasper Treverton. I don't know what has 
happened--but I've had enough. I know this place; my sister 
used to stay here often. I was brought up in the country, and 
I know this house. Do you want to go inside, or shall I go 
for the police?"

Jasper paused. It was all very well to talk about the girl's
safety. He had not a shadow of a doubt that if he let her go,
before he had cleared the air, she would give the alarm to 
the police. He hesitated for a moment. 
"No--this is my business," he said at last. 
"Nevertheless, you can render me the greatest assistance. If 
I leave you, where are you to go?" 
"My brother's. I know where he keeps the key. You need not 
be afraid of being betrayed. I have only got to call a cab, 
and be off."

"Very well. Let us go. This way." He led the girl out of the
house.

"Keep quite close to me," he said, when they were in the
street. "I may have to act on the spur of the moment, and 
must not leave you behind."

They soon reached the cab stand. "Your sister's key, cabman.
Now, I'll leave you to look after your niece. I hope you 
understand what I am telling you?"

The cabman, who had already been informed of the number of 
the house, and was not easily to be taken in, laughed aloud. 
"You're as safe as a church, sir, inside that place. I've 
been driving my cab here six weeks past, and I know all the 
houses round. There's not one in twenty that has not got
policemen in and out of it at all hours o' the day, and, if 
you was to walk in, you'd be a burglar before you knew you 
was one."

"I shall not walk in. You are quite mistaken. I am not going
to set foot inside that house."

"Yes, you are." Jasper's voice grew very stern. "You are
going inside that house--and if you open your lips, by
Heaven, I will fire on you myself!" 
"What is the matter?" said a voice behind him. 
"Anything wrong?"

Jasper sprang round, and found himself face to face with the
doctor. 
"Anything wrong?" repeated the doctor.

Jasper stared at the man. "No--no--nothing!" he said.
"Nothing--except that you are a burglar in my hands."

"What do you mean?"

"You, and your accomplice--that woman there--have plotted to
rob this house." 
"Why, how's this? I knew you were a friend of mine, but I
wasn't aware that you had taken to my sort of business."

"Do not trifle with me, sir. You are not the kind of man I
expect to find here, and my presence in the house is likely
to be noticed. I ought to give you in charge for house
breaking."

"Well, well; howsoever! Come! What is it you want?"

"We want that girl who was here, the other night, when I
heard the conversation of that woman over the garden wall. 
I believe she had a hand in the matter, and I know that she 
has been carrying on a correspondence with a prisoner, 
confined here in the 'squire's house, in this neighbourhood. 
I want that girl."

"She has gone."

"Where?"

"I don't know."

"It is false! She has gone to your 'sister'--it was she who
opened the door to you, eh? Out of the house?"

"How do you know that?"

"I have seen her go out; and she has gone to your 'sister.'
She has told her all about me, and asked her to give her 
shelter. What do you say to that, eh?"

"What do you say to it yourself?"

"That the girl will be easily found, as she will return to 
your sister's--because she will trust her. This, as you can 
see, is a trap for me--but not for you."

"And who made you the master?"

"Thank you. It was a good morning's work."

The doctor paused a moment. He had made up his mind to risk
nothing by any open violence. The burglar had gone, and he
was alone. He might get shot by some foolish youngster, or,
with a dozen chances against him, he might have trouble in
getting through an hour. In any case, when his back was
turned, the lady would escape. So he said quietly, "Come, 
that's over and done with. You have brought me here to tell 
you the truth--to give you the girl, and a cheque for 
L500--if you think that is too much, you can send the girl
back again."

"I don't take you for a fool," said Jasper, sharply. "And 
what is the use of fooling about the cheque? I want the girl,
and the L500, and--and anything else you have got in your
possession. Be quick and send her."

"Then, you may as well let me get the stuff and see my 
prisoner safe and sound--and without another moment's delay.
What you have got to pay the girl is L1,000 in a banker's
cheque, and----" 
"We can talk about that in due time." He stopped the man
before he had done, and whispered-- "You are not a sneak, I
believe, Mr. Doctor, or you would let me go off now and
leave you to pick up my menaces and wait till another time. 
But you can see for yourself that you're in no danger, or
that there is any special urgency about the matter. You are 
not being used as a decoy. You are only helping to get a 
letter, which will be very useful to me if I can bring it to 
the right persons. I have done you a great service to-day--
not, mind you, because you have made me your friend, but 
because I am anxious about that sister of yours, whom I know,
and, most likely, I am her lover. Come, let us get this
business done, and we'll have a drink together." 
"No; not if you don't call me all the names under the sun."

"Don't be cross. I know all you want to say to me; and--
Look here, young man, let us be practical. You cannot be
ignorant of the fact that that bag has twenty pound's worth of
dust in it, the other day in this very lane? What have you
got to sell me now?"

Jasper was silent. He knew quite well that the girl had not
taken away the "dust" from the drawer. 
"Come, be honest. What have you got</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:09
