Local Life **Coney Island**

Few neighborhoods scream summertime more than Coney Island, with its squealing rides and old-school carny games. The famous Cyclone roller coaster may be out of commission since 2011, but this boardwalk was home to the very first one, back in 1927. The Coney Island branch of **Smorgasburg** (  GOOGLE MAP ) ;  %718-372-2655; www.smorgasburg.com; Coney Island Ave & W 8th St, at Stillwell Ave;  h11am-6pm Sat & Sun Jun-Oct;  bD, F, N, Q to Coney Island-Stillwell Ave) in Brooklyn has over 100 artisanal vendors selling everything from barbecue and beer to ice cream and furniture. **Sideshows** (www.coneyisland.com/sideshows.html; h10am-midnight May-Oct) features live performers on street corners and free daily shows at the famed Cyclone Theater (the world's first steel roller coaster); it's open most days, though off-season performances may only be staged in the theater.

Understand **Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill & Downtown Brooklyn**

Like its neighboring community of Manhattan, Brooklyn has evolved into one of the most densely populated places in the city. The result is a remarkable melding of old and new, where the area's history is intricately bound to its contemporary life, with old Victorian brownstones and grand Greek Revival and Renaissance mansions mingling with new luxury condos and a bustling waterfront.

### NEW YORK CITY FOR KIDS
