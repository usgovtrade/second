An IMAX screen with a 3D IMAX program allows for a new perspective to be created. There are no boundaries in the IMAX format. You can use 3D screens in your home, IMAX theatres or even IMAX theme parks. The possibilities are endless.

As a movie theatre, a mobile IMAX theatre is not much different than the theatre you've seen at home. The IMAX theater is a completely customized, permanent structure, but with a different focal point: the projector.

IMAX theatres feature the biggest screens on earth. Some have a capacity to fit several thousand people. With a new way to display the movie in an IMAX format, there is no screen limitations.

The biggest screen size isn't always the best choice for every type of movie, but it is the biggest possible projection. With the best in screen size, 3D and sound quality, you can immerse yourself in the world created for you and become part of the action. The same is true for home cinema.

With the ability to fill the room with sound and vision, IMAX is an experience everyone can enjoy.

As long as there are filmmakers, there will be a need for a way to produce bigger than life films.

A new innovation in a digital age

With over 25,000 3D screens in place, they're not going anywhere anytime soon. 3D, while expensive and energy-consuming, is an investment that can easily pay off for the right movie.

It's in the film and television industry's best interests to embrace 3D. With the best 3D technology, studios can create films that will be loved by audiences, whether they choose to view them with glasses or with their naked eyes.

In the meantime, you may never have to wear glasses again.

Whether you're in a cinema, or own your very own IMAX theatre, the new ways people will interact with entertainment and story will change the film industry forever.
