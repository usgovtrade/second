And, while it’s still a bit early to compare, I can say the northwest (N) route was busier than last year, and both the southend (S) and westend (W) routes are very busy too.

Evening temperatures range from 18 to 27°C and are expected to increase to 23-29°C this coming week. Then I think the days, with highs in the low 30s, will start to trend higher.

It’s so warm, I think I’ll be wearing flip flops tomorrow! So maybe that’s why the north end of the lake has been busy. But I’m guessing it’s the sun, too. Here’s to summer!

A couple weeks ago, while I was out in the kayak, I heard somebody coming. I didn’t look at the paddle, but when I heard the distinctive sound, I knew it was a kayak. They paddled over to the boat dock.

“Have you been enjoying the lake?” I asked.

“Oh yes, it’s great out there.”

As they got closer, I realized who they were. It was some members of the Canadian Coast Guard, from their station at Tobermory. They had come to visit our lake!

“Do you remember your first time?” I asked. “How did you start paddling? What was it like?”

And before they could answer me, they paddled back out. I still get a little thrill when I remember that first day, so many years ago, when a young lady paddled out on the lake. She never came back to kayak on Mirror Lake. I don’t know why that is. Perhaps she had a bad experience with the lake and it scared her away, and never paddled again. Or maybe she got out of the kayak and swam off the boat dock. I don’t know.

At any rate, I got to see the Canadian Coast Guard kayakers out on the lake, and that made me very happy!

Just so you know, if you need to rent a kayak on Mirror Lake in Fort William, I’m your man!

A couple weeks ago, I spent the afternoon on Mirror Lake, near the north end. And it was a beautiful day! The lake was glassy calm, the temperature was mild, and it was about 30°C, so I didn’t bother to put on a wetsuit. Instead, I left my jacket on a rock near the boat dock. And as I paddled out, I looked at the lake and realized that it was really crowded.

I had thought that paddling Mirror Lake would be relaxing. And it was. But it was also crowded.

There were lots of motorboats, kayaks, and canoes. And I mean lots. Most people seemed to be on the lake about an hour before sundown, which would put the hour around 4 PM, but I don’t know if that was when it was the busiest or if it was only my day.

I don’t really like crowds. I’d much rather be alone on the lake. There were maybe 100-200 people on Mirror Lake. It was fine, but I had to concentrate on my own paddling, as a lot of them were near me.

I did spend most of my paddle on my own, and that’s where I really appreciated Mirror Lake.

About a year ago I was reading an article in a fishing magazine that featured Mirror Lake in Fort William, BC, so I decided to take a look. At the time, it was still March and very, very cold, so I only had a couple hours to explore the lake.

The article told me that Mirror Lake was fed by the Little North Arm of Lake Superior, and it told me what I thought I knew about mirror lakes:

Mirror Lake was created when glaciers receded thousands of years ago. Layers of sand, silt, clay, and gravel deposited by glaciers remain in the lake’s bottom and banks. Thus, the lake floor, much of the middle section of Mirror Lake, and the banks are mirror-like; a calm pool at the bottom reflects the lake’s topographic shoreline.

I didn’t paddle it. Instead, I looked at it from the boat dock. And I’m glad I did. It was worth checking out for a few hours. And, when I got back home, I downloaded their podcast and listened to it while I worked at my computer.

To view more photos from the podcast visit http://www.bbc.com/travel/podcasts/mirror-lake-north-america/ There are some great photos, and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.

If you are ever in Fort William and looking for a place to paddle, I recommend Mirror Lake. It’s very calm and it’s a spectacular place to explore, by foot and by paddle. The area around Mirror Lake is a very popular camping area, and it can get busy during the summer, but right now, at this time of year, it’s a great place to relax and enjoy a quiet, glassy lake.

I love canoeing and kayaking on Mirror Lake. In fact, it’s one of my favorite things to do when I visit the area. And it’s not hard to see why. Mirror Lake is probably the most scenic of all the lakes on the Bruce Peninsula. It’s a mirror lake – a lake created by a glacier, where the water mirrors the terrain. The shoreline is a sandy bank with ripples, sand dunes, and many bays, coves and inlets.

There are also lots of animals, birds, and plants to watch, but, as I said, the main thing I love about Mirror Lake is the feeling of tranquility it brings to my mind.

There is one drawback to Mirror Lake – it can be a bit choppy and rough. I’m not sure what causes this – perhaps it’s the wind from Lake Superior to the west, which can build up into a chop when there’s a strong southwest wind. There may also be wind coming from Lake Huron to the east, and the wind direction changes as the wind changes direction. There may also be waves from fish jumping. If that’s the case, it really helps to have a paddle float, which will keep your boat stable. And if the wind is really up, it will make it a lot easier to stand up and paddle.

There are other features in Mirror Lake as well – bogs, and islands in the lake. Most of the islands are quite small, but Mirror Lake is well known for its large island, which is quite impressive.

So when I’m paddling on Mirror Lake, I don’t really focus on the scenery – it’s the feeling that I get from paddling that I really love. And, of course, I like the chance of seeing seals, turtles, fish, birds, bears, or whatever nature has to offer.
