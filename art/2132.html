The following poem is taken from S. E. Schlosberg’s book, You’re The One, and if you’re willing to be as generous and creative as my husband, take a look at this book and pass it along to someone you love.

This poem is a tribute to one of the most influential women in my life. In this day and age, it’s still surprising to see a man (and I’m quite sure that I’m not the only man who feels that way) have a soft side. I had one once, but that was a long time ago. I think that was when I first realized how much my wife had meant to me, how much she had helped me, how much she had made me whole.

Maybe you have one too? If you do, I hope that you’re able to find someone worthy of all those qualities you find so endearing.

You’re the one

I’m the one,
But I never found
The one you were.
I loved the way you
Treated others,
But somehow I missed
The time for sharing,
And I couldn’t see the difference
Between you and I.
I’ve missed you ever since,
But you’re too big
And this heart’s too small
To find a place to hold your name.
So I can only stay,
Until the day I can remember again,
Your smile and the way you smiled,
Until the day I see you again.
I’m not sure what kind of magic I have
To make the moon shine
With all its glory.
But for me, there is no such thing as goodbye,
For you’ll never be gone,
You’ll always be there.
There’s no way to hold on,
Unless there’s someone there.

That’s the way I feel about you. I’ve held onto that feeling for a long time, but I’m slowly learning to trust that feeling even more now that you’re gone. I’m more than likely to ever forget the sound of your voice, but the mere thought of you and your smile are more than enough to make this heart beat faster.

I wish that I knew what I was doing wrong. I wish that I could explain, but maybe there isn’t any reason. Maybe the way I love you was all that you ever hoped it would be, and if that’s the case, then I was exactly where I needed to be for a very long time.

I hope you know that I miss you and that I wish that there was some way for me to let you know that you haven’t gone away. I know that the feeling will eventually pass, but for now, I miss you every time you cross my mind, and every time I think of the days that we spent together.

“I’m back from my meeting
I was thinking about you and I
Knowing you’re back home, and I won’t be
Sitting in that empty room
But somehow I’ve thought of you
In spite of myself,
And I don’t understand
How it is that you got to me

I would never say
That you’re the one
I needed most
But for a while, you were
The one I needed most
I see your face, your eyes
Smiling and looking into mine
And I don’t know why, but
I’m glad that you’re here.”

To all my friends and family
Who want me to be happy and hopeful
and all that sort of thing, I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

To my friend and co-creator of all things that’s beautiful in the world, who’s no longer living,
this book is for you. I miss you dearly. You were like a sister to me.

To my friend, who has always been a little overprotective and a little unsure of herself,
but still the best thing that ever happened to me,
I don’t know if you know, but I miss you more than you will ever know.
I need a hug.

To my former co-worker, who’s friendship was never too close or too far away.
And even though I know that I have the tendency to talk about what’s going on with me too much,
you listen, and I appreciate it, even when I might be more than a little annoying.

To my wonderful wife, who takes good care of me and who knows exactly how to take care of me better than I do,
I miss you dearly. It would be easier to forget about you sometimes, but I don’t have the strength to let you go.
I don’t deserve you, but I thank you for letting me have you.

To my friend and friend of so many years, who was, and still is, someone that I can count on.
I wish I could tell you that I have everything under control, but I can’t.
I wish I could tell you that I never have anything to worry about, but it’s all in my head.
I wish I could tell you that I don’t have nightmares and anxiety attacks and other things, but there’s nothing that makes those go away.
I wish I could tell you that I don</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:01
