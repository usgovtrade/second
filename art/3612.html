The song was the B-side of their "It's So Easy" single and was released exclusively in Australia. A video was created for the song, directed by Steve Barron.

It can be found as a bonus track on Japanese editions of the album, under the title "Slither".

Reception
The single reached number 1 in the ARIA "Top 50 Singles – 1991" in Australia in June, while it spent only two weeks on the chart. The song is the first to feature Gilby Clarke, who replaced Izzy Stradlin as the band's new lead guitarist after Slash had fired him a few weeks before the Appetite for Destruction album was released. It is also the last song to feature bassist Duff McKagan and keyboardist Dizzy Reed as band members until the album "Chinese Democracy" nearly four years later.

Music video

The music video for the single features clips of the band playing in concert, being attacked by police and being chased by the police while being chased by a car, a man throwing a woman off the balcony, and the band walking in a forest. The band is performing "Out ta Get Me" and "It's So Easy". "Out ta Get Me" plays near the end of the video, and "It's So Easy" plays in the background. Dizzy Reed is absent from the video, but he is shown playing in "So Fine". Slash makes a cameo appearance in the music video for "So Fine". As "It's So Easy" plays, Gilby Clarke can be seen in the video playing rhythm guitar onstage. A performance of the song that features Stradlin on guitar, McKagan on bass, and Reed on piano is shown. However, it can be noted that only Clarke is an official member of the band when the performance occurred. All other Guns N' Roses band members (Duff McKagan, Slash, Dizzy Reed, and Steven Adler) did not join Guns until 1991, following Appetite for Destruction. The video ends with McKagan throwing a large rock at the camera and then Clarke slamming his bass to the ground. The camera then pans down and zooms in on Clarke's bass, the end of which features the band logo being smeared across it.
