It was the story of a girl who wants to go to the dance but her mother won't let her go and she just stays at home all night long. While all her friends go to the dance, she stays home and works on her homework, while she is reading The Little Engine That Could which her mother is reading in the same book. She goes to school the next day and tells the teacher about her night when she went to the ball. Later, her mother wants her to cut out some recipes out of the magazine. As she tries to cut the recipe out, she slips and cuts her finger. While her mother is tending to her finger, the girl finds the picture of the little engine who had his own troubles, and thinks that it's a story about her. Then she goes to her mother and she tells her about The Little Engine That Could. Her mother tells her that's true and that she and her father always work together. After she has listened to the story, she tells her mother that she was just trying to cut the recipe out to impress her friends with her good cooking. Her mother decides that she will let her go to the dance if she wants. At the dance, she meets David, a boy and they go on a date. Later, she learns that her mother has just gotten promoted. 

The story ends with David and Judy looking at a poster of the Little Engine.
