These are from the point of view of someone who was, and is very familiar with the subject (even if I do not have 100% accuracy with information on certain points). If I missed any notable songs that are not on this list, feel free to add them in the comments!

Best songs about death for those who have experienced it (and for those who wish they never would experience it):

A good amount of the songs that I looked into are about life after death and how the person is being prepared for it. Since the songs that I talked about were all written by a Christian perspective, I decided to not include some songs that I know about (but did not talk about) but are in a Christian category. These are songs about death and the afterlife that I had heard, but did not find great information about:

- “Heaven” by Blake Shelton- “Heaven in Your Eyes” by Keith Urban- “When The Stars Burn Out” by Avril Lavigne

These last three songs have something in common: they are all songs that talk about death and what comes after. But these aren’t the only two songs of this genre, and don’t have the most powerful messages behind them.

I also wanted to include the last song on this list which speaks of the “garden” – the place where you’ll be after you die. It doesn’t talk about death itself, but when you die you’ll be in a place of paradise, when you leave your earthly body.

“You Need to Calm Down” by Taylor Swift is a very special song for me, because I had asked God a lot about this and whether or not we need to be born again. This song was the answer I received.

When I first heard this song, it was very meaningful to me, as well as a bit emotional. It is a reminder of how God has blessed us and how he will always be with us through his Holy Spirit. He will never leave or forsake us because he knows everything we go through – even our darkest and most depressed moments. This song has a message that has stuck with me since the day I heard it, and I hope it helps you, too.

There are many other good songs out there that talk about death and what comes after, and I suggest that you listen to these ones, or some of the ones I mentioned if you have not heard them already. I hope you will be as blessed as I was when I first heard these and hopefully find an answer to your questions about this subject.

So thank you for reading this article, and I hope you enjoyed the selection of songs that I had to choose from!

I’m thankful you brought up this list. This was something that got me thinking, “when you die what happens? Are you in heaven, are you in a new place with God? What happens?” I have had so many questions about this but I’ve never been able to really come up with a satisfactory answer. I’ve been trying to research this but I feel like I’ve hit a wall. I will add these to the list, though, so that I can maybe give me some insight on what happens after death, if that’s what I want to know. 😉 Thanks again!

Glad you find these helpful! I would say this is one of the most asked questions on Earth. The belief I have about this is you are living in the shadow of death (we are all on earth for such a short time). So when you die, it’s just like you’re going back to where you were (you’re in your heavenly home). Hope this helps you. :)

Hey, I just read all the comments from previous readers. Thank you very much for putting together this blog and these helpful tips. This has been a good start for me, and has already made me a bit more aware of what I should and should not be putting into my mind to ease my concerns over death. As well as a nice place to find some inspiration when I’m feeling the weight of my own existence. Thank you.

Thank you for visiting. I hope you enjoy these songs that I’ve put in a playlist. You can find it on Spotify if you wish to listen to it on Spotify instead of YouTube. Also, I wanted to let you know that the link is going to be in a video on the site which will be starting soon! This should keep you updated with things here on the blog, as well as my other projects and other things going on in my life. I’m sorry to say that I do not currently have any shows for the blog, but if you have any ideas, suggestions, or questions, please do leave them in the comments and I will look into them.

I just added this link to my own page here, because I thought it was a nice and kind addition to the “About” page that I have now created. You can also find a link there to an album of mine that I put together about a couple of years ago.

Thank you so much, I have found some really great songs on your list here! I would love if you checked out a few of the songs I’ve shared in this group of tracks, I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed putting them together:

I’ve got some songs that I didn’t put on my blog, I am sorry about that, but I love all of them and it would mean a lot if you were to listen to them as well and share some of your favorite songs with me.

Hi, I just started following this page and I’m so glad I did! I am just in the middle of a lot of things in my life and it’s good to learn more about death, to have something to add to my list. This has just made my day. Thanks!

The song “In Christ Alone” is by Michael W. Smith, and it was the song that I heard the first time that I really felt the strong presence of the Holy Spirit. I just thought that it would be a good one to share. 🙂</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 09:55:50
