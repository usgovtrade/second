Instead 
of sending money to my family I had 
to keep it. 
A year later, I have 
no relatives 
I have nothing, 
And what happens? 
I get on a boat, 
I go to France, 
And I start to work, 
To bring the money that 
is going to be 
I’m going to come out of here. 
No, I don’t know, why can't we 
work? 
A year later I get a permit,
I get a temporary permit, 
And I go, it’s a day or two, 
that's 
It’s almost 
The last day. 
Then I think, well, what 
should I do, you know, 
And, and I was thinking about it, 
and I was thinking, 
I can start working in my own town, 
A house in the countryside, 
And it doesn't take much to build. 
It’s really cheap, it’s 
And that's a dream for me, 
to work and to stay at home, 
I can work in a town and stay there. 
And then everything 
I start to call 
all the farmers around here, 
and I explain it to them. 
And I’ll be there 
in 10 months,
I get my permit, 
and I’ll be on that date, 
and I’ll go to work 
I get to work, and I think, 
What do I have? I have a house. 
I have a truck, I have some 
I have almost nothing, I have 
my house, and I have 
a month of food, 
that's it, 
I’m going to have 
my stuff, 
I think, OK, 
And that's how I start. 
And when I have those people 
the first few months of the year, 
It was great because I 
have my house, 
you 
that's really 
a dream. 
And I was working, I don’t 
know, I was working like 10 
hours a day. 
And then my life is going really well, 
I had more money in my pocket, 
And then one day I had 
to do a check-in at the police 
station, and they check 
And then I have 
a warning, you 
have no permit. 
And they send me to the police 
police, and they sent me to 
and I have a warning 
then my car is taken, 
and I have 
a suspension, 
And then I go to the police, 
and they are told that 
I am no longer going to have a permit, 
I have my house, 
but that was 
the thing that worried me. 
I had to 
I don’t know.
At the police, 
that’s how 
And my little house 
is my shelter, 
and I was 
I’m going to work, and I’m going to 
keep it. 
That’s it. 
So I didn’t have any other choice 
but to leave everything 
and start everything from scratch.
The things are 
is that I had to 
start all over 
So the things are going really well, 
very well. 
I always have good work, I have 
I’m going to send money to my family, 
I'm going to see 
them often, 
And that’s 
life's been very 
bad. 
I went to see a doctor, 
I had to do another 
I had a stroke in February. 
I've had two different things 
I've had a stroke, 
and I had my 
blood pressure checked, 
it was 140 
millimeters in my blood pressure, 
And then it went down to 120, 
120, 
so 
120, and it was OK, 
and then it started going back up, 
and it was going back up again, 
so I’m going to have a new doctor, 
then everything goes down again, 
is a small stroke, I didn't 
And it came back up to 120, 
it went down to 
This is the second one. 
And my work 
is 
That's 
bad 
That’s how 
that’s it. 
So I went to see 
another doctor, 
And they send me to see a 
and then the next day I have this:
I 
didn't have a doctor. 
So I went to a hospital, 
and I had to go 
I don't have 
There’s 
nothing there, 
I don't know, because I’ve been working, 
I've been working, I've been working, 
I have nothing, 
I have nothing, 
this is 
So I go see my doctor, 
and we do a test and they say, 
And then he goes to see me. 
He says, I want to do this test, 
it will take one or two weeks, 
it's going to be OK. 
And then when 
a week later, I'm going to go there, 
and then he 
calls me and he says, 
If I have 
another 
So I was here, 
I was here, I don't know, 
I’m going to 
get in 
a hurry, I 
don't have a life. 
So I’m going to go to the doctor 
of course, the 
but we did a test, 
We didn't 
I’ve 
had these problems, I haven’t 
a little problem, 
with the blood pressure, 
And then he says, I’m not coming 
me, 
I’m not coming there, I don’t know 
to another hospital 
where 
there, 
and that's how 
I go to him 
he did 
all this. 
And then he tells me that, 
you can not work, you can’t work. 
I have no choice, I 
have no choice, I don’t 
I can't look for a job, 
I can't go to the hospital. 
I don't have the time. 
And then he says, 
it’s 
if 
you go to 
I want to send you to 
you go to the hospital, it's better, 
don’t go there. 
That's how he told me, 
but then he said, 
There’s one thing I’m not going to do. 
There’s one thing 
you have to 
I’m going to work with you, 
I’m going to work with you. 
And he 
It will be my life, 
but 
we went there 
he didn’t want to do it. 
It’s 
And 
So 
doctors 
he 
So 
I’ve had 
I go there, we get into the car, 
and we’re going 
the doctor 
I don’t 
the house, 
And 
the doctor, 
he said 
my life, 
He said, 
I know 
It doesn't matter, 
and 
And I said, 
But I don’t care. 
I can’t do anything. 
I have 
it, and I can't do anything 
I’m going 
It 
He says, 
You know what? 
You need to go to another doctor, 
and that's what 
to another doctor, 
and 
he wants to put me to the hospital, 
and there is not much he can do 
me. 
I don’t know, I can’t do anything, 
And then they 
the 
doctor’s office 
So 
everything is 
go to the other doctor, 
So I did it, 
and I 
then 
I said,

but she was right
