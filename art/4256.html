This is guide to adding Google Analytics tracking code to your WordPress site. The code that we are going to add comes with a custom variable that is essential to the functionality of your WordPress site, therefore you will need to add the analytics code to your web site.

Why We Need to Add Custom Variables to Your Site:

Google Analytics makes use of custom variables to perform various functions. For example, you can set a custom variable with “ga:userCountry” to determine which country your audience is from. And if you are selling different products or services, then you should have a different custom variable for each.

To know the exact details about this, take a look at the code in Google Analytics’ tracking code where you will find things such as the following:

This is how we need to change things if you want to be able to know where people are coming from, and more importantly you will be able to determine which products they’re interested in.

You can check the code in the image below:

How to Add Custom Variables to WordPress Site

Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account

If you do not have a Google Analytics account, then you need to create one.

If you are a WordPress user, you need to login to Google Analytics to create the account.

Or you can create the account manually by signing up for Google Analytics here.

As the final step, you should create a Google Analytics account for your site. To do this, login to your Google Analytics account, and click on Admin in the top right corner of the screen.

Step 2: Connect to Your Google Analytics Account

To set up the custom variable, you need to make sure that your site is linked to your account. So once you are logged in to your Google Analytics account, make sure that you also have the option to select ‘My Profile’ under the Admin screen.

Step 3: Upload the Tracking Code

Once you have set up the Google Analytics account, it’s time to move on to creating your own tracking code. To do this, click on the menu link on your left, and then click on Admin in the top right corner. Now select the Property of your choice.

Afterward, click on the Admin link once more to edit the property. It’s now time to download the code and then paste it into your site.

To do this, log into your Google Analytics account and select the Profile of your choice. After that, click the Admin link in the top right corner, and then click ‘View report’, and then click ‘Download CSV’.

Now you need to add the tracking code to your site. So you need to create a page on your WordPress site. Select Insert into Post or page, and enter the code below into the HTML editor.

Afterwards, make sure that you save the file and then publish the changes by clicking on the ‘Publish’ button at the top of the screen.

Wow!! That is an amazing article!!! I tried to add your code on my wordpress site and it is not working. The page is just blank. This is a common question in my WordPress forums as well and I was glad to see you made it so easy and step-by-step. Thank you so much!

What if you have already added some custom variables in your code? What would you do in that case? Would you add a new code to track again or add manually? How would you do that? And how do you even know where your Custom variable was added and its name? Thank you.

I hope you already had a look at the post. Basically, if you have added variables already, you need to update your code with the new information. Once that is done, you should add your tracking code by clicking on the ‘Admin’ tab on the Google Analytics account page and then selecting ‘Tracking Info’ option, enter the tracking code in the “Get code” field and that’s it!

Can you check if you have a custom var called “honeypot” – it looks like it should have only one, but it sometimes has multiple.

Thanks for the code. It’s really an amazing work. I tried it out on the site. The error says ‘The following variables are missing in this data: pageview (ga:pageview)’. This is what I was facing a few days ago and I got it resolved by trying one of the earlier comments on this post. Thanks for all the new insights, I’m sure I’ll be able to solve all my issues now. Thanks again, really appreciate it. Cheers !

I am trying to show this info in a wordpress site. In google analytic it is showing me zero data.
Should i need to set anything in my code. My google analytics account is already logged in. I have followed the steps step by step and still getting the same data.

I found the code for adding the custom variables to be quite confusing, so I found this post, which seems to have the code a lot easier to follow. I was able to add my custom variables to the code, but now I am getting this error:

There was a problem saving your settings. Please try again.

Any idea why I might be getting this error? Is there anything wrong with the code I have? Thanks for the amazing article. I always struggled with this before, now it’s easy!

Thank you so much for sharing this great piece of information. I was looking for a plugin that would help me to set a Google Analytics tracking code. It is an extremely easy plugin to do and gives you the option to add a specific tracking code or the default code. It is perfect for those who want a quick Google Analytics set up on your website, or maybe just for testing purposes. I hope you will write more about this in the future.

Thank you for taking your time to go through all of the steps needed to set up a Google Analytics account. My husband and I want to see if we can help out people with the process of learning how to create a website by setting up our own sites. Can you help us with the steps to setting up a website using the steps you listed in your blog? Would really appreciate the help.

If you need help, you can try this resource, which is a step by step guide to setting up a new website: www.wikihow.com/Create-a-WordPress-Blog – It’s basically written by someone who has actually done the work.

Thanks for this amazing post. It actually helped me a lot. This is why it is so important to have a blog for your work.

Thanks again!
