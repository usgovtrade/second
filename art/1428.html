This will be my third year of the event, so I’m very much looking forward to seeing you all. Looking back, what can I say? A fantastic bunch of guys and gals.

You have given me time and energy. Some of you I have known for many years.

This year the ‘coffee hour’ will be taking place in the ‘Hive’, which is very comfortable. So we’d love to see everyone dressed in a t-shirt, jeans and trainers for this lovely outdoor session (it’s a little bit nippy outside). Please do not come to the event in a formal shirt or jacket and smart trousers – you won’t fit in!

This year there will be no ‘posters’, but we do have a great selection of artwork in store for anyone interested in buying any of the originals. Please do remember to bring along an empty rucksack (approximately 20–40 litres), as this will be needed for transporting the artwork home. The rucksack will be a good option for you to also show off your new artwork.
