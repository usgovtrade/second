# PREFACE

"It's a great story, Mr. Murphy, but it's not true."

"Are you sure?" I asked. "Because I've got it all written down in a book..."

I was about to show some guy sitting at a table in a coffeehouse a leather-bound volume about ancient Egypt, but I noticed that he was eyeing me suspiciously and holding his coffee with both hands like a weapon. Suddenly the cup flew across the table, shattered in front of us, and spilled hot coffee down his coat.

"You son of a bitch!" he said, his eyes as wide as saucers. "How dare you tell this story about me in public!"

"Let's be reasonable," I said. "You've got no reason to be angry with me. There's a certain code of conduct in our business, and I'm sure you know it."

"I don't know what you're talking about," he said, trying not to cry as he gathered up his soaked coat and a few papers from the table. "I'm a respected lawyer. I'd never make up a story like that. This has got to be a mistake. All I can tell you is that you better be careful about what you say because you never know when some crazy bastard is going to take offense and call in the law. You might get hurt."

"Calm down, sir," I said. "I'm going to go now, and we'll forget this ever happened."

"I'm telling you, you never should have told that story. Now I'll have to go to my lawyer."

"Are you threatening me?"

"Don't play games with me. Don't play dumb."

"Are you threatening me?" I repeated. "You just don't do that. Not to me. I run a magazine here in New York called _Esoteric_ , and if you start talking like that, I'll tell everyone. I'll call your family. You want that, asshole?"

He seemed confused. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said. "I'm not threatening you."

"We'll see," I said. "But let me tell you something. No one knows more about ghosts than I do."

"I don't know what you're talking about."
