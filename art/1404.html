The album title references an episode of The Twilight Zone, "A Small Talent for War," which featured a protagonist in a wheelchair (portrayed by Richard Basehart) with the ability to transcend death and, along with the protagonist's friends, prevent World War III from starting. The album's single, "Never Say Die," contains the same quote that was used in the episode, and the track also heavily samples the movie.

The album was recorded on a low budget in a studio near the band's hometown of Hamilton, Ontario, with producer Dave Genn (Rush, Hush, I Mother Earth).
