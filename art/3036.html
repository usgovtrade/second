The words and video were a product of the "Driving Under the Influence: Don't Be Blinded by the Headlights" program which addresses the issue of driving with blood alcohol levels that exceed the legal limit of .08 (some states lower the limit even lower) and the damage that can be caused by driving with impaired judgment. The DUI program focuses on the three Ps of driving, perspective, and people.

The three Ps of driving are the physical and chemical processes that enable us to move, the perils that threaten us as humans, and the people who populate our roads. This program offers insight on the physical and chemical processes of driving and driving under the influence. It is imperative to understand how a person's actions can harm others as well as themselves, or risk losing a life because of someone else's poor choices.

A portion of the video follows, in which the main character is experiencing a panic attack after consuming alcohol. "Don't be Blinded by the Headlights" addresses the three Ps of driving, perspective, and people. What is presented is a message that is not a heavy handed judgment on the human condition. Instead the program allows the human condition to speak for itself. "Don't be Blinded by the Headlights" speaks from the point of view of a person who has been through a nightmare and uses the power of storytelling to bring meaning to their situation. The video is meant to illustrate the story and not push the viewer to act against or for the drunk driver.

"Don't be Blinded by the Headlights" speaks on three Ps:

  * Perspective – It is your responsibility to know the risks of driving when you're drunk. It's even more important for your friends and family to understand that you're not in control when you've been drinking. By being honest with your friends and family, you help ensure everyone else's safety.
  * People – Whether you have one drink or many, think about the people around you. Your actions can have repercussions for all of you.
  * Process – Whether you have a couple drinks or are drunk, try to learn from the experience and use it as a way to become a better person.

Dr. Torey Lampman, president of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), was quoted saying of the program: "I was impressed with the personalization of this program," "If we can get the message through, that there are consequences to drinking and driving, we might save some lives."
