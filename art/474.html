calibrate the energy meters at the EOTT meter-read stations.  The meters, 
located at EOTT's natural gas wells, are designed to be read manually 
throughout the year.  However, these manual meter reads have been sporadic, 
reducing the effectiveness of EOTT's natural gas revenue information.  

EOTT receives a bill for natural gas delivered to its producers, but it does 
not know the amount of gas metered to its specific wells.  The meter-read 
stations are equipped with a gas meter attached to a local data-logger that 
electronically records data about gas metered by the EOTT meter.  Based on 
the flow rates recorded by this data logger, EOTT is able to "build out" its 
natural gas billing.  (This process is more accurate than attempting to 
convert "wellhead" data into "flow" data, a process which only estimates 
meters without actually recording and verifying the volumes.)  The meter-read 
stations are installed to reduce both the costs of manual readings as well as 
the potential for human error. 

The old method of measuring gas for billing purposes at EOTT meter-read 
stations began in the field. This required the meter-read station technician 
to record the quantity of gas pumped from each meter, using a "dummy" gas 
meter. One meter was permanently affixed to the ground near the gas meter, 
while the other was left on the gas meter to record gas volume. One meter 
volume was connected to the inlet and outlet valves on the meter-read station 
while the other was linked to the flow meter. When the flow meter was read 
(through the electronic logger) it was noted whether gas was entering the 
station, leaving the station, or simply was not measured at all. Once meter 
volume and meter flow were linked, the meter-read station technician could 
subtract meter volume from meter flow to determine the volume of gas consumed 
at each meter location. This process was repeated for all meter-read 
stations. 

To accurately determine the volume of gas being measured by the meter-read 
stations, the technician must read the flow meter within a reasonable 
interval (for example, 30 days) of metering the gas. This ensures that the 
read of the flow meter is reflective of the volume of gas being used. The 
process of taking the "dummy" gas meter reading may be as simple as walking 
to the meter-read station, visually comparing the new and old gas meter 
readings, and making an estimate of how much gas was pumped through the meter 
during that time period. However, the meters may be located on different 
buildings or in different counties and are not always read within this 
reasonable interval. As a result, the volume of gas used may vary by more 
than ten percent from month to month. 

This new method involves creating a virtual or computer meter. This virtual 
meter will use mathematical modeling to determine the volume of gas used by 
an individual meter, by integrating the meter flow data that is recorded at 
the station during the time the gas meter was in use. When this new 
technique is used, and when it is necessary to add or delete meters, the 
computer meter simply requires the updated meter-read data (e.g., meter 
volumes and meter flows) to be reprocessed so that the output data are now 
reflective of the current usage by the meters. 

The above-described method uses only a small portion of the meter-read data, 
providing an extremely accurate determination of the volume of gas used by 
EOTT's natural gas wells.  Our intent in taking this new method to develop a 
more accurate volume determination is to improve EOTT's billing efficiency 
and to eliminate the irregularities often created by manual meter reads.

Because of the nature of EOTT's gas contracts, it is the intent of the 
business unit controllers to make this change as quickly as possible. 
Therefore, EOTT is looking to take this new method out into the field by 
September 30th. This will allow the business unit controllers to meet the 
goals set by the accounting and operations department. The EOTT meter-read 
stations will remain in the field for many years to come. In order for 
EOTT's natural gas revenue information to remain as accurate as possible, we 
must work with the existing technology that is in place. 

Once this method is installed and tested in the field, we will work with the 
accounting and operations department to verify that this method is producing 
valuable and reliable data. We will also request their assistance in 
replicating this method throughout the country.

The EOTT meter-read stations have the following benefits: 
? Allows daily meter reads to be taken on a daily basis 
? Provides access to detailed daily records 
? Allows EOTT to use as many locations as are necessary (not limited by 
distance from a control center) 
? Requires no technical expertise in the field (can be read by personnel 
with only limited training) 
? Eliminates the need to check for gas at each meter-read station to ensure 
the meter is recording accurately

your continued support.
