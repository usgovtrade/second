While the majority of the castaways will be familiar with immunity idols from the original series, The Amazon was the only season to feature the second version of the immunity idol (also referred to as an “extinction idol”).

In this week’s preview episode, a new version of an immunity idol called an “immunity necklace” can be found in a special hiding place at camp. The necklace, however, is not found on any island resident until the twelfth episode. At that point, the necklace was worn by two castaways, and one of the two won the reward challenge. If you wear the necklace at the Immunity Challenge, it will guarantee that you survive that round, but you will also not receive a reward or see yourself advance in the game. While it may sound complicated, the Immunity Challenge usually comes down to who is best at socializing and lying to their fellow castaways to win that round. Because they can lie or change their minds, the necklace actually works like a free pass for the remaining two days of the game. Once an immunity necklace has been claimed, it can be used by the same castaway in future challenges, but not by another.

That also means that an immunity necklace is a great bargaining chip for any tribe that has more than two players. If another tribe wins immunity, they can give an immunity necklace to a tribe member that has an idol. It’s a trade because it gives them the idol, and it keeps them in the game. For instance, if a tribe wins immunity and doesn’t have an immunity idol, they can offer the necklace in exchange for one. If they can’t produce one, they may try to fake it, as Kellee Kim from Survivor: Philippines did in 2015. She hid the idol in her bra and pretended to find it at the Immunity Challenge, which allowed her tribe to swap her and a previous winner for a new player and a hidden immunity idol.

The Second Immunity Idol

In Season 35, there were not enough individual immunity idols hidden around camp for every tribe member, so CBS introduced a brand new rule: if more than two players win individual immunity, the non-immune will have to give the Immunity Necklace to someone who wins individual immunity. There is also no requirement to give back that necklace in the future, meaning that some players can try to use their idols strategically to swap out their ally for an opposing tribe member who is most likely safe. The necklace itself has a very low chance of being found when not used in an Immunity Challenge, so there’s no need to worry about it being swapped out after someone finds it.

Hidden Immunity Idol vs. Hidden Immunity Idol

The Hidden Immunity Idol is an idol made to look like a fake immunity idol, so it has a much different use than the regular version of the idols. The Hidden Immunity Idol doesn’t grant immunity at any stage of the game, so it’s used for social purposes, but the idol works the same way as the original. If you find the Hidden Immunity Idol and you can’t keep it, you must give it to someone who wins individual immunity, and they will be allowed to keep it and use it to save themselves.

Hidden Immunity Idol vs. Immunity Necklace

While the Hidden Immunity Idol and Immunity Necklace serve the same purpose (winning immunity for someone else), they have very different uses.

The Hidden Immunity Idol is an advantage to the player who finds it and can be used to save someone in the individual immunity challenge. The Immunity Necklace is an advantage to the person who finds it, but it can only be used in the future if more than two players have won individual immunity.

Hidden Immunity Idol vs. Hiding Immunity Idol

Unlike the Hidden Immunity Idol, the original version of the Immunity Idol does not require you to give it to another player when you win individual immunity.

While the Immunity Idol is one of the more famous hidden items, players have taken advantage of other items as well. These items are meant to be secrets that are not allowed to be seen on camera, which can be used for all sorts of different purposes. Some of them, like the “I Gotta Believe” necklace, allow a castaway to use it as if it’s an idol in an individual immunity challenge. Other items, like the Immunity Necklace, can only be used in the future.

While they might not be as well known as the Immunity Idol, other hidden items from the past Survivor seasons have helped castaways make it to the end of the game.

The Immunity Map

In Season 11, the most notorious and dangerous castaway to ever play Survivor was the season’s winner, Parvati Shallow. Her dominance became so bad that the eventual victor was a woman she herself had voted off earlier in the game.

To survive, Parvati used a power of immunity that came directly from her relationship with the producers: Her Immunity Map. In episode two of the season, Parvati and several other players were shown clues from “hidden cards” sent by producers, which were intended to help their relationship. During the game, Parvati had to find the exact locations of four idols. Once she did so, she had to mark them on the map, and then that information would be relayed to the producers and used to change the course of the game.

When the castaways voted her out, Parvati was very disappointed, so she wrote a letter to her fellow Survivors to express her feelings about her ousting. She pointed out that she was voted out due to alliance votes and not because she had an Immunity Idol that allowed her to vote out her ally Shane, which was a fact everyone knew about.

Parvati sent a copy of the Immunity Map to her fellow contestants before she left the game, so it was a common knowledge on the season.

It was later used in Season 20, when Russell Hantz, who won the reward challenge that week, voted out an alliance mate by using the map. Once Russell got the Immunity Map, he discovered that one of his targets was a secret alliance member who had no immunity, so he put the map to good use.

The Hidden Immunity Idol vs. Parvati’s Immunity Map

Since Parvati sent a copy of the Immunity Map to the contestants, the Hidden Immunity Idol is not as useful as Parvati’s original plan.

The Hidden Immunity Idol allows the person who finds it to win individual immunity, which is a much simpler process. There’s no need to track down the right people to talk to, and it requires little work on your part. However, if you can use the Immunity Map to find the idols and save yourself, that is a much more significant advantage.

The Hidden Immunity Idol can be found throughout the season and can be used by anyone who finds it. The Immunity Map was only found by a select few castaways, so it had more importance to Parvati because she had to fight for it with others. The Hidden Immunity Idol is hidden among the other items around camp, so anyone who can find it can use it to save themselves, so long as they win individual immunity.

Hidden Immunity Idol vs. Immunity Necklace

While the Immunity Map is a valuable hidden item for finding idols, it can only be used once for immunity. The Hidden Immunity Idol can be used as many times as necessary by keeping it and giving it to someone else when they win individual immunity. However, the Immunity Necklace is more permanent than the Hidden Immunity Idol, since it can only be used once, and only applies to the next time you win individual immunity.

In this sense, the Immunity Necklace is more useful for getting people to switch sides than the Hidden Immunity Idol, because the Hidden Immunity Idol isn’t hidden anywhere where the opposing tribe can see it, so it can only be used once, whereas the Immunity Necklace can be used as many times as needed.

Hidden Immunity Idol vs. Power of Veto

The Immunity Idol and Power of Veto (POV) are the most recognizable and permanent of the three, since each can only be used once. However, both can be used for many different purposes, so it’s hard to label them as “good” or “bad” without looking at their context.

The Hidden Immunity Idol is an advantage to the player who finds it. This benefit comes from the fact that it grants immunity at the Immunity Challenge. In Survivor, individual immunity is incredibly valuable because if you’re the sole remaining castaway, you’ll win the next Reward or Immunity Challenge. In this case, the Hidden Immunity Idol is more useful than the Power of Veto, which can be used any time in any order to get a teammate to your side for the final tribal council.
