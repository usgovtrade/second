The album was recorded in Hollywood, with the same four musicians as on their previous album, plus a fifth – pianist Kenny Rogers – who came in when the group ran out of songs. "That was tough for us," said producer Steve Gaines. "Kenny Rogers had to learn the songs, and sometimes we couldn't get a good sound until the second take, because it was just rough in that first pass."  It peaked at #8 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart.  Two singles were released, "You Can't Stop Me" b/w "He Likes You" and "The Good Life" b/w "It's Too Late". Both singles failed to reach the Billboard top 40. "Drowning" is a cover version of a song by The Hollies that also appears on the album.
