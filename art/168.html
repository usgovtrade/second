(1) Assignment or Grant of Options Agreement

A few comments:

The tax language in my previous e-mail was not an accurate representation.
The correct state to tax is Colorado, not Washington.
I added language to  "Tax Representations"  with the caveat that once a tax 
opinion has been obtained, we are free to use the assigned name and logo for 
our company.
We will give a 5% discount off of the first year's fee (as indicated in the 
previous e-mail) in order to try and motivate the client a bit.

Please see details below:


(i)   The Assignment or Grant will be effective as of the earlier of (a) 
September 1, 2000 or (b) the date of signing of this Agreement, and will 
continue until terminated as provided herein.

(ii)  Optionee may exercise the Option at any time between the effective date 
and September 1, 2000.  Optionee must, however, give Shareholder notice of 
its intent to exercise the Option not less than 30 days prior to the 
September 1, 2000 effective date.  If Optionee does not give notice to 
Shareholder as provided for herein, then the Option will automatically expire 
as of September 1, 2000.

(iii)  Optionee shall pay to the applicable clearinghouse, which is 
identified as follows, the additional fees and taxes described below:

Clearinghouse:  One West Corporate Center, Suite 3200, Denver CO 80202
Fee:            $10,000 per appointment
Taxes:  Colorado Taxes (6.60% of total value, no more than $10 million)

(iv) Optionee shall have no further obligations with respect to the Option 
and the Option (together with all rights associated therewith) shall 
terminate.


(2) Assignment and Assumption Agreement

We have not yet reviewed this document, but have been asked to review it for 
the purpose of providing collateral support for an omnibus confirmation 
already in place between our client and ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments with respect to this 
Assignment and Assumption Agreement.

Regards,
Everett

With respect to the legal terms of the assignment:

I will have to give notice to John Suttle.  I should be able to finalize the 
agreement tomorrow and fax it to you before noon.

What is the source of your funding of the option price?

I'd like to begin negotiating the terms of the ISDA as soon as possible so 
that I can get the ISDA and confirm out to the counterparty as soon as 
possible.  How can we get the docs to the counterparty as soon as possible?

Thanks,
John

Fyi.  Liquids/global liquids.  Would these groups want to see the legal risk 
memo?  I don't know how much or if anything we should send to them.
