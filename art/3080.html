The prayer we want to answer is: "God, help my child be a prayer warrior!"

Now imagine having a book filled with 50 ideas for creative, age-appropriate Bible studies and group games for your family or kids group. No two pages are the same. That's what you'll have in our new book, How to Pray with Kids at the Same Time. It's a fun book designed to encourage kids to start praying in small groups and large group settings.

We'll also give you several other creative ideas for group work including teamwork, cooperation, team sports, and friendship. We've found kids are drawn to create and work in groups because it makes them feel like part of a family. It's more fun and meaningful than just doing something by yourself.

As a parent of four children, three of whom were in school with me, I'm personally very concerned about how to help them have a relationship with Jesus at a young age. My prayer is that every young person will have a prayer life as vibrant as those of Moses, David, and Peter.

There are hundreds of ways kids can learn more about prayer in the Bible. And when we do a Bible study together, the emphasis should not be on your children's grade but on their personal relationship with Jesus. The important thing is to have them excited about praying. They will learn to pray for themselves better if you pray with them and you should never stop!

I have personally seen the power of prayer in my own life and I know it has the power to change lives.

About The Book

How To Pray With Kids At The Same Time is written by Christian parenting expert Lori Heffner, president of Lori and Friends, Inc., and is available in Kindle and paperback.

Prayer has always been the most potent spiritual weapon in my Christian toolkit. I pray for big things, little things, family things, personal things. There's nothing that breaks my heart more than the thought of a hungry child. It's as if I'm at war, and I only have my own family and friends as allies. It's a losing battle, because our children can't run the family in our absence.

The question is, will they pray for me, or are they praying for themselves? It's all about prayer. It's personal, personal, personal.

In How To Pray With Kids at the Same Time, you'll find some fifty ideas for fun, age-appropriate prayer topics and crafts. I wanted to equip parents with ways to pray for their kids that are personal, specific, and fun.

This is the first book I've written in several years, but I believe it is very much needed. It's not a Bible study; it's more like a Bible handbook of ideas. Each idea is meant to get kids to talk about God, how they feel, and what they need.

Prayer is often given as a generic answer to prayer requests in books or sermons. But, prayer should be more of a conversation, a deep conversation, about our relationship with God. It should be personal and specific. Parents, teachers, and youth workers are called to help kids and their families connect with God on a daily basis.

I hope the book is useful for you. If there is something you want to cover that I haven't covered, let me know and I'll see what I can do!

Lori Heffner

Lori is a wife and mother, a corporate educator, and a writer. The daughter of missionaries, she grew up in East Africa, Central America, and South America. She and her husband have four children and have served as missionaries in Africa, Thailand, and the United States. She loves to sing with her children in their church choir, and also loves to read and write.

Her vision to release this book came from listening to parents lament the need for ways to connect with children. She has had the opportunity to talk to teens, parents, and youth workers alike, and through those conversations she knew there was a desperate need for a small, practical, personalized, comprehensive book of Bible ideas for children.

Lori was raised by a loving mother who was a single parent. Her love of books came from that example and has helped to shape the way she wants to raise her kids. She also believes it is vital for moms to have someone they trust to talk to in times of prayer and anxiety. Her husband, who is a physician, is a wonderful confidant who helps her sort through the confusion of motherhood. She loves to work with kids, whether in her business or with her home group. She also enjoys spending time with friends and helping with her community group in her village church.

Lori and her family live in West Hartford, Connecticut, but they have lived in seven other countries. They have lived in Africa, Thailand, Guatemala, Thailand, Haiti, Korea, and South America.

“Prayer for my daughter”

I just wanted to share my testimony,
I have had several Christian Children’s books in my home and I have noticed a lot of difference in my son since using this book.
He is six and in 3rd grade and sometimes he can be so busy he does not have time to pray. But this book has encouraged him to pray and also how I pray for him. I gave him one “ask God” book and he loved it. When I saw this one I knew it would also be a winner!
It teaches him to pray for all of our needs and also how we can pray and have faith in God to help us.
I appreciate how you also tell him to ask God for everything, no matter what. You always let him be the one that prays and talks to God, which shows me how God wanted it to be.
If you have children in your home I am sure they would love this book and be amazed by God.
I loved it and I know God will bless you!
Yours,
Tiffany B.

“I highly recommend”

I have been using this resource with my daughter for about 1 year now. This resource is fun and exciting and very age-appropriate. I’m a mother of five and I had to keep looking for resources that catered to the different ages of my kids. So glad this resource was put together so beautifully! Highly recommend!

“My favorite book.”

This is an awesome book that teaches children how to pray. My 5 year old grandson and I used this book for a day at home with the activities. He loved it and we did not run out of material. Great book for any age of children. Very cool and well put together.

“Love the book”

This is the first book I have gotten by Lori. She put all the materials together in a way that is easy to follow and put together. My kids have never been ones to sit down and read. This book helps encourage my children to get on their knees and spend some time with God. I don’t know what my life would be like without this book!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:05:09
