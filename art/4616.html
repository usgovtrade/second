The lawsuit, filed in Dade County Circuit Court on Monday, accuses the NFL of violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty.

"Defendants' actions have cost Plaintiffs dearly and caused Plaintiffs irreparable harm and injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law," according to the lawsuit.

When reached for comment, a Patriots spokesperson said the organization had no comment.

Fans claim that New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's company, Kraft Sports Group, "sells and distributes tickets using stolen credit card information."

Those who tried to purchase tickets were directed to a website set up by the Patriots, kstg.sportickets.com, that allowed them to enter the credit card information used to make the original purchase. The fans say they were then directed to Kraft's website, where they bought tickets that they were not authorized to do.

"It is against public policy for a ticket service provider to obtain and distribute tickets on behalf of its ticket purchaser without obtaining that purchaser's informed consent and without the issuance of a valid ticket to that person," the lawsuit states. "Defendants violate this rule when they sell and distribute tickets that are being illegally and fraudulently obtained."

Kraft has been charged with two counts of misdemeanor solicitation.

Other lawsuits have been filed against the Patriots.

Four former New England Patriots employees sued the organization for wage theft and sexual harassment, claiming the team provided a "toxic environment" in which allegations of harassment, abuse, and discrimination would not be properly addressed.

They were also named in a 2015 lawsuit against Kraft, Belichick and Brady, alleging the team used electronic surveillance to steal the opposing team's game plans.

The NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell have also been named in a class-action lawsuit for $5 billion over a concussion lawsuit.
