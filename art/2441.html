The season is part of the inaugural year of programming for a season that will last until December. The concert season includes performances by internationally renowned musicians and is headlined by a new production of Handel’s oratorio, Israel in Egypt.

The Barnett has been a long time coming for the City of New Haven, which is located right in the center of the musical map of America. It is a cultural center with a commitment to classical music for everyone. And it’s right here, in this city, that the world-famous American orchestras of the world first performed. If you have never been to New Haven, you can catch a world-class concert and then find your way to dinner or a drink afterwards. If you are looking to take advantage of a rare treat for musical experiences that transcend what you have experienced before, you should go. Check out the calendar for upcoming events.
