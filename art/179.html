you are suffering from a stroke.
Also, when you dance, 
don't look as if you are in pain.
Keep it like this.
Look this way, 
like the flower has flowers and smells.
I have two important things to say to you.
First of all, 
in this scene,
you are only a guest.
The audience only knows 
a guest's identity,
but the person 
on the other side of the stage
does not know your identity.
Even if I give you a name tag, 
it will go to the audience.
Don't think that 
it is better to take a name tag.
Also, 
I need a name tag for everyone.
Then, 
what do I call everyone?
The characters are named after actors.
I think one of them is called 
"Kim Young Bin" right?
(Laughs)
The actors who 
made the films the characters are from,
will be here 
during the performances.
We can introduce 
the characters to you.
So, you should not worry, 
but act like the guests are 
in front of you.
Please understand 
the scene is only a simple roleplay.
I need to see 
where the guests are watching.
Even if you are just 
looking at your phone, 
if you can see the guests, 
I will be grateful.
Are you ready?
Ok. I'm going to teach you now.
Please take care of yourself.
Are you ready?
"I'm scared."
He is so cute.
"Oh!"
Wait a second.
"What are you doing?"
"You scared me!"
(Nervous)
"You really scared me."
"You scared me!"
"Please give me some water."
Why are you being so strange?
Give me some water.
My mouth is drying up.
Why are you doing this?
Are you just here to laugh?
Come over here.
Take my hand.
This hand. 
You scared me!
What's the matter?
You guys really didn't take care of your friend.
Hey, 
what are you doing over there?
Don't run. 
Come and see what's going on.
Hey, please show me your hands.
Is this our guest? 
She can only use this kind of voice 
for this performance.
(Talking in her own voice)
What? Oh my...
Your friend and colleagues 
just threw your coat like that?
What should I do?
Don't do that. 
We are here now.
I will throw it away. 
Oh no!
You can't do that.
You should throw it over there.
Why can't you throw it over there? 
(Sobs)
(Laughs)
You should treat 
my friend well from now on.
What is this?
This is our guest, right?
(Reacts)
What is this? 
How can you just do this?
How could you treat your friend 
like this?
Why are you like this?
What is this?
(Laughs)
(Laughs)
Come over here, 
please don't keep this.
This is the scene 
from the scene from the film 
"Hwayugi".
"It has been a long time 
since I last met with friends. 
I have changed."
(Cries)
"This is the first time 
you met me in a long time. 
You did not know that 
the person you welcomed back 
was really me."
"There is no one 
who can stand by me now."
"I am really sorry."
(Actors)
"It is fine.
If this situation happens, 
I will be able to survive alone."
"There is no one 
who will be there for me."
(Sobs)
What are you crying for?
Do you understand?
If you want to get something like this, 
you need to work hard.
Like this.
Your name is... 
No, your name is...
(Yoo Ah In (Laughs))
What's wrong with my lips?
Huh?
What's wrong with my lips?
(Chuckles)
Please do not act like this.
This is a simple roleplay, 
I need to see the guests.
Yes. I understand.
I understand.
I know.
(Chuckles)
(Laughs)
I'm a monster.
What are you doing?
The actors will be here 
on the day.
That's it. 
Now, go and study again.
Oh no.
Wait!
(Screams)
Are you hurt?
Are you okay?
(Surprised)
I was running away from you 
and you stopped at the wrong place.
Do you think that was wise?
Yes.
(Screams)
Did you get hurt?
What happened?
Why are you trembling?
Because I saw blood.
It is nothing.
Is your hand hurt?
No, it is nothing.
(Sobs)
(Sobs)
Hey!
(Screams)
Why are you screaming?
It's nothing.
You really shouldn't 
get into such situations.
I got so worried.
What are you talking about?
No, it is nothing.
Hey.
You are not going to use 
the cast from today.
It is not because it is broken.
I am not going to stop 
because of a few bad reviews.
Really?
Yes.
It looks like that 
you did not rest enough yesterday.
(Laughs)
I am a genius.
Did you sleep yesterday?
No.
Don't you think that I slept enough?
Yeah, you must sleep well.
How do you think you are 
going to look on stage?
You can just act like 
yourself as you were before.
Why do you need to act?
Look over here.
(Screams)
It is a secret weapon.
(Laughs)
(Laughs)
You need to prepare 
a different weapon for each show.
(Laughs)
(Laughs)
- This one...
- Is this a knife?
Yes, it is a knife.
How about this?
(Screams)
Wait.
(Screams)
How can you just do that?
Do you know how frightening 
that was for me?
When you don't do that, 
there is no fun in acting.
I was so scared.
But I am not doing this anymore.
I will get back into that position.
Get back in your position.
I will not let this happen again.
(Screams)
You are so cute.
- Come here.
- Yes.
Haven't you seen the knife 
since the day you became a star?
How could you just hold it like that?
You're really cute.
How can you hold it like that?
You're really cute.
Hurry up.
Hurry up and hold it.
Look at that scary face.
I can't hold it anymore.
(Screams)
How can you just push 
your knife and get out of my way?
What?
Hurry up and hold it.
Me?
You are my senior.
I will hold it for you.
Hurry up and hold it.
Why?
Please show me your hands.
Don't move.
(Laughs)
(Laughs)
Hurry up and show them your hands.
Why?
Yes.
(Laughs)
Oh!
(Laughs)
It is really scary!
(Laughs)
You're so cute.
(Laughs)
- Give it to me.
- Here.
(Screams)
(Laughs)
Hurry up.
Why are you being like that?
Come here and do it.
(Laughs)
The knife is mine.
Oh no.
(Laughs)
You really like it, 
don't you?
I think you love knives more than me.
(Laughs)
You really love knives.
I don't know how 
you</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:13
