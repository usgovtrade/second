In front of him, Quiggly spotted his enemy, Quigly the other, sitting at his kitchen table on the other side of the room. Quigly had a newspaper laid out in front of him, his left hand, balled into a fist, resting on the edge of the table, an angry red angry mark starting to form.

"Quiggly! I see you have once again shown your true colours by invading my abode, a place that was meant for humans, not you. You're just like those other filthy gremlins that were here."

Quiggly said nothing, Quiggly stayed quiet, as Quigly continued, "You are a blight on this race and are deserving of being cast into a pit of lava and flame."

Quiggly stayed where he was, unable to bring himself to answer back to the other gremlin. He'd never felt threatened or even angry in the presence of the other gremlins, they were so nice, they seemed so kind.

Quigly raised the newspaper in his fist and pointed at it and started yelling, "And I've got proof here of the terrible evil you have perpetrated against my family and friends."

He picked up a photo and held it towards Quiggly and continued, "You can see the damage and destruction that the gremlins caused in this picture here."

Quiggly's ears perked up and he realised Quigly had found him out, Quigly had found the picture in which he had appeared out of the blue, looking shocked, as the house exploded.

As he realised what had happened, it all became clear to him, what had happened, he wasn't going crazy, he wasn't experiencing a delusion, it was real, it was as real as it could be, they had done it, they had driven him crazy, and he was now seeing it in the form of the gremlins.

It was real! The gremlins had done this to him, tricking him into thinking he was crazy so that they could gain access to the house, and had they been looking for something? The picture in the newspaper, what was it? Why had he been there and what did they want?

He had been so happy at the time and had been in a good mood and his family had been happy too, but how could the gremlins have known he was feeling so happy? He hadn't been anywhere, they couldn't have known, unless they had used magic and were casting spells and casting spells and using magic, there was no way that would be possible.

No way, they could not have been using magic, it was not possible, magic didn't work in the real world, it was in fairy tales and it was never real, he needed to prove it was not real, he had to prove they weren't using magic, if they were, then it could not be real, it must be a delusion, it was a delusion, he had imagined it and it had to be a delusion, if he was insane then he was, he was just as crazy as they were.

He had to convince himself he was insane, he had to prove it, he wasn't insane, he was just as sane as anyone else and he had to prove that he was sane and that the gremlins were not using magic.

He looked back at the picture on the table and realised that the gremlins had caused the explosion, as he looked closely, he noticed they had their faces painted red and could see their horns and claws. They didn't look like gremlins, they were dressed in regular clothes and their faces were completely different, they were dressed as humans and they had human shaped faces.

What did that mean? They were disguised as humans and had to have been hiding their true form. Gremlins didn't wear clothes, didn't have real human shapes, this was proof of it, but it wasn't proof that magic wasn't at work, they had obviously found a way to make their disguises work.

Quiggly knew they must have used magic to make the disguise work, otherwise, they would have had to have hidden in his house, in the garden, under the carpets and in the ceiling, and they would have had to have made a hole in the wall so that they could get into the house.

The picture had to be a fake, it was just a picture of some gremlins that had been doing a survey, like they did sometimes in the middle of the night. The picture was nothing to do with him and they had been there for some reason, not just to check out his house, but to do something to him, but what?

He knew it was a fake, the picture, he could tell it was fake, it wasn't showing them doing any magic, they didn't have any type of magical devices and weren't doing anything, but why did the newspaper reporter say that they were dangerous? That didn't make sense and it was crazy, they were the ones that were causing the problem, not the other way around, but there was no proof of that, it was only a reporter saying it.

But why did they even need to get into his house? They knew all the entrances, they knew he used to go home to his family, so why did they need to go to his house, it didn't make sense, it was nonsense and it didn't make sense, he would have to prove it wasn't.

Quiggly didn't like it, this didn't seem like anything to do with his gremlin friends, this was something to do with them, with the other gremlins, and if it was him doing this then why? He would have to prove that he was sane and that it wasn't him doing it.

The gremlin's plan was beginning to become clearer to him, if he could understand the gremlin's plan then he could work out what to do to stop it and he could stop the gremlins, but what was the gremlin's plan? The only thing he could see, in that picture was they had taken measurements and made a mark on the wall, but why were they doing that? What were they doing it for?

There was no way that they were just there to take measurements, no matter what they were doing, there was no way that was it, they were looking for something, looking for something or looking for someone, maybe someone had given them instructions to take a survey, but how could that be? Who was doing this?

How did he know they were going to come back the next day to finish the survey? How did they know how long they had been there and why did they do it? How did the gremlins know that? They couldn't have, how could they have known? How could they have been in the house if they didn't come in through the door? And if they weren't doing it on their own then who was helping them?

Where had they been when the family was moving? What were they doing? What were they doing now? Who was going to teach him how to control his magic? How did they know they were going to attack his family and friends?

Quiggly looked back at the newspaper and picked up the photo and started looking at it, he could see it, he could see it, there were some numbers on the picture, numbers that he didn't understand, numbers like 3.1, 17.4 and 56.1. It looked a little bit like some numbers he'd seen before but how did they fit together, what did they mean?

He'd had a piece of paper and a pencil once before that looked similar to that and he didn't understand it, a man had given it to him, a man that he had seen a few times before but hadn't remembered the last time he saw him and he didn't know who he was, but it was a picture that someone had shown him, it was someone who lived with the man that had given him the piece of paper, but why did that man give it to him, why had he even given it to him?

It was all just noise, all these numbers, this didn't make any sense, if they were important then they would be important, he would have to find out what they meant. He had a thought and asked himself what they might mean, it was just a silly thought, numbers meant things, didn't they?

The numbers meant something, it could be anything, it could be anything. He would have to prove it meant something, it must be something, it couldn't be nothing.

The newspaper article said that the gremlins had turned up in different places in the world, from Paris to London, that must mean that there were more gremlins than he had ever known about, and it was not just his imagination, it was really happening. He couldn't be crazy, it was not a dream, it was real, this had happened, he knew it was true, he knew that they had been there.

He would have to go and find out what had happened, he would have to find out where those gremlins had been, who they had been, why they had turned up there. Why had they turned up there and what had they done there, and what had he done here, he would have to find out. He needed to know why they had gone</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:15
