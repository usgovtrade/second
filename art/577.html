"I don't want to play this game anymore." "I want to go to "La Llorona"." "What is "La Llorona"?" "What's with "Llorona"?" "That's not funny!" "You can't fool me!" "I'm so much younger than you!" "I'm coming over to your house." "Yes, I'm younger than you." "What was that you said?" "The "Llorona"." "Why are you so weird?" "Don't you want to know what I said?" "Why do you keep saying weird things like this?" "Don't you want to dance with me?" "You don't have to get upset." "All right." "Let's go to my house." "Where should I put my towel?" "You don't need to show your bottom." "Just stay there." "You don't want to?" "What do you mean?" "You don't want to?" "Don't be scared of me." "I'm scared of you?" "You are, aren't you?" "No, I'm not!" "You didn't want to go." "No, I don't want to go." "You can come with me to "La Llorona"." "Don't be scared!" "Don't be scared!" "Stop acting like that." "What are you doing?" "Stop!" "What do you want?" "Don't go crazy, will you?" "La Llorona is going to eat your little body." "I can't hear you!" "You can't hear me?" "Don't touch me!" "I can hear you." "No, I can't hear you!" "Don't worry, I will leave here with you!" "What do you mean by "with me"?" "No, don't go crazy!" "Stop!" "Don't touch me!" "I can hear you." "I can hear you." "No, I can't hear you." "You can't hear me?" "I heard you, stop it!" "What?" "I don't hear anything." "I do hear." "I don't hear anything." "La Llorona doesn't hear you!" "You're making up a story." "Now listen to me." "Do you see what I'm going to do?" "Now there is not a sound." "The lights, the doors, everything." "Why are you running?" "Listen, I have to take a shower." "What are you going to do?" "La Llorona is going to eat you!" "Don't scare me!" "No!" "Don't be afraid!" "La Llorona doesn't eat anymore!" "I heard you, but I wasn't hearing you." "Are you playing with me?" "No." "Let me out!" "La Llorona doesn't exist!" "Come back!" "La Llorona!" "Don't make me get angry, I swear." "I'll stop now." "What have you done?" "What have you done?" "Who is this?" "What are you doing?" "What are you doing?" "Why do you leave me at this hour?" "Why?" "Don't leave me alone." "Are you drunk?" "So what?" "It's just that..." "Let me sleep, please." "Calm down." "My mother's awake." "Let me sleep." "You can sleep in the next room." "I can't hear you." "Let me sleep." "Don't close the door." "I can't hear you." "You hear me, right?" "Don't close the door." "Please, don't close the door." "You'll have to leave." "I cannot leave her in the bedroom." "What are you saying?" "I want to sleep here with her." "I have to sleep on this side of the bed." "Are you leaving?" "I don't want to talk to you anymore." "You've already spoken too much." "Don't be mad at me because of the other night." "I don't care what happens to you." "Go away!" "Don't leave me alone!" "Go away!" "What's wrong with you?" "What are you doing?" "Are you sleeping?" "I love you, mom." "You're not sleeping." "What do you want?" "Let's leave, mom." "What is it?" "I don't know." "I want to leave here." "Let's get out of here." "I don't want to go." "What?" "I don't want to go." "Let's leave here." "You don't want to?" "I don't want to leave here." "You know what's waiting for us?" "We know what we're going to do there." "You don't know how to make love with me." "Where is your body?" "Here you are." "You have to do what I say." "Okay?" "If you leave here, who's going to take care of me?" "And who's going to take care of you?" "Mom." "Who?" "It's me, your son." "You don't have the strength." "I know you, they've made you like this." "What do you know about me?" "I know what I have to do." "I don't want you to do this for me." "I want to keep you." "Yes, you." "Let's go." "It's me." "Your son." "Who is it?" "What is it?" "Don't you remember your son?" "I don't know who you are." "You know that." "I'm your son!" "Don't look at me like that." "I know I look like I did at your age, but I'm your son." "Yes, yes." "I'm your son." "What?" "No!" "Don't you remember me?" "Who is it?" "What is it?" "I don't know you." "You're confused." "It's me." "Your son." "No." "I'm your son." "Who is it?" "Don't try to make me think of someone else." "No one else!" "I'm the only son you have." "Your son, your blood, your nerves!" "What are you saying?" "No." "I'm the only one." "How can you be?" "How can you be my son?" "I am your son." "I have never been away." "I am your son!" "Who are you?" "You have to understand!" "It can't be possible." "It's not possible!" "It's not possible!" "Who are you?" "My son!" "Yes." "It is you." "Yes." "You are my son!" "My son!" "You have come back." "You've finally come back!" "It's you!" "No, I don't want it." "Leave me alone." "Come back." "Come back." "I don't need anything." "Don't take that." "The boy is fine." "I didn't see it." "Come on." "Take it." "Come on." "Don't be afraid, you'll see." "It's okay." "Don't be afraid." "You're already dead." "I saw him die." "Don't be scared." "When we see them," "They've already died." "Don't be scared." "It doesn't hurt." "That's the only way I can see them." "Why didn't you leave?" "I had to make the rounds." "Why did you stay there?" "I have an obligation to all the dead people in my village." "Why?" "Because they aren't in the cemetery." "They're at the bottom of the river." "Now you have to go away." "Everyone is waiting for you." "If I go, they'll scare me again." "The boy stays here." "I'm not afraid of anything." "I want to sleep here with you." "Don't leave me." "You cannot stay with me." "Only one person can stay with me." "Why didn't you leave?" "I don't know what I'm going to do." "When I see them, I also want to leave." "I want to leave, but I want to die right there, near them." "Who makes me stay?" "You." "Aren't you afraid of me?" "I've never been afraid." "Why didn't you leave?" "If I went away, they would be alone." "Who?" "The dead people." "And what about you?" "I don't know." "Sometimes, I feel that if I leave them," "I'd die." "We could live together." "You're a coward!" "You should have left." "Yes." "I'm a coward." "You're a coward!" "You don't love the dead ones." "You don't love them." "You don't love them at all." "You don't love them." "All you care about is yourself." "You love the living ones." "You know, every day I ask why you don't leave, why you're always here with me." "But I know that it's not you who wants to be here." "You don't want to." "You love me." "Don't you know that I'd give my life for you?" "Only for you." "You." "You are so disgusting."
