The Chain

I could not stop my chain,
I tried to get out,
But there is no escape,
A spell, that I am bound.

I can't stop my chain,
It won't stop, it won't,
The devil is in it,
He feeds me with fear.

I can't fight it,
I can't run, I can't hide,
But I feel it inside,
I want to scream out loud,
There's nothing left to lose.

I tried to hide,
I tried to run,
But it still haunts me,
And it keeps me from you.

The chains that bound you,
That's in you, that's why.
The chains that bound you,
They're in you.

You, it, me,
When I saw you,
The chains were no more,
It was love, not fear.

How can love, be evil,
They're our chains,
But we never noticed.
How can love be evil.

Why does a chain,
From it's master,
Need to be a slave?
What makes it, so hard to see,
If you see with love?

Is it the chains, that bind us?
Or, can love be the chain?

The Chain

I found you on the street,
I got you to my home,
I took you away from harm,
But something held me back.

I want you to stay,
But, I know, that you won't,
You have a chain,
That binds me.

It's killing me,
To let you go.
But you got to go,
There's nothing more that I can do.

The chains, that bind us,
In ourselves.
We never really saw.
Until we loved at all.

If we see love, will it be evil?
Will it bind us from another?
This is the problem.

Will we let chains be our master,
And we won't break free,
Or will we see love as our god?
And then, chains, would be the devil?

The Chain

There's nothing more, I can do,
My chain, I was bound by.
I can't do anything about,
The devil inside me.

The devil, is in me,
I can't stop, I'll be damned,
I can't get away,
I can't hide, I'm here.
I'm chained, I'm bound by love.

How can this be real,
The devil is inside me.
Why did I never see,
Until you broke my heart.
My body belongs to you.

You can break my chains,
That bind me, this must end.
The chains you put on me,
You've got to take them off.
You have to break this spell.

I've got to break this spell.

Love is good.
And everything that has love,
In it's heart,
Is real and love bound,
This is love.

I'm chained and bound to you.
But I feel the love,
That you bring me, inside.
I'm now free from my chains.

The Devil Inside Me

They all see, my evil,
In me.

There is no evil,
It's just the chain,
That binds me, to love.

The devil has come out,
In everyone.

I can't stop this.
I am in chains,
And I can't break free,
From this spell.

I was bound by my heart,
When I was a child,
Now, it binds me.
To love you.

There is no escape.
I am now tied to love.
I cannot escape.
I can't stop, I can't move.
I am now tied to love.

I am tied to my life,
And to love, I must give.
I don't want to die.
And be gone, from this world.
But this chain, that holds me,
Won't let me go,
And there's no one else,
To help me, to let me go.
This chain that I'm tied to,
Keeps me from another.
He is my friend.
The devil inside me.

He gave me a gift.
Of love, to take him from me.
But now I'm tied to him.
I can't tell him how I feel.
I can't let him go.
I'm locked in this spell.
Bound by the devil inside.
Inside me.

So I sit here and cry,
Because I can't break free.
The chain, that binds me.
From love, because I love you.

I think, I may die,
My chains keep me from life.
I can't see you anymore.
Because I love you so much.

I love you,
For your love,
To keep me,
I do this for you.

No one can love you like I do,
Because they can't love you like I do,
I can't see you anymore.
I can't see you anymore.

You've got to know, I can't let go.
If you know I love you.
If you know I love you.

With you, I can be myself.
You love me for who I am.
You have given me a gift.
That I love to keep.
So now I love you,
For your love,
To keep me,
I do this for you.

I can't see you anymore.
Because I love you so much.
I love you for your love.

I love you,
For your love,
You've given me.
I will keep your love with me,
For my life.

I'm so sorry I had to run away.
I'm sorry that I was afraid.
I had to leave you alone.
My heart, it ached for you.

I know that you loved me for me,
And that you loved me even when I was scared.
The devil was in my heart.
And it took me to the end.

I think you know, that I love you so,
But I cannot tell you.
You see, it's the devil, inside me.

So this is what happens,
When I have seen you,
When I was alone,
And I was sad, and scared.
And the devil, inside me,
Made me run, away from you.
Made me run from love.

I have to run, but I cannot run away.
My love, I want to hold.
I have to love you,
I've loved you for so long.
You've been by my side.
I never thought I'd go through,
Such a hard time.
I had to go, away.
Because I have to love you.

So, I've decided I will try,
To be with you, forever and ever.
I will not run away.
We will be together.
And we'll be free from my heart.
It will still beat and it will still feel.

We'll sit under the trees,
All of our days.
And we'll watch the sun rise.
And we'll be free.
Forever and ever, and forever and ever.
Forever and ever, forever and ever, and forever.
Forever and ever, forever and ever.

You see, this is love.
It is not a chain.
Not when you love someone.
It's how you live.

Sometimes, it's hard to show.
I know it's hard to see,
But you'll be free from me,
Forever and ever.
Forever and ever, and forever and ever.
Forever and ever, forever and ever.

Oh, I want to tell you,
And I can't leave you, I never will.
The devil in me,
I hate it, it's killing me.
It's haunting me.
It's evil, and it's in me.
It's killing me.

Oh, I have to hold you,
And tell you, I love you.
I can't tell you,
I don't want to let go of your hand, of your heart.
