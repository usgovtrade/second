At the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, our goal is to help you transform vision health by connecting with our academic and medical team. During your first appointment, you'll meet with a family physician who can explain your condition in detail and discuss treatment options. Together, you can decide on the right plan for you. At your appointment, we'll make sure that you're comfortable, knowledgeable about your condition, and ready to proceed with the care plan you've chosen.

What Are Cataracts?

Cataracts develop when your lens of the eye grows cloudy, reducing your vision. There are two types of cataracts: those that develop over time and cause cloudy vision gradually and those that develop all at once.

Age-related cataracts occur when cloudiness is caused by a long-term reaction to normal aging processes in the body, such as with age-related macular degeneration. They typically cause visual impairment but they don't impair your other senses. Cataracts that occur suddenly and dramatically, such as from eye trauma, are referred to as traumatic cataracts.

How to Protect Your Vision:

In the winter and spring months, it is important to wear sunglasses that provide 100 percent UV protection. These are designed specifically to block the most intense levels of the sun's rays. To keep your eyes healthy during the daytime, try to look away from a source of bright light every 20 to 30 minutes. Also, as a daily routine, wear your sunglasses when you're driving, jogging, or participating in another sport.

The sooner you get treatment for cataracts, the better. Although some cataracts can be removed during cataract surgery, once it has begun, it is usually too late to slow down or stop cataract development.

What Is Diabetic Retinopathy?

Diabetic retinopathy is a condition in which changes in the small blood vessels of the eye cause severe vision problems. The blood vessels can swell and leak blood into the space between the retina and the back of the eye.

This complication of diabetes can lead to retinal bleeding, retinal detachment, or glaucoma. Diabetic retinopathy affects the majority of people with diabetes and can lead to blindness. Risk factors include:

Type 1 or 2 diabetes

Having had diabetes for a long time

Older age

Having high blood pressure

Having high cholesterol

Women who become pregnant

Symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy doesn't cause symptoms in all people with diabetes. Most people with diabetes have no symptoms. However, in some cases, the first symptoms are problems with your night vision, such as seeing bright lights. Others may see floating, blurred images, see flashing lights, or see shadows instead of images.

These changes can result in blurred vision, eye pain, loss of vision, or loss of central vision. People may see areas of decreased vision or what they call "floaters." Over time, these symptoms may become more serious and lead to blindness.

What Are Glaucoma and Cataracts?

Glaucoma is a disease that affects the optic nerve of your eye and can eventually lead to blindness. Glaucoma is caused when pressure builds up in the eye because of a defect in the drainage system of the eye. There are two forms of glaucoma: open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma.

Open-angle glaucoma means that the drainage system of the eye is not blocked, but the optic nerve is damaged. Patients may have no symptoms or they may experience loss of peripheral vision. Angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by narrowed drainage angle. When this happens, the angle becomes closed, leading to blockage of the drainage channel and increase of pressure in the eye. Because of this, there are more symptoms than in open-angle glaucoma. For example, these people may experience eye pain, changes in vision, and decreased peripheral vision.

Cataracts are cloudy patches in the lens of the eye, which can impair eyesight.

Glaucoma and Cataracts:

You can develop glaucoma before cataracts. It is important to see a healthcare provider about glaucoma early because it can cause damage to the optic nerve and vision loss, especially if you have open-angle glaucoma. If you have cataracts, it is important to have regular eye examinations to keep your eyes safe and to keep the progression of cataracts from worsening.

Causes of Glaucoma

Glaucoma can be caused by:

Normal age-related changes

Heredity

Stress

High eye pressure

High blood pressure

Long-term eye inflammation

Symptoms of Glaucoma

Glaucoma symptoms can vary from person to person, but some common signs include:

Blurred vision (progressive vision loss)

Nighttime blindness (vision loss during the night or driving)

Intense headaches (which are usually worse in the morning and occur more often)

What Are Macular Degeneration and Retinal Disease?

Macular degeneration and retinal disease can cause severe vision problems, such as blindness. Macular degeneration can also cause loss of central vision, which is how you see objects directly in front of you, as well as your peripheral vision.

How It Develops:

Age-related macular degeneration is caused by the overgrowth of thin, new blood vessels in the back of the eye. This growth can cause damage to the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Age-related macular degeneration may also occur in other places in the body, including the middle layer of the eye, known as the retina.

Macular degeneration can be divided into two types:

Dry macular degeneration occurs when the nutrients in the macula are not able to support the photoreceptor cells that feed the macula. This can cause central vision loss in the middle of the visual field.

Wet macular degeneration is caused by damage to the macula by the overgrowth of blood vessels that leak fluids and blood in the middle of the eye. This damage can be caused by age-related macular degeneration or a blood vessel injury.

Symptoms of Macular Degeneration:

Macular degeneration does not affect everyone in the same way. However, people with age-related macular degeneration may experience:

Decreased central vision

Increased sensitivity to glare

Loss of central vision

Increased sensitivity to glare

Eye pain, especially when driving at night

Causes of Macular Degeneration:

Macular degeneration does not have a known cause. However, it is often associated with:

Exposure to high levels of sunlight (at a young age)

Diabetes and other diseases (diabetic retinopathy)

Aging (macular degeneration usually begins after age 60)

How Macular Degeneration and Retinal Disease Progress:

Age-related macular degeneration usually develops over a period of years, although it can also develop suddenly, leading to total blindness within weeks. Retinal disease progresses differently. It begins with loss of central vision and a gradual loss of peripheral vision.

How to Prevent Macular Degeneration:

The best way to prevent macular degeneration is to keep your macula healthy by:

Keeping your eyes well hydrated

Eating a well-balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables

Undergoing eye examinations regularly

Keeping your skin healthy by protecting it from the sun with sunscreen and wearing protective clothing and eyewear that blocks ultraviolet rays

Eliminating smoking and taking steps to reduce other risk factors for heart disease, such as having a low-sugar, high-fiber diet and taking a daily walk

Avoiding situations that require you to strain your eyes

Diagnosing Macular Degeneration:

Macular degeneration can usually be diagnosed by looking at your eye and noticing changes to your central vision.

In some cases, doctors may also use a special instrument called an ophthalmoscope to examine the inside of your eye.

Presbyopia, or the need to hold reading material at arm's length, is the most common cause of vision problems in older adults.

What Is Presbyopia?

Presbyopia is a condition in which your eye loses its ability to focus on nearby objects clearly. Usually, this causes trouble with reading, driving, and other close-up activities. Many people need glasses for activities that involve distance vision as well. Over time, symptoms of presbyopia may lessen with age.

Presbyopia affects approximately 25 percent of adults over age 40. It is caused when a person's lens in the eye becomes less flexible and more curved, making it hard for</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:52:58
