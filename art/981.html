the need to increase the velocity and the level of confidence of market players 
when entering into these deals.

In order to do that, we have decided to focus only on those aspects which 
were considered non-critical in previous evaluations, while the other, more 
critical, aspects will remain under review. As a consequence we will 
probably have to sacrifice some additional features considered extremely 
important in the past.

To this respect, we are reviewing the possibility of changing the following:  

Deal Coding:

- the key-name, which is the primary key-name in the system, will continue to 
be the Reference ID, as agreed with Risk Controls.

- the description of each product has been reviewed to be more concise. The 
positioning of every item has been re-considered in order to facilitate the 
filtering  
from a different point of view. 

Each counterparty will have to identify the GTC/GTC limit we are going to 
trade (even if they are the same as the one already expressed in the product 
description) when submitting the request to Enter a New Deal.


Credit, Legal, Operations

It has been decided that in order to increase the velocity and the 
level of confidence of Enron Market Participants, an automatic confirmation 
letter would not be issued. This implies that  Deal Confirmations will have 
to be sent manually.
 

I would like to point out that this is a result of the recommendations that 
did not find their way into the first version, but as Market Confidence is 
not something you can just switch on and off it's crucial that we get these 
sorts of decisions right.

Again, thank you for the valuable contribution.

Andreas

Subject: Steel Physical Products; Follow-up on Steel Confirmation Letters

I recently sent each of you a memo regarding the status of the commercial and 
legal teams on the processing of a final version of the Steel Physical 
Product Long Descriptions.  Attached, for your reference, is a memo from 
Travis McCullough, Managing Director of Steel Origination, which summarizes 
the current status of the product descriptions.

As you can see, there are still a few issues remaining, the most important of 
which is the product description for Selmony Hickok, the 1/48 scale J-61. 
There are two issues here: (1) an important commercial point (i.e., pricing) 
and (2) our legal obligations.

Please call me with any questions.
