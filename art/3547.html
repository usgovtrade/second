What's this blog about?

I am not a scholar or expert in anything but an “armchair traveler” who loves to travel and learn more about the world, about people, history, and especially about the cultures that makes it rich in arts, fashion, food, design, music, literature, etc. My passion is traveling by boat in tropical regions and I love all things water, adventure and wild!

Join me on this journey! Tell me what you think. I would love to hear from you!
