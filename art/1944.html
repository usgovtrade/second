VIDEO: "Bamboozled" Music Video

A clip from “Bamboozled” is now available at nbc.com. Here is a synopsis of the video:

"‘Bamboozled’ is a new single and video that addresses the dangers of falling for scams. The song tells the story of an unsuspecting man who finds himself in a web of frauds and lies after he accidentally posts personal information online. The song has powerful lyrics with a catchy chorus, ‘Cause I’m lost in a jungle of lies / The big lies make me lose my identity / And I can’t find my way out / In a world gone bamboozled.’

“We wanted to bring awareness to a timely subject,” says the song’s writer, Jermaine Dupri. “It’s important for people to be aware of things like identity theft because you don’t want to become part of the statistics. If you get a letter in the mail that says something is wrong, go to the police. If you have doubts, go to the police. It’s not going to cost you much more than time to put a stop to it. The FBI’s National Cyber Crime Division reported that between 2004 and 2009, identity fraud losses hit $5.8 billion. We hope that our video provides people with the information they need to keep their information private.”

“Bamboozled” has an uptempo beat that features a catchy beat, funky guitar solo and hip-hop beat that perfectly showcases the band’s signature sound. The video tells the story of a young man who is about to be scammed. It opens with a young woman in a black and white striped sweater wearing a backpack. While riding her bike through the woods, she slips on a patch of bamboo. Catching herself, she stops. There’s a flash of light, and she loses her backpack.

Suddenly, the camera goes through the back of a car to discover a young man wearing a bright yellow shirt and sitting in a car seat. The car drives off into the distance as a young man in a blue and white striped sweater walks through the jungle. As he tries to follow the car, a second car appears, and this one pulls up and flashes its headlights as the man is about to catch up. As the car continues on its way, the second young man tries to get inside. But the person inside rejects him and drives off into the night.

In a third scene, the man in the yellow shirt and blue and white striped sweater is at a convenience store at night. Suddenly, he hears what sounds like someone knocking on the door. The video then cuts back to the young woman trying to reach her lost backpack as she cycles through the woods. As she passes the man in the yellow shirt who’s walking around with a flashlight, he flashes it in her face to scare her. Then he drops it and is forced to pick it up as he loses his balance and falls over.

A man in a trench coat passes by. He takes out a camera phone and captures pictures of the woman. The video ends with a close-up of the woman holding up her backpack as two people approach from the left. The woman in the trench coat smiles and looks at the camera. He is the one who’s been scamming her all along.

In addition to Mr. Dupri, “Bamboozled” features the members of Young Money as well as former Young Money artists and current friends Lil Wayne, Styles P, Hurricane Chris and T-Pain.

On “Bamboozled,” Lil Wayne gives perhaps his most soulful vocal performance in years. It’s not what you would expect from a man with a penchant for colorful and controversial statements. “I never used to talk about God but my voice started hurting,” he says in the track’s opening verse. “When my voice started going, I asked God to give me strength.”

The second verse finds Lil Wayne explaining that he’s “been bamboozled and my emotions are bruised.” After another verse, he’s able to find some levity: “I’m the King of New York, I’m that mutha f—in’ Wayne.”

Dupri wanted to bring this story to life using an urban setting, so the video was shot in New York. “I’ve got all the street cred in the world,” Dupri says of the video. “I love it because I’ve grown up in Harlem and I think people from Harlem have a different perspective on things. That’s who Lil Wayne is.”

“When I decided I wanted to do ‘Bamboozled’ and do it through YMCMB, I knew it had to be more of a story,” Dupri says. “I thought the best place to do that would be New York. I wanted to do a video in New York because New York is the home of hip-hop.”

Years ago, Dupri was approached by a New York City rapper named 50 Cent to collaborate. “I wasn’t as focused as I am now, but I knew that 50 Cent’s energy would have an impact on hip-hop culture,” Dupri says. “He was a hot head at the time and did a little bit of everything. As I look back at it, he was a pioneer.”

“I’m thinking about 50 Cent, I’m thinking about the rap. That’s what I like about ‘Bamboozled,’” Dupri says. “There’s some funky guitar, a little bit of soul. It’s a fun song. We wrote it in such a way that if you’re a fan of hip-hop, it speaks to you on multiple levels.”

Dupri first introduced the world to Young Money in 2005 with “Money To Blow.” And while he’s had hits, including “Gigolo” and “Got Money,” “Bamboozled” marks a breakthrough in his career for several reasons. This is the first time the label he heads — which includes Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj — has released a video.

“The whole time I was making this video, people were just running around,” Dupri says. “They just wanted to get the shots and stuff. Everybody is so talented, they just gave me so much material. It took them a long time to put this together. They gave me so much, it was amazing.”

The “Bamboozled” video is more personal than the other videos Dupri has made. “I wrote ‘Bamboozled’ with the intent to tell a story,” he says. “I put some effort into making sure it all came together. When I was making this video, I could see the potential. This is my way of letting people know that ‘Bamboozled’ was the first video Young Money had made, and it’s like a tribute to New York. It speaks to me on so many levels.”

The last time Young Money released a full-length, Grammy Award-winning album was “We Are Young Money,” a group compilation. “We Are Young Money 2,” which Lil Wayne and DJ Khaled are both executive producing, is due for release next month.

While Dupri did not take time to celebrate when the “Bamboozled” video came together, he is enjoying the fruits of his labor. “I’m going to work on the record and go back to New York, and this video will be on the streets, and the song will be out,” Dupri says. “I can’t wait to come out with the ‘Bamboozled’ video. I can feel it already. It’s really going to change everything. That’s the most excited I’ve been about anything I’ve done in my career.”

“I wanted to make ‘Bamboozled’ before ‘Bamboozled,’” he continues. “I was doing my radio show one day and I was telling my host and my engineer that I wanted to make a ‘Bamboozled’ video. They were like, ‘Dude, we just did ‘Bamboozled.’ I said, ‘We need to do a ‘Bamboozled’ video.’”

“Bamboozled” does not feature Young Money artist Drake, who is a longtime collaborator of Dupri. “In the making of ‘Bamboozled,’ we put out the call and said, ‘If you have a song you want to do with me, we’d love to have you on it. Whoever wants to make a song with me, we’ll do it.’ Everybody from Young Money was making a song. Every one of them responded and made a song. Some of them were songs that were already released or were coming out. We’ve got so many great records.”

The Young Money collective is as close-knit as the family involved. “All of us are very protective over Young Money,” Dupri says. “People are always saying that Young Money is bigger than any one person. This project is something where</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:44
