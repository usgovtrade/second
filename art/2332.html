Awakening from the Matrix ‚Äì Oneness and Separateness

http://www.awakeningwithin.com Awakening Within ‚Äì Audio Guided Meditation ‚Äì A deep meditation on Oneness, Oneness and Separateness ‚Äì a perfect meditation for a special anniversary or birthday or to receive a message from your Higher Self. ‚Äì Learn more from me about Spiritual Awakening, Meditation, Consciousness, Spiritual Emergency, etc. at http://www.AwakeningWithin.com

Love the World and Unite Together

This beautiful audio meditation was created by Michael Leunig in the years 1984-5. The main focus of this audio meditation is Love as an Energy ‚Äì an energy that is a very important aspect of the divine plan, which is to Love as much as possible (especially people and Earth). This audio meditation is very powerful and life-changing. Please also watch the video with it, as it serves as an introduction to the meditation itself.
As you know, our planet is suffering a lot at the moment. This audio meditation will make you feel a strong, loving desire to take action for love and for making this planet a peaceful place. In order to change the current reality, we need an even bigger collective consciousness to Love. And we can achieve this only by creating a deeper collective Love, which can‚Äôt happen if we do not Love ourselves.
The main point of the meditation is this: We can do much more to help others and to achieve a positive future for all of us if we Love one another and create a deeper feeling of Love, which will bring this feeling everywhere. Love is a spiritual practice, because we need to feel Love in order to feel stronger, to feel our connection with the divine, and ultimately feel the Oneness that is a spiritual dimension.
In order to feel Love as an energy, we need to activate a part of our bodies that is responsible for this feeling, which is our heart center. The main issue of the Oneness Meditation is to activate your heart center, which will lead to higher levels of loving feelings. Once you feel that you can love, it will be much easier to create the feeling that will spread in your life.
During this meditation you will create many new cells in the body, which will in a way become a ‚Äúbody of Love‚Äù. Each time you will repeat the meditation you will create new cells and new cells will lead to a stronger feeling of Love within you, which will be the new energy that will radiate through your heart center and the rest of your body.

Wake Up!

This is a recording of ‚ÄúAwakening From the Matrix ‚Äì A Guided Meditation‚Äù by The Awakening Within. This recording was done in June 2012 at the Awakening Now Retreat at the Castle Hill retreat center, located in Sonoma County California.
After making this recording I decided to go back to a deeper meditative state. This time I decided to connect with my ‚ÄúHigher Self‚Äù in a deep meditation. This part of the video contains this new and deeper experience of deeper meditation with the help of my Higher Self. This is only one of the five different meditations I did during the time of my retreat.

Mental Illness & Chronic Life Phobia

On an international level, I think we can agree that human existence on this planet is quite insane. There are wars, poverty, famine, the rise and fall of so many kingdoms and countless other forms of suffering that we should be able to do much better than this. But it seems that as many of us are waking up and being able to take our power back, our consciousness is taking over and we are in the process of transforming all of this.
The main point I would like to leave with you in this article is that every single one of us is going through his/her own personal growth and awakening process. This is my personal belief, as most of us are experiencing so many things that can‚Äôt be described by reason. This is not only happening with the mental illness we have all seen and lived through on this planet, but also with the process of getting rid of the life phobia we live with each day, without knowing why.
This meditation can be of great value to you if you are going through an intense phase in your life right now, whether it be a relationship break up, or the loss of a loved one, the loss of a job, loss of a country etc. The main purpose of this meditation is to wake up and remember that there are two ways in which life can show up for you. There is the way you see it and then there is the reality of how you see it. It is of great value if you feel that there is a purpose for all this happening, and in fact your purpose has to do with getting rid of whatever is not aligned with your higher-self, so that you can move forward and do your next level of spiritual development.
Please take the time to watch the video first, as it‚Äôs a very important message to help you understand the process better. After you watched the video please practice this meditation as much as possible. If it doesn‚Äôt work for you the first time, don‚Äôt worry, give it a second chance and after that you will be able to benefit from it much more easily. Please do not give up, even if it doesn‚Äôt work for the first few times. I know it‚Äôs hard but it takes time and if we stay consistent enough to give the process a chance, we will see this meditation will work for you. After you get the hang of it, you will be able to get to know the process better.
Thank you for your time, Alex. You can find more about this meditation at www.meditationforhealing.com.

Mental Illness & Chronic Life Phobia

I just wanted to share this message that was very powerful for me. In fact, I think it is one of the most powerful and important meditations that I ever heard! It is called ‚ÄúMental Illness & Chronic Life Phobia.‚Äù
In my audio meditations I try to share only things that can help you and add to your wisdom. One of these is about overcoming mental illness, what it is, why it happens, and also what to do in this situation, as this is one of the most important and most difficult situations you will ever go through.
In this meditation we will go through the process of dealing with a chronic mental illness and also how to deal with something that many of us are going through on a daily basis. Something that many of us think is the result of a broken brain, when in fact there is much more going on with it than this. In other words, I‚Äôm saying that we are all going through an inner healing process, and one of the reasons we are going through it is that in fact, we are all ‚Äúin the same boat.‚Äù At least that‚Äôs the way I see it, and in fact, it‚Äôs true to some extent.
Please take the time to listen and watch this meditation first before</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:20
