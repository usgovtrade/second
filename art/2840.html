When asked about the secret to getting up in the morning, many people respond that they set their alarm for the same time each day. They wake up even earlier than the day before, but never earlier than scheduled. This is a very effective way to be stuck in a rut. If you find yourself always getting up at the same time, it’s a sign you need to take some time for daily spiritual reflection.

My daily meditation is a personal journey through the Psalms, which I enjoy because of their deep spiritual message. Some people would call them “songs” or “poetry,” while others might be offended to even think of them as such. However, I view them more like a personal journal I write each morning and which gives me comfort through adversity.

Here are just some of the ideas I ponder while meditating. I find I have very specific questions each day that I can’t help but answer:

Is there a situation in my life that I need to forgive myself for?

What did I accomplish during the day?
