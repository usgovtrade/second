At first the change seemed to be going well. He got a job as a writer for a news site, and was asked to do freelance work for newspapers around the world, such as The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, and The New York Times. Even though he was leaving New York in August, when he visited his mother in Mexico he said he was doing much better than he had in Mexico City. The only problem was that even with the freedom of freelancing he was feeling "a little antsy."



"The last two years have been a little weird for me," Chavez said. "It's almost like I'm starting from scratch and trying to figure out what I want to do."

"My life changed after this job I quit, which is why I don't consider myself a 'couch' guy"



For a year and a half, from the spring of 2011 until the fall of 2013, Chavez was a freelancer for the Spanish-language website Univision. He says he loved his time at Univision, where he got the job after getting a cold call from the network.



"My life changed after this job I quit, which is why I don't consider myself a 'couch' guy," Chavez said. "When I'm working from home, I'm basically a computer nerd or a geek. I'm going back to that state of mind."



Chavez decided to move to Manhattan after talking with a friend in Miami who said she had just gotten a cool job and life was good. Chavez's friend said it didn't even matter that she was dating the person she ended up marrying, because dating in Miami "doesn't work."

"Miami is not the place for me," Chavez said. "I could have gotten a job in Miami, but Miami's just not the right fit for me."



Chavez, who didn't want to disclose his age, said he had recently been talking with a woman in her 20s about moving to New York, and he didn't want to get too serious, because he "might get hit by a bus."



He got the new apartment in the East Village and started to look for work.



"I'm still searching for something to do," Chavez said. "But I don't want to start anything until I've done a few projects and have something on my résumé."



Since his first day as a freelancer was in February, he said he started working for clients like a few weeks before he moved to New York. He found a good deal on a three-bedroom apartment, and also bought furniture, furniture he says he'd "be happy to take back with him" when the lease runs out.



That means he plans to be in the East Village for a few years.



"I'm sure I'll find a job as a journalist, but I'll need to take any writing job that I can get," Chavez said. "There's no such thing as unemployment in New York. You can't get away with doing nothing."

Chavez also said he has no regrets, despite what he will miss most about the city.



"I'm probably not going to be able to afford to live there, but I'll definitely keep in touch with my friends," he said.



"It's still early. Maybe I'm going to find a job and I won't need the apartment," he said. "New York is where dreams are made, but they're also broken."
