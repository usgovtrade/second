In the final showdown between the three, Rakoczi used his speed to run across the area.
This gave him the opportunity to attack Brick, knocking the latter unconscious, but only for a few seconds, because Brick recovered, and was still able to take out Rakoczi with his headbutt.
Meanwhile, Barney had climbed up to the top of the chimney, and was able to use his jetpack to attack Brick, whom had now returned to fighting Barney.
Rakoczi and Barney were at a stalemate when Brick decided to go for the fatal blow, sending his fist flying through the chimney and hitting Barney.
The fight between Rakoczi and Barney continued, and both fighters attacked each other.
Rakoczi was knocked off balance, and fell down onto the arena floor.
At that point, Barney got a chance to finish Rakoczi off, using his jetpack to run up the chimney and perform a dive kick onto Rakoczi's chest.
Brick was able to take out Barney this time, but it was too late for him to save the match.
His last attack on Barney was not enough to win him the match, so he got up, and walked off in disgust.
And just like that, this rivalry was over!
As for Rakoczi and Barney, they were left lying on the arena floor unconscious.
But they were eventually rescued by ambulance and taken to the hospital.
Both of the wrestlers received medical attention, and a check-up.
Thankfully they were both okay, and were released a few hours later.
But Brick had some major medical issues, which needed to be looked into.
After they left the hospital, Brick said he was going to leave the country.
Brick packed his bags, got into a taxi, and went to the airport.
When he arrived at the airport, he had a feeling that he wasn't going to be coming back.
He then boarded a plane, and flew off to Europe.
When he arrived in Europe, he spent some time looking for a job.
But Brick just couldn't find a job that suited him, because he was just not interested in making a career of wrestling.
Eventually, he decided to come back home.
He was just tired of the way wrestling was going.
The next time Brick was on stage, it was 20 years after his first match with Barney.
Brick's first performance was a one-man match against a guy called The Rotten Jap.
He had spent 20 years away from the business, and was very rusty.
Afterwards, Brick went off into retirement.
Afterword, the rivalry between Barney and Brick remained as one of the most epic rivalries of the WWE.
That is until the WWE brought back Brick as a computer generated image in the computer game, ''Titanium''.
And as of this year, he's been performing in the WWE under his real name, Matt O'Connor.
But as usual, things were not easy for him in his first outing back.
On top of that, he has also performed under the name The War Machine.
When Matt was making his debut as the War Machine, in the first match of the feud, it was against JBL.
JBL performed a vicious looking move that almost tore War Machine's arm off.
But like the Brick mentioned above, Matt took to it very well and took it to JBL!
In this match, Matt used many different types of weapons.
Some of the weapons he used were a baseball bat, some brass knuckles, a shovel, and he also got the crowd going by throwing his crutches into the ring.
Afterwards, JBL got the idea to attack Matt from behind, with an illegal weapon of his own.
His weapon of choice was a hockey stick, a piece of wood.
War Machine got the better of JBL with his weapon, and was finally able to pin him.
He then announced that he was retiring from professional wrestling.
It was then revealed that War Machine, in reality, was an actor named Eric Lomax.
So that was the end of the rivalry between War Machine and JBL, even though JBL tried to get War Machine to come out of retirement.
At some point later on, Brick was back.
And as soon as he made his return to the WWE, he found himself in a program with Rikishi.
The two started out by locking up with each other, but Rikishi took the advantage and hit the Camel Clutch on Brick, giving him a victory via pinfall.
The WWE crowd loved it, and they also loved Rikishi at that point.
As a result, the crowd kept cheering for Rikishi, making it more difficult for Brick to get a match.
Afterwords, the feud was pushed forward with the two having numerous battles that took place around the world.
So it wasn't long before this feud turned into an interesting tag team rivalry.
Rikishi was no doubt winning all the matches, but Brick showed that he was not afraid of his opponents.
Rikishi finally lost to Brick in the most unusual way.
Rikishi picked up a garbage can, and was ready to deliver the final blow to Brick.
However, Brick was able to surprise him.
Brick picked up a garbage can, and they fought back and forth until Rikishi made the final move.
He hit Brick with a garbage can, but instead of going through the mat, it sent Brick flying!
A garbage can like that really hurt Brick's body.
He was actually knocked out, but he managed to recover after about ten minutes, and the match continued on.
At the end of the match, Brick was pinned, and after the match Rikishi was eliminated.
However, it had been over 6 months since that match.
The crowd wanted more action, so a new tag team was created for the show.
This time, there was two different teams instead of three.
It was three teams facing off against each other.
It was all about new stars coming to the spotlight, and getting even better matchups.
The first team was The New Age Outlaws, which is Shawn Michaels and Road Dogg.
The other two members of the team were Billy Gunn and Chyna.
In the first match of the team, they faced off against the team of Goldust and Sunny.
Shawn and Road Dogg began to feud with Sunny and Goldust.
Sunny threw Chyna into Shawn in the corner of the ring, and she got a back-breaker from Chyna.
However, Chyna turned out to be the only one in this team who wasn't able to beat her opponent.
As soon as this match was over, another tag team was announced.
This time, it was The Hardy Boyz.
And they were teamed up with D-X, which was made up of the former members of 3DO, and D-Von Dudley.
The two teams faced off against each other.
The Hardy Boyz were going to use their trademark moves on the challengers.
Billy Gunn decided to use one of them, and it was the piledriver.
He hit Billy Hardy with it, and pinned him for the victory.
Sunny did not get any rest on this show either, she got to see Rikishi in his first match against Edge.
Edge went to attack Rikishi, but got hit in the chest by a kick from him.
However, it was all Edge's fault that this happened.
After that, he tried to finish him off with the ring bell, but Rikishi used his back and threw it off.
With the ring bell off his waist, Rikishi pinned him with his knee.
After a match, there were five members of the tag teams left, four teams and one wrestler.
They decided to end this segment with a big and interesting match.
Four tag teams faced off against each other.
The four tag teams were all teams.
The teams consisted of:
RVD, Christian, and Edge, a team consisting of Chris Jericho, The Hurricane, and Carlito.
The final team was the same team that defeated Brick in his last outing.
The final team was The Dudley Boyz, now with D-Von and Rikishi.
So they were all going to compete for one thing, the Tag Team Championship.
But the big question was, who were going to win the match?
In the end, the wrestling community saw that it would be The Dudley Boyz who would win, not only because they were the old veterans, but they had managed to bring the match to its finale by themselves.
That's it for another week of the ''Top 5 Wrestlers'' in the ''What Really Happened?'' series.
