The goal is to raise $10 million by the end of this year.

The funds we receive through corporate sponsorships, community events, and the IWF are distributed across our network of over 100 programs and services.

We fund programs designed to improve the long term, holistic health and well being of children, youth, women, and families, with a focus on social, emotional, educational, cultural, behavioral, and physical development.

Our work is built around the idea of nurturing relationships and enhancing well being through access to affordable and quality health care, education, arts and cultural enrichment, and social services. This is done within the context of a holistic healthy community approach.

A key initiative of IWF is to facilitate partnerships with community based organizations, so that we can be a resource for them. Our goal is to raise awareness of our work and help them get access to funding sources.

In addition to our public programs and events, we also conduct one to one consultations for select individuals and groups.

About Me

My name is Cindy Butcher. I am a social entrepreneur based out of New York City. I have founded four social enterprises and a philanthropic organization in the areas of education, housing, women empowerment, and economic development. I have provided leadership, support, and financing in the development of each of these initiatives. In my personal life, I have led the United Nations Foundation, WE ARE Family Foundation, and a number of nonprofit organizations as a founder, board member, and leader.

With a foundation in international development, I have led a number of international organizations that promote economic growth and provide relief in areas affected by natural disasters and political instability. I have also worked closely with community based organizations in New York City to develop innovative solutions to meet pressing social needs in the most economically and ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Manhattan. I have served as a senior lecturer in the School of International Relations at China's Fudan University. In addition to business and philanthropic pursuits, I teach women's self development programs in various contexts through my business. This includes facilitating workshops through the United Nations Foundation, corporate retreats for business executives and nonprofits, and consulting for Fortune 500 companies on leadership and personal growth.

In addition to my work as a social entrepreneur, I have published books on women's empowerment and self development, and I am currently writing a book about the intersection of business and philanthropy.

As an African American female, my experiences have provided me with a unique platform from which to conduct research on racism, racial discrimination and its effects, and the development of race-related social entrepreneurial efforts. In doing so, I have launched a number of new initiatives. These initiatives include a social enterprise dedicated to encouraging minority youths to pursue higher education and leadership positions in the financial industry. In addition, I am developing various programs in which I will promote the concept of racial harmony, help foster cross-cultural understanding and cooperation among diverse populations, provide youth with life lessons in business and leadership, support the development of racial unity among minority populations, develop the concept of cultural competence among minority youths, provide educational opportunities and opportunities for racial healing, implement creative programming for community enrichment and cultural advancement, and provide support for under-served minority populations in a variety of settings. I am dedicated to improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people in our diverse communities by providing access to opportunities and resources in a safe, productive, and harmonious environment.

The United Nations Foundation is the United Nations' public advocacy arm, raising global awareness and understanding of the UN's mission to achieve peace, development, and human rights for all people. The United Nations Foundation also champions these goals through UN.org, the official information portal of the United Nations. For more information, please visit www.wearefamilyfoundation.org.

As a professional speaker, I have conducted seminars and workshops at Fortune 500 companies and academic institutions. I have lectured extensively on the topics of effective leadership, executive and managerial effectiveness, communications, management development, and self-development. I have served as an executive coach to senior government officials, leading to the launch of a host of new programs within the United Nations. In addition, I have delivered keynote addresses at Fortune 500 companies, financial institutions, universities, community colleges, non-profit and women's organizations.

In recent years, I have emerged as one of the leading women's empowerment spokespersons, lecturing at colleges and universities around the country on leadership skills, management, and self development. I have conducted workshops at high schools and universities on leadership, diversity management, communication, personal development and finance. In the realm of finance and investments, I have spoken to financial advisors, mutual fund companies, banks and corporations about management skills, financial planning and wealth creation. I am also a contributor for USA Today, Huffington Post and FOX Television.

I am currently working on a book about the intersection of business and philanthropy, and I have written articles for The Global Journal, a publication from the World Health Organization. My writings have appeared in The New York Times, Huffington Post, Businessweek, The Black Star News, FOX Television, ABC Radio News, FOX 25 News, and WNJ Radio. In addition, I conduct numerous interviews for television and radio programs, and I have written for The Associated Press and the New York Times Syndicate.

A native of New York City, I am a graduate of Harlem Community College and the University of South Carolina. I am an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, Inc., where I hold the office of National President for Region II. I currently serve on the advisory board of the City's Economic Development Corporation, the Board of Directors of the Harlem Hospital Center, the Board of Directors of the New York Chapter of the American Red Cross, and as a Past Chair of the United Nations Day Foundation. I serve on the Board of Trustees of the New York Women's Foundation, the United Way of New York City, the New York Community Trust and the New York United Way.

I am married to Dr. Michael L. Butcher. We have been married for 16 years and have two children: Avery & Amara.
