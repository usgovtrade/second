This is one of the first "real" heavy metal songs on record, and with all the horror movie imagery the song has earned itself a large cult following. The album was re-released in 1991 with revised artwork and a different running order.

With "Hell... What Have You Become?" Slayer have finally emerged from the black metal stigma and into the mainstream, gaining huge sales and commercial success. The fact that they are signed to Interscope Records is also not lost on them; the label's roster includes several major bands of the 1990s. The band is touring in support of their latest album, selling out large venues everywhere. The band is expected to go even further with their new sound, which will include more synthesizers and a less grinding tone.

The band have already announced that they have begun work on the follow up to their latest album. In the press conference they have stated "We have some radical plans in store, and are currently working on plans to shock people. We are thinking big and we intend to do it."

The name of the album will not be "Repentless", but they are remaining tight lipped as to what it will be. The band is also expected to perform more live shows in support of the release, particularly outside the US. They have expressed interest in playing shows in Mexico, Europe, South America and Australia. As for their US shows, they are expected to perform at larger arenas including Madison Square Garden and The Universal Amphitheater.

Slayer has always attracted a good amount of media attention. Much of it has been in the form of negative press, including constant criticism about the band's lyrical content and attitude. However, Slayer have now broken through this barrier to prove the critics wrong. They have managed to rise above the controversy and focus on making their music the best it can be. The question that remains to be answered is whether Slayer will have a third album or if they have reached the pinnacle of their career. The only way to find out is to wait for "Repentless".

A place for my ramblings and also some useful stuff

About Me

Well hello there. I'm Alun, a Welsh lad by birth, a geordie by accident and now a Bristolian by choice.

I am half of the Bristol Mourning Personalty. Some know me as "The Professor", they have a good memory.

I have two beautiful daughters, and an amazing Wife, my heart is often full to the brim, I am the luckiest guy in the world, love really is the answer, I'm also a drummer.

I post here on a variety of subjects, and believe me they all will be brought to life with colour, wit and humour.

I'm also in the throes of launching my own new business, called "The Colouring Co.", teaching people how to make their own cards, banners and more. We are launching late Feb 2017, so please do join us on the launch when we are up and running.

Check me out on Twitter @thecolouringco or drop me an email colouringco@live.co.uk or go the website www.thecolouringco.com where I will soon have a blog up and running too

Enjoy the colour and wit, if not, feel free to stab me on the guts, I'm sure the pain will be mutual.

Thanks for visiting my page!
