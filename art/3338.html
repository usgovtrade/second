This video shows you the best and easiest way to learn new words. At the same time, this method makes you a faster and more accurate speller. We have put together 100s of spelling flash cards to practice spelling English words. Each card has the spelling on one side and the meaning on the other side, so you will be able to both learn to spell the word and also understand it at the same time. This is a much more effective way of learning than cramming words into your head one after another. The key to effective learning is practicing with spaced repetition. To achieve this, you need to learn words one day, then review them the next day with a different card. The entire vocabulary is repeated many times to make sure that you can actually remember what you have learnt.
In addition to being a great spelling method, these cards can be used for a lot of other topics, not just English. All of the words can be used for a multitude of different languages and the words are of course always useful for reading and writing.
▶︎ You can download these videos in your phone to practice while you are on the move.
▶︎ You can watch them in your pc to practice in your spare time.
▶︎ You can practice anywhere using this method.

Hi, I'm Alys. I'd like to thank you for being a part of JapanesePod101, and congratulate you for being here to learn Japanese with me.
I'm very excited to introduce to you all what Japanese culture is like in terms of customs, food, and other aspects. We'll start with food. The Japanese diet is very simple. The staple meal for most Japanese people is rice. It might seem basic, but that is quite an accomplishment in itself. You can eat rice a few different ways -- with an assortment of fish, meat, seafood, and vegetables, it's a very tasty diet full of nutritious foods. We eat with chopsticks and a rice bowl. I'll show you how to eat rice properly, and how you can scoop rice into your mouth.
After a good meal, the traditional drink is green tea. It's very simple to make. Now, in terms of customs, the most noticeable one is bowing. When you meet someone you don't know very well, you will often bow to greet them, as a sign of respect. Another custom is wearing the shoes inside out. Well, you're probably wondering, why do they do that? We see shoes in pairs, right? But for some Japanese people, they do not do that. It's a sign of respect for those that wear them. The way you put on your shoes is the same as showing off your socks. You're wearing your socks out. This is a similar thing for shoes. Another cultural practice that may confuse you is the Japanese saying "soshoku-sama" (or "soshoku-san"). It means "thank you" or "you're welcome". The expression is very polite. So polite, in fact, that if you think about using "excuse me," "thanks," or "you're welcome," you will be much better off saying "soshoku-sama." Also, remember, it's OK to say thank you.
Japanese culture is very traditional and different from most other places. I hope this information has been helpful to you, and I hope you will join me again soon for more videos and tips. See you soon!
