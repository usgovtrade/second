the best in American
grubâ€”whether that be burgers, sandwiches, 
salads or tasty sides. 
All meals are prepared fresh, 
locally by an old fashioned family bar and grill, in the same family 
for over 65 years.
It offers American classics with a twist. 
There is something about a well made BLT, 
that's hard to resist. 
Come and grab a beer with friends and enjoy!
When we're not busy catering 
hospitality events, 
we're in the restaurant every day making sandwiches 
and soups. 
Evenings
we hold our classes and have a cook-off. 
I'm very excited about the future for our class. 
We have a few students that have come in and really made us take notice.
For me, this is an integral part of what I love to do: 
teaching, showing people how to be 
creative with food. 
This is the reason we started cooking.
For us it's about providing a new experience 
through food and taking our students 
on an exciting journey in a fun environment.
We're a small class 
so it's pretty intimate and personal.
I've always been taught to respect other people, 
and as a chef to always put people first, 
like I would always want somebody to come in my restaurant and want 
to have a great experience.
This is not just an ordinary food school. 
It's a very experiential learning 
experience that you get.
You can join our course 
which is two days and two 
four hour long classes. 
It's a whole different way of cooking 
and eating.
We are a 
family, a team, 
a bunch of big kids
and a very fun place. 
We want everyone to be able 
to experience this place.
The students will 
learn the fundamentals, 
with the basics of the art of 
grilling; also, 
the basics of food prep 
and seasoning. 
By the end of the course, 
you are going to master 
two recipes that you will bring with you 
in the second phase of your cooking adventure, 
which is when you bring your new found skills 
and knowledge and experience into the kitchen 
of your home.
The reason why we started cooking and creating videos 
was because we wanted to share our food 
and create an avenue for people to get together. 
Through the recipes that we have created 
we share what we do and how we started. 
We take people on a journey and experience
with us every step of the way. 
There are challenges and there are hardships 
and what I think is one of the great things about this, 
is if you can make it through two 
four hour classes,
you can make it through anything, 
including life.
This isn't about cooking for health; this 
is about a fun way to start cooking 
and make healthy meals that are made from scratch.
I've lived through some great times, 
great places. 
I've lived in the best of times, and 
some of the worst, and 
I've always survived.
You can find some great videos of recipes 
we have made on our website. 
I think that one of the things we do 
and I have to say is really special to me 
and one of the most exciting things about it 
is that this is a family operation.
It started with my grandma, 
my mom and my sister and today it's all of us.
It's all hands on deck.
This is something that's been in our blood 
for so long. 
It is important to keep it going,
and also to pass it along.
We continue to teach our students because 
we want to show them a 
good experience, 
and that they are going to have a lot of fun, 
and hopefully, it will help them 
understand a little bit more about 
what we do.
This is something we take very seriously.
People have a lot of questions 
about it. 
They can come and visit us and we are very, 
very open to that, and they can come and sit 
down in our restaurant and try the food. 
We love to show people.
The things that we want to show, are 
the cooking tools, we want them to see 
the way we prepare our food.
The things that we can show them are 
our techniques, what we do, 
how we do things.
This way people can see what we do, 
but we want to keep it real.
We want people to understand that a cooking class 
is a lot more than just cooking food.
It's giving a chance to learn about 
how to enjoy food, 
and how to learn something that is very important to us, 
and that's hospitality.
I'm really excited about the future and 
the things that I'm going to create.
Our students are a reflection of 
their experiences here at the farm 
with us.
That has helped them 
grow tremendously in the kitchen, 
and has inspired me to come to the dinner table.
To me, this is about a way 
for people to learn 
to create a culture of good food, good 
hospitality, and 
to come together as a community. 
If you really want to cook for the future, 
don't take this away from this time, this culture, 
this time, these recipes.
This is really important 
because, as I said, this is really about 
sharing our vision, 
because this is really about how to cook.
We all come together as a family to feed each other, 
and it's just really important that people 
understand the roots of hospitality.
I learned that hospitality is about sharing a story. 
It's not a business. 
It's something that makes us all human.
I think that was really 
the essence of hospitality, 
of those first classes when we were kids.
It's sharing the story.
This is just another part of the story 
that we want to share. 
Thank you all for being here. 
Thank you all for being our family. 
Thanks for being our teachers.
I love what I do and I'm very, very happy 
that people are being introduced 
to our farm through this school.
Every day we cook because it makes us happy. 
It's really about hospitality 
and everything we've been teaching, 
we were taught by our grandmothers. 
Those are our teachers. 
And we have to keep passing on 
the traditions from that generation. 
Hopefully, a new generation will follow.
Thank you all. 
We hope you all can come down to see us. 
We are here to do our thing, 
and I'm very grateful 
for everything that we've been able to create. 
Thank you all.
