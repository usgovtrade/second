"That's it." "What else you got in there?" "That's just a little thing I do to get the sand out." "But it ain't got no teeth." "What do you want for Christmas?" "About this big." "Hey, you don't have to give me anything." "Okay, back you go." "Don't get your wings, I'll trade ya for your nose and your fingers." "Yeah." "Thanks for the nose." "Don't sneeze, we're out of here." "Get the hell off of me." "When I say run, you run!" "Let's go!" "Okay, who's left?" "Let's see." "Who's left?" "Oh, man, damn this whole thing." "Who's left?" "Well, that works out great for me." "I guess it's not bad being the only one left on the team." "Let's play some football." "Let's do it." "What are we gonna play with?" "Your leg, what else?" "That's just sick." "Let's see." "I could use a wing." "That looks pretty good." "How do you do it?" "What do you mean?" "I saw you take that gun apart like it was nothing." "What're you, a mechanic or something?" "Are you a criminal or something?" "Yeah, you know, just kind of." "Sorry, I was just trying to keep the light off of me." "But I would like to come over to your house and be your friend." "Yeah, I bet you would." "You bet I would." "Shit." "This looks like my ex-girlfriend's house." "You're kidding." "Hey, I don't want you to take any guff off of him." "I should kick your ass." "I lost a lot of people in this, jackass." "Now I have to lose you." "I said, get down!" "Don't get comfortable." "I got him!" "What do you mean?" "Hi." "Oh, my God, it's her." "And her, and her." "Hi." "It's her, look." "I must be really stoned." "Hi." "Oh, don't mind me, I'm just tagging along." "Oh, my God." "It's them!" "Run, don't look back." "I can't help it!" "Look, you guys, it's the guys that think that I'm stealing the hubcaps." "We got everybody in this house!" "Hey, I'll get you!" "You're dead meat!" "Come here, you son of a bitch!" "Come here." "Hey, what do I do with this?" "You're gonna kill him!" "You're gonna kill him!" "You're gonna kill him!" "Come on, kill him!" "I don't think there's anything wrong with your TV set, Ma." "Mom, it's the guys from the garage." "They wanna come up and play." "All right." "Hey, listen, just don't go back there okay?" "We have got enough trouble and I don't need you getting hurt." "No trouble, Mom." "No trouble." "How's it going?" "I'm taking off, buddy." "Okay, great." "Come on up and play." "Yeah, Mom." "Bring your friend." "Come on." "May I use your bathroom?" " Sure." " Go upstairs, second door on the right." "This is my friend Steve." "We were just having a little chat." "What the hell's going on?" "Will you tell me what the hell's going on?" " I don't wanna hear that shit in my house!" " What are you doing here?" "I'm having a chat with the lady of the house and her son, and I feel safer already." "I'm sorry about this." "He's not sorry." "He's just stupid!" "I love you guys, but he just drives me crazy!" "Well, listen, I better get going." "You having your own party?" "Bye, Rach!" "Bye!" "You wanna know why the TV went on the fritz?" " No." " Yeah, I know who broke the TV." "It wasn't just the TV." "They screwed up the antenna and the cable." "They don't deserve to get away with it." "Oh, you go back there, you might as well kiss the TV good night." "Wait a minute, that's a good idea." " Why don't you kiss them?" " Get them outta here!" "Yeah, get them outta here!" "Let's get outta here." "Wait a minute, wait a minute!" "We all want it!" "I know what we do, when we're done we all stick together." "I'm in, man!" "It was close enough to kiss your butt good-bye." "I'm in, okay?" "My friend!" "That's it for you, buddy." "Hey, come here, you!" "Hey!" "Hey!" "This was your stupid plan, you putz." "I'll see you guys." "I'm going up here." "You guys do this a lot?" "I'll see you later." "Yeah, yeah, wait, before you go!" "Oh, man!" "Get the ball rolling?" "Can we sing some more of that crap?" "That was unbelievable." "What the hell?" "Who was the voice?" "Lunch is ready, everyone!" "Lunch is ready!" "Hey, wait up!" "Wait for me!" "Wait up!" "Wait for me!" "Wait!" "Hold it!" "Hey, buddy!" "Hey, look out!" "Come on, get out of here!" "Oh, God!" "Help me!" "Jesus Christ!" "Hey, what are you doing?" "Hey, he's down there." "What the hell?" "He's hurt." "We got to go get him." "Damn!" "Damn!" "I knew you were lying." "You think I'm lying?" "Hey, I told you I heard glass break." "It was a lousy window." "I couldn't get out of the garage." "There was no light on..." "The light was on." "There's nothing we can do to him now." "Why don't we make sure he doesn't get hurt anymore." "What're you talking about?" "Why don't we tie him up?" "There's no way to tie him up." "He's too tall." "We'll make him fall down." "Tie him up." "Come on." "I don't want to die!" "Oh, man!" "This son of a bitch is heavy!" "God!" "Son of a bitch!" "Oh, shit." "Don't give me any shit now, okay?" "I'm just as worried about you as you are about me." "Is there a phone around here?" " You, you're not going anywhere." " Yes, I am." "He's tied up like a pig over there and he needs help." "Don't even think about it." "Listen, I'll make a deal with you, okay?" "I will untie him, you say you are not gonna call anybody." "Okay, forget it." "You're going over there and kill him!" "Now, look, I know you're scared, but we can get out of here." "We can hide out and wait for somebody to come along." "I can't move." "I can't move." "They will not believe me." "They will not believe me." "I will never get away with it." "I will never get away with it." "God, they're here already!" "They're here already!" "Oh, God, no!" "No!" "He took the battery out." "He took the battery out." "You're right, he's going to ruin the engine." "He's going to ruin the engine." "He's going to ruin the engine." "Take a look at the fuel gauge." "See if there's any." "Hey, he's gone." "No, he's not." "He's hiding behind that truck." "Look, look!" "The light's still on." "The light's still on!" "Okay." "We got to pull it together and get some plan together, okay?" "We got to think, here." "Think!" "All right, we got one shot." "Let's use it." "We got to use that gun." "We'll be better off shooting from here, behind something." "We're not going to outrun him." "At least from here, we got a chance." "If we're going to go out there and shoot him, then I want to go out there." "He's not going to make it." "No, he's not going to make it." "We'll give him a head start, but he's not going to make it, but he's not going to make it!" "He's dead." "He's dead already." "I'm ready." "I'm ready!" "Let's go." "All right, on the count of three, we're going out there." "And don't run out in front of me." "And I mean don't run out in front of me, okay?" "Okay?" "All right?"
