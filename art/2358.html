“Tonight, we make our move. We must unite or the darkness wins, this city will be lost.”

These words have echoed through the city for centuries. And tonight, they will resonate once more. There are forces that seek to tear Aphrodite apart. A dark force that has been re-awakened, with one goal. To bring about the downfall of Aphrodite, and with it, all of civilization.

Torn between the lure of darkness and the light, two factions. Each with their own agenda. Both seeking out the same target. The target? The Loom. An ancient artifact. It could be the key to uniting the two factions, and ending the war for good. Or, it could serve as the end of all.

“For the darkness to truly end, these hands must meet.”

But, what is the Loom? What will happen when they do? There are answers within Aphrodite, deep in the dark corners of her streets. Within her darkest, most devious of nightclubs. At The Loom. But will what they discover be enough to stop the tide of darkness?

“The darkness is winning. It always has.”

And when the darkness is defeated, will a city be saved or lost?

About the Author: I'm a writer and musician from Canada.

The Loom Preview

The Loom Preview

In the shadow of a building, we meet a man and woman. The man, our protagonist. He is a former thief with the power to manipulate light. He uses this power to steal from the wealthy, who seek his abilities to help protect their homes. He is looking for a friend, a woman who can use light to heal his injured side.

He tracks her to a nightclub on Aphrodite. At the Loom. This nightclub is the meeting place for two factions. Each with their own agenda. The factions are the forces of darkness and light. He meets the woman at the nightclub where they share their stories, and a bond is forged.

Soon, it becomes clear to him that these are the factions seeking the light and the hidden truth within the Loom. He makes a deal with the woman, a deal that ultimately brings both her and the Loom into the dark corner of Aphrodite.

The Loom is released once a month, every other Monday, by Aphrodite Comics. The first few pages are now available for preview through the Kickstarter link on this page.

We will be releasing a preview every week, until release day. Make sure you are signed up for email notifications on the site, and follow our social media accounts for the most up-to-date information about the Kickstarter and release schedule.

The Loom Kickstarter

The Loom is launching in less than a week! Our Kickstarter campaign will run from May 10th through to June 5th.

The Loom, the first release in The Great Unified Darkness. We had been planning to do a large Kickstarter campaign for The Loom, but as we've gotten closer to releasing the comic, we realized that the Kickstarter budget wasn't enough. With a $2.00 Kickstarter per release, we would have to put out our entire publishing budget for The Great Unified Darkness on each release.

Aphrodite Comics’ finances can only support our current release schedule through a small amount of donations. But don't worry, if you can't contribute, don't worry! We will keep doing what we do best; publish comics, with the launch of The Loom.

If you aren't able to donate, you can still help spread the word about our campaign through sharing and liking on your social media. Even a simple Like or Retweet will help, and we want to thank you for taking a minute to support our work.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:23
