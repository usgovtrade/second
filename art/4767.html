2. Description of the Prior Art
Electrodynamics is the study of electromagnetic fields in material media, especially electric and magnetic fields. Historically, however, materials were studied principally in connection with the propagation of waves of mechanical force through the material media. Thus a distinction was made between the mechanical nature of the mechanical waves and the material property of the material media. However, it is well known that a mechanical wave can be transformed into a set of electric and magnetic fields or vice versa through electromagnetic transduction wherein a mechanical change is converted into an electric field through the application of an electric potential (E), or alternatively an electric field is produced through the application of mechanical work. The converse also is possible wherein an electric potential (E) or a magnetic field is converted into a mechanical force, or mechanical work is converted into an electric field. Through such electrodynamic transduction, acoustic signals can be transformed into electrical signals and vice versa. The converse also is true and electrodynamic transduction can be employed to transfer electrical energy into acoustic signals or acoustic signals into electrical energy.
Accordingly, electrodynamic transduction can be employed to transmit information signals by acoustic signals where the medium through which the acoustic signals are transmitted has a high or low resistivity. In addition, the acoustic signals are transformed into electrical signals or electrical signals are transformed into acoustic signals.
Where the medium through which the acoustic signal is transmitted is gas or a vacuum, electrodynamic transduction can be employed to transfer the energy of a beam of electrons or photons into mechanical motion. The acoustic wave produced by the motion of the electrons or photons is transformed into a modulated current by means of suitable transducers. In a similar manner, ultrasonic signals or sound signals can be transmitted through the atmosphere by the use of an electromagnetic field produced by an electric current in an antenna. The acoustic waves received by the antenna are transformed into an electrical signal. In this fashion, information can be conveyed over a distance of several hundred meters by electrodynamic transduction.
Transducers convert between the electrical signals of an information-carrying medium and the acoustic signals of the transmitting medium. The transfer of energy between the two forms of energy is an electromagnetic process. In most cases, electric and magnetic fields must pass through an interface region between the transducer and the media when the transducer acts as a transmitter or when it converts acoustic or electromagnetic waves into electric or magnetic fields. The field configuration of the transducer and the dielectric properties of the two media determine the electric and magnetic field intensities and their relative phases at the interface. Since this transfer of energy is effected through an interface region, the energy is substantially decreased as it is transferred across the interface. A reduction in the power of acoustic or electrical signals propagated through a medium requires a transducer which transfers energy from the first to the second form with a relatively low loss in the acoustic or electrical signal power.
The energy losses that are caused by the transducer are inversely related to the efficiency of the transfer of energy from one form to another. A transducer with a relatively low efficiency results in a high loss in the transfer of energy. A transducer which operates at the lower limits of the acceptable level for acceptable acoustic or electrical power output has an efficiency of about 90%. To the extent that the transfer of energy from one form to another is not 100% efficient, a part of the incident energy is reflected at the interface between the transducer and the transmitting medium. Since a very small portion of the emitted acoustic or electric signal energy is usually reflected back into the transmitting medium, the reflected energy interferes with the acoustic or electric signals of the same wavelength and causes noise. This effect is generally referred to as internal noise and results from an undesired transmission of signals within the body of the transducer at a frequency equal to one or more of its natural modes of vibration. A simple analysis of energy conservation and the principle of superposition of waves can be used to show that a single point source or the equivalent electrical model of a single point source produces a standing wave pattern with a node at its origin. Such a model may describe a simple case of a bar of a homogeneous material of infinite size.
Since one can predict the modes and nodal positions of these transducers by analysis, one can design a transducer so that it will operate at or near a nodal position, thus minimizing the internal noise and, at the same time, reducing the effects of reflection at the interface between the transducer and the transmitting medium.
As discussed in chapter 3 of the book "Electrodynamics" by David J. Griffiths (second edition), 1971, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., publishers, New York, N.Y., a dipole antenna is characterized by its length, by the distance between its end nodes or elements, by the electrical and magnetic characteristics of its elements and by the direction of the electrical field at its terminal nodes. When the dipole is operated in a medium of relatively low conductivity, such as a vacuum or in a gas, the current in each element of the dipole is in phase and, consequently, the electrical field is uniform throughout the element and a large electrical field exists at the end nodes. If, however, the dipole is operated in a medium of relatively high conductivity, such as a good conductor, the current in each element is not in phase with the voltage across it. This results in a phase difference between the two and an electric field is established at one of the nodes. Since, however, the electric field in the conductor is in the same direction as the current, an abrupt step exists between areas of a small electric field at one of the nodes and a large electric field at the other node. This step can serve to reflect energy back into the conductor by either the antenna or by any other object with which it may be coupled at the interface between them.
Another source of loss in the transfer of energy is the fringing fields which develop between the active transducer elements and the body of the transducer. The fringing fields may be substantially reduced by the use of a relatively thin strip conductor with a surface resistivity of one to ten ohms per square as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 3,747,016.
With the above described considerations in mind, the efficiency of a transducer can be increased by using a medium which permits a uniform distribution of the electrical and magnetic fields across the active elements of the transducer, by reducing the size of the effective element and increasing its number so that the dipole or array is more efficient. This can be accomplished by the use of thin film techniques. For example, thin film transducers have been proposed using ceramic materials for the piezoelectric ceramic transducers. Other thin film devices have been fabricated from materials such as thin molybdenum, tungsten and the like which have high mechanical strength and good thermal conductivity and thus are suitable for use in a wide variety of environments, especially high temperature and high vacuum. Further, the thin film devices are formed of a relatively uniform distribution of materials and thickness and are less expensive to produce than transducer assemblies formed from a plurality of discrete elements. However, thin film piezoelectric transducer arrays may have drawbacks with regard to the acoustic power and the output signal as compared to other arrays, especially when such devices are employed in high power devices or systems.
The performance of a transducer depends upon the material constants such as dielectric constant, loss tangent, elastic stiffness and the like. These parameters of the material vary with temperature and time during operation, and this may be a disadvantage in high power devices.
While many transducer assemblies are formed of a combination of one or more solid ceramic materials and one or more adhesive materials, it is not a simple matter to achieve the required strength and flexibility for many transducer assembly applications. A specific example is the so-called "smart structures" which include an array of ceramic elements having transducer capability and an interconnection circuitry in an integral form to provide a combined structure which may then be employed as an antenna or electrical or optical input transducer, or a mechanical sensor.
One of the common problems in the design of an efficient, high power transducer is how to attach the various elements of a ceramic transducer array to the surrounding members without introducing undesirable resonant modes in the system. For example, when a ceramic transducer array is attached to a cylindrical metallic ferrule of an RF or microwave waveguide, a difficulty is encountered because the ceramic material has a large dielectric constant, and the cylindrical ferrule has a relatively small dielectric constant and a small dielectric loss tangent. This results in a spurious cavity resonance at some frequencies which causes significant power losses in the transducer.
Many of the aforementioned problems are solved by the arrangement of thin film piezoelectric and electrostrictive elements disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 910,973, filed May 30, 1978, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,198,643. In this application, an electrode structure which includes a first series of electrode portions and a second series of electrode portions is deposited on one surface of a piezoelectric or electrostrictive ceramic body and a plurality of electrical lead connections are printed on the electrode structure. The electrode portions are preferably connected to the lead portions by a series of spaced electrically conductive bumps or fingers which extend from the respective electrode</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:20
