"What are you doing?" "Shh!" "I thought I saw the curtains move." "You saw the curtain move?" "You were smoking marijuana, son?" "Is that what you were doing?" "You got a lighter?" "Uh-uh." "You want to tell me what happened?" "I had a bad dream." "I was falling down a hole and it hurt..." "It's okay." "It's okay." "I got you." "It's okay, it's okay, it's okay." "It's okay."

"I'm going down the hall, to the room with the big fucking hole." "Stop talking about holes!" "He said he was being chased by monsters." "He told you that?" "No." "What happened, Caleb?" "I got left behind at a restaurant..." "and I was going to my car and these things attacked me." "Show me where the things are." "At the restaurant, I saw two men." "Two men?" "They left to follow that man." "They came out of the back room and they attacked me." "Okay, okay, okay." "The man in the dark coat, what did he look like?" "It was dark and..." "Show me." "It was a monster, okay?" "Caleb, you have to be specific." "It was a monster!" " It's important for us to know." " It was a man!" "It wasn't a man, okay?" "It was dark, and it had a-a-a mask and a hat and it had long nails, like claws for fingernails." "He was dirty, I think." "Okay, good." "I don't know why he was there, all right?" "He wasn't supposed to be there!" "He just followed me." "Okay, well, he left you for a reason, all right?" "Why would you leave your car?" "I don't know, I was..." "I don't know what he wants." "Why did he want to hurt you?" "What did he do to you?" "I don't know, all right?" "Why did he leave you there?" "What did you do to him?" "I don't know, I don't know!" "He had a-a-a knife with a big long blade." "Are you sure it was a knife?" "A big long knife, that's what he had." "But the other one, it was a different kind of knife." "What did it look like?" "Can you remember what it looked like?" "I can't remember what it looked like." "Caleb, think hard." "It was a zipper knife." "It was big." "He pulled me in the car." "He pulled me inside..." "Okay, where did he pull you in?" "I was going to the restaurant, I was going to get some dinner." "Caleb, did you get some dinner?" "No." "I got lost in the kitchen." "He pulled me in there." "I..." "What happened?" "I tried to get out, but it was locked from the outside." "Locked from the outside?" "Yeah." "I opened the door, and I went out and I went in the car." "Which door did you go through?" "The kitchen." "All right, Caleb, show me where the kitchen is." "Can you remember, is there anything in the kitchen?" "Yeah, there's a stove, a refrigerator." "Okay, Caleb, do you see a trash can?" "Yeah, a garbage can." "Is there something in the trash can?" "No." "Do you see any paper?" "No, just a-a bucket of water." "Bucket of water?" "Are there any tools?" "Tools?" "I don't know." "Just a-a bucket of water." "Okay." "Hey, maybe we should look in the car for something to eat?" "The fucker took my fucking keys." "You don't remember how you got in the house?" "No." "Okay, all right." "Well, what about other details?" "Did you smell anything?" "Did the man say anything?" "Anything?" "No, he just got me inside." "I never saw him before, I swear." "We're gonna find the man that did this to you, all right?" "Now, look, just take a minute, okay?" "How'd you get the burn on your arm?" "I said I got lost in the kitchen." "Okay." "What about other details?" "You remember anything else?" "Anything at all?" "No, it was dark." "Dark?" "What about outside, when you were walking to the car?" "Did you see anything outside?" "No." "That's good." "The man said something else..." "No, I just need to eat something." "Look, you need anything from the car?" "Your car keys, anything?" "The man, he took them, too." "What happened, Caleb?" "What's going on?" "What's happening?" "I think I should stay with you." "No, I think that you should come with me." "I think I should stay with you." "Okay." "Are you gonna be able to call your mom soon?" "Mmm-hmm." "What are you doing?" "I've got some sleeping pills." "Okay, now, you have to take them all." "They're gonna help you rest." "What's happening?" "You rest, okay?" "We'll see you later, Caleb." "No, I don't want to go to sleep." "I want to see my mom!" "Caleb, we're gonna find her." "They were there!" "That man and that woman, they were there!" "They're looking for me." "They've always been there." "Caleb, calm down." "Okay?" "Take your medicine." "I don't want to take it." "I know." "Just take it." "I don't want to take them." "Okay." "Hey, maybe you should lay down for a while, okay?" "We'll talk some more later, okay?" "Yeah, okay." "What do you mean you've got to find him?" "We've got three other patients." "He's in there somewhere!" "We've gotta find him!" "He's in there!" "We've gotta find him!" "Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?" "The time of what?" "What time is it?" "Okay, I don't have</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:08
