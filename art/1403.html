I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks this way. I am a Christian who plays heavy metal music. Sometimes I do listen to secular music and sometimes I enjoy. I have no problem with the music I listen to being 'out of the box'.

If the author had thought it was important for him to make his point, why didn't he add the word to the end of one of the songs to tell us what they are? After all the song is the only thing that should be needed to get his point across.

I've always wondered why people go on about the 'bad influence' that heavy metal music has on kids. All he did was write that song, the lyrics are just what he imagines them to be. If he wrote a song about a girl having unprotected sex with a man who had AIDS and then had a song about rape the same thing would happen.

That said, I don't think metal music is bad. But I think this video is poorly done. It's all style over substance, which is a common problem.

I love heavy metal as much as the next guy. I think some Christian metal is great (i.e., Stryper, Stryper, Stryper, Stryper).

But as a whole, metal is like pornography: you can call it Christian, but it still involves a sexual act.

One time, I was in a public meeting with a preacher and a deacon. Both of them were speaking against Christianity, so I asked them to tell me what happened to the Christians who lived on the isle of Patmos. They didn't know. Finally I said, "Well, they were obviously bad Christians." The preacher stood up and took off his jacket. He was wearing a T-shirt that said, "I Love Satan."

This reminds me of the one time I was caught going to the wrong music on a college campus, but was able to explain myself and it wasn't a big deal.

You and the guy that made this video have something in common: You seem ignorant and your approach seems condescending. Yes, Christian rock has nothing to do with anything but just sounds Christian.

I am sorry that it seems obvious that a person with no knowledge of my life is trying to imply that I am "ignorant" because my personal taste in music is what it is. There is absolutely nothing wrong with listening to music that has Christian lyrics...as long as it does not dictate how you live your life.

I think if you have done any extensive research on the true teachings of Jesus Christ then you would see that if Jesus walked on earth today, he would have to be living in a heavily populated area in the south. What he'd have to be saying to those on the north side of the city would be drastically different.

You are being way to simplistic in your thoughts...not to mention, you are being very presumptive in your claims that just because I say certain songs (whether through lyrics or sound) are "bad" or "not Christian" that I am either not Christian or ignorant of the Bible.

As for the "ignorant" comment on my comments about not using knowledge of the Bible to determine if the music is or is not good...then how do you know that you "are ignorant?" And just what "knowledge of the Bible" are you referring to? Who wrote the Bible? Just because I have not taken the time to thoroughly research every word every person in every story and every person says something in the bible doesn't make me ignorant of the Bible. You and I are using the Bible as our "bible" and as one who is a Christian who follows the teachings and words of Jesus Christ, what I consider good music or not is simply because of my personal tastes in music.

If I am wrong in my stance in this article I will admit it...but since you are clearly not a scholar of any sort, then I do not expect you to be able to make this claim or judgment of me.

"He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him" (John 3:36 KJV)

God does not save on other standards but mine.I did not make them either, I would recommend reading some of his comments (most probably from "Christian" articles)

John 3:36-37 I guess you missed the last part of the verse, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

You are not saved by your beliefs, you are saved by Faith in Christ, it is something that you can not have.God, who is omniscient, can not be seen by mortal man because he is incomprehensible and He can not be contained in any vessel or by man. The only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ.He alone saved you from your sins, if you believe. The only way to live your life as a christian is to live a virtuous one, there's no amount of music or lifestyle that can save you, except what Jesus himself did.

I hate to ruin your whole song and video with this comment...but this is pretty much what you're saying...and it is not true!

If a person believes that God is real, and they are saved, then they will believe that Jesus died for their sins and he is the only way to heaven. They will believe that they must go to church and get baptized on a regular basis, that they must give of their time to helping the needy.

That is what it means to be a Christian! And then, no matter what type of music they listen to or what type of lifestyles they choose, they will live a good life because they want to... not because they have to.

You have a message that you want to give out and since it is of God, it is good to share. I do not understand what the message is, but I do know that God has given you a platform to use in order to help others know who he is.

"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad" (2 Cor 5:10).

We read that very same verse in the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians. That is why we know that the Holy Spirit testifies with the spirit of the prophesy in the church.

"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together" (Rom 8:14-17).

"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?" (Mat 7:11).

In addition, we learn from the book of Acts, from the apostles, that they were singing while they were speaking, which is what we call preaching the word. This is where they are preaching what they heard in the house of God, and are giving us the message, which is the word of God. This is a very powerful word to live by.

"Thus, brethren, earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints. " (Jude 1:3). The reason we have to do this, as believers, is because: "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, write thee these things, that they may be remembered in the days which come upon thee, which thou shalt see." (Dn 12:47-49).

We can not add to the word of God, that would destroy the very word of God. He tells us not to do it, but we are warned by Him to not add to or take away from the words of the bible. The Bible is God's word, it is a life manual.

"Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save." (Isa 63:1-2).
