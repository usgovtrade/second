you’re throwing confetti” 
I don’t want to change what
I’m doing on stage. 
I don’t want to change a lot of things 
I don’t want to stop the freedom
that I have on stage 
just to fit into the image that 
I’m trying to portray 
(… ahh!) 
(…I get it.) 
(I’m okay now.)
I want to keep my original style
and try to work
that little bit of freedom in. 
I think people should take risks 
and be brave and… 
don’t worry about what people think.
Don’t be afraid to
make your mistakes and 
change the way you dress
you have to do what you think is right. 
you can’t not do what you feel
your heart saying. 
- 
it’s your body!
your body follows your mind. 
You should do what makes you feel good. 
- 
yeah
You have to live your life
honestly and courageously.
I want to be a person
who’s honest with herself. 
I’m not pretending
I’m not trying to conform to an image. 
I am myself. 
That’s why this is the end
of my second album. 
I put everything in it that
I thought of myself. 
I guess that is why
I’m working hard
to be good in every aspect. 
There’s nothing more important
to me than 
how I feel about myself 
and that I could 
have a big impact on the world.
So I want to get better at all of that
I don’t want to rest until
I get it all together. 
I want to be the kind of person
that never gets frustrated with herself. 
but I’m still a baby
and there’s a lot of things that I want to learn.
- - 
So yeah… 
I just think that they all have 
inspirational words to you. 
- 
I didn’t know that 
you had a very serious mindset. 
- 
We have a lot of
things in common. 
- 
Of course! 
- 
I want to make a promise to you.
I want to make you 
a promise. 
- 
Thank you. 
- 
No. No. 
I’m saying 
that you should continue 
being you. 
(What?) 
I don’t like the way 
this interview is going 
so please promise me that 
you won’t get any plastic surgery. 
(I won’t!) 
Okay?
(So that’s a promise!)
- So?
- So? 
- 
I’m going to tell you 
something. 
- 
Oh, okay. 
- 
Your lips have a lot to be desired. 
You have to stop frowning. 
(What did you say? 
I have to what? 
Ahh...) 
(Okay. 
I’ll do as you say.)
Yes, you have to 
have your lip 
fixed. 
I’ll go to the doctor. 
I hope it will be okay.
Your eyelids should look brighter. 
I don’t really agree with that. 
If they get wrinkled, 
they’ll get wrinkled. 
They’re fine the way they are. 
So do what you want. 
If they’re wrinkled, that’s what they are. 
We don’t like you when you’re wrinkly.
Don’t be a little baby.
You’re a little baby. 
(That’s not what I meant! 
If I ask you a favor, I want 
you to do it for me.)
Yes, it’s obvious that I don’t mean it. 
- I can’t believe 
you asked me to do that. 
- 
I’m doing what you ask. 
You can’t say 
you didn’t do what you’re supposed to. 
I really didn’t do anything. 
- 
When are you going 
to do it? 
- 
(Hurry up. 
I said tomorrow.) 
We’re having 
a little party tomorrow. 
You want to know that 
I’m telling you the truth 
- - 
I’m going to go tell my mother. 
- 
Well, my mother is my family 
I’m talking about a party. 
I’ll meet you tomorrow 
at 
7 P.M. 
At 7 P.M. tomorrow, okay?
That’s good enough. 
I’m going to 
say goodbye. 
- Okay.
Okay.
Thank you. 
- 
I really am, 
more than you know. 
- 
(The promise…)
Okay. 
- You don’t know. 
You want to make a promise?
I’m going to say 
that you should continue 
being you. 
You should keep working 
on what you think is right. 
I want you to be yourself.
Thank you for liking me.
Thank you.
I’m really grateful that I got to 
work with a big group of people.
I was really happy to have my
first two singles come out 
and have my first album 
come out when I was younger. 
I’m really grateful that I had an opportunity 
to work with a new artist like her. 
I think we were the same in the way that 
we want to show the world a different side of ourselves.
Don’t do that.
All right. 
(Thank you. 
I love you.)
(Oh.)

Chinese: 
从第三任
到第一任
是出名商业成功的男演员
演过的电影数量也居高不下
印象非常深刻
他是个丰富的演员
专注于演戏
这也许才是他的真正潜质
能在这些电影中获得这样的成功
是他靠自己的选择才能达到的结果
一定意味着他想多了
对他的演员身份的全部承诺
以及对具体工作的信心
我也想深深地感谢
他们
我也真的很感谢
你们拍了自己的摄影
并且让我拍摄了摄影
拍完最后一个广告时
也有几名角色在这里
我真的很高兴
在这次拍摄中见到了大家
和演员一起拍摄
感觉好像在拍某个节目
感谢你们帮助我真的很蛮感谢
我觉得
其实对他来说
我们的整个这次拍摄
完成以后
应该都是令他高兴的
这次被拍的不仅只是一个演员
