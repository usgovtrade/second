I don’t know how I can thank people for putting up with this performance for so long. I am absolutely shattered.”

There was no need to tell us – we were shattered, too, though not quite in the same way.

The second half was another 90-minute bludgeon to the senses. The only positive in the first half was a superb save from Carly Telford diving low to her left to repel from inside the area a venomous shot from Abbi Grant.

Slightly higher up, another great save by the Chelsea keeper from a deflected shot from Kaila Bunton.

Not until it was 2-0 – and there was only one question anyone was asking.

Two quick goals, first from a deep free-kick from Jodie Taylor, whose shot was parried by Carly. The keeper left it for Alex Greenwood to rifle in from six yards.

Chelsea’s players left the pitch to a chorus of boos from fans. There was no chance of taking it easy here.

And so it went on, only a solitary effort at goal by Abbie Williamson denied the two-goal cushion.

In stoppage time, the game ended. As did our final hopes.

It was a great season to get an insight into the world of women’s football. No shortage of quality, too.

It’s a shame we have to get involved in the relegation battle, but maybe the fact this season is the last gives us an opportunity to really appreciate it, for the players, our fans and their incredible devotion to their beloved club.

If we can get a couple of wins under our belts in this final week, perhaps we can claw back some points and help ourselves in what is quite an extraordinary season.

For me, this has been a year to cherish.

No relegation. Not many games. No injuries. And a team that’s beaten the best teams in Europe. So much of that depends on your luck, and it’s not everyone who has the good fortune to get to see the beautiful game live and up close.

I know we’ve a lot of hard work to do next season, but these things happen, and that’s the truth. Let’s enjoy the moment and forget about that for a while, eh?

This is a season that will live long in the memory.

Next season it will be business as usual. We’ll be looking to go one better this time.

So now we prepare to head to Arsenal for the FA Cup Final, after which we get the season out of our system and move on to bigger and better things.

We go into next season with high hopes. We go into every season with high hopes.

We’ve done it once. There’s only one way to go from here and that’s up!

This is a great football club. Nothing to fear here. You have nothing to fear here. This is the Chelsea I joined last year. They are very, very confident.

And the ones I meet are fantastic people too.

Everyone asks, ‘How do you find the women’s game?’ But for me, it’s always been a bit of a family affair. It’s the family, the club, everything that takes me back to when I was a boy and it all seems to come together.

There are thousands of young fans, many with their own passion. It’s a very positive place to be.

We have to get on with it now. It’s the final day of the season and the work that still needs to be done is immense.

But this team has done enough to deserve promotion to a higher level, and we’ll give it our very best shot.

With only seven games to go we have a lot of work to do over the next four weeks, but what we do will be done with passion.

We know we’re not going to get a lot of rest over the next seven days or so.

We’ll be up and down the country with the players at all our away fixtures, and that will be tough as well.

We will keep all our fingers and toes crossed to be able to enjoy the final, but if not then we’ll enjoy the games while they last.

This is a season where every member of staff on this side of the world-famous white line will cherish this football club and its supporters.

That’s where we all belong. The world needs more football clubs like Chelsea Football Club, and more football clubs like we’re building here.

There will be great days ahead. And when you have a world-class manager at the helm, too, why would anyone doubt that there will be silverware won next season?

There are no concerns at all that we’ll lose the fans.

That’s why we play the game. We need your energy and passion. We’re working very hard to give you the kind of experience that only happens in the top flight of world football.

Next year, though, we are determined to put it all together and make this club what it should be and will be – a shining light on the south coast of England.

In this next league campaign we want to continue to be champions of Europe, so we’ll focus on the day-to-day job of getting the team and our youngsters ready for the year ahead, and hopefully a lot more success on the road.

The fans can enjoy the season they’ve just witnessed. There are already plans to start the work of re-energising and regenerating that wonderful stadium and it will be a great experience for the supporters.

But in this game, football isn’t everything. It’s more than that. It’s the family. It’s about playing football because you love it, and because you love it because you play it.

I grew up loving playing with the greatest of all football managers and coaches, and for the first half of the season I found myself in the old dugout under his guidance.

I think that says it all. I think this all-round football club can be a winner.

I’m a pragmatist and I always look for the evidence to back up my thinking.

Well, I’ve got to say, if you can be a better all-round team than the one we’ve got this season, then I’ll be a very surprised man!

This season, we’ve got to make a step change. We have to take everyone by surprise next season. We need to give the fans great days out, and get the players over the line with a real bang.

A year ago, there were many who wondered whether we’d make it, whether it was even possible.

That’s my belief and that’s what we’ll work towards next season. It would have been hard to imagine last season when it began with a defeat to Arsenal, but the players found their feet and got that job done.

The new players were put to the test, and they got through it.

The girls grew into themselves and took that team to new levels of performance.
