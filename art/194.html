extend the life of your air conditioner 
that will save you tons of money. 
Here's the deal: many homes aren't properly 
ventilated. This means the air that's circulating 
around your home isn't getting the fresh 
air it needs to stay comfortable. 

You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive 
fans to beat the heat. All you need is some 
help from a simple DIY project that's easy 
to do and doesn't even cost that much. 

Before we get started, check to make sure 
your air conditioner is properly ventilated 
by following these steps: 

A. Run the fan in the back of the unit. 

You should have an exhaust pipe at the 
front of the unit so that air can escape 
out of the vents. 

B. Check for an intake pipe. 

In most homes, the intake is located 
next to the front of the unit. 

C. Open your windows and doors. 

Make sure they're fully open so the air 
can circulate around the entire home. 

Now that you've double checked that 
your air conditioner's not getting 
too much air from a single 
vent, let's learn how to extend 
the life of your air conditioner. 

Step 1: Invest in an inexpensive fan. 

One of the easiest ways to make 
sure your air conditioner stays 
comfortable and doesn't break is to 
by increasing the airflow. 

The best and most affordable way to do 
this is with an inexpensive floor fan. 

Step 2: Plug the fan into the wall 

You'll want to buy a plug-in fan, 
which can be found in hardware 
stores or ordered online. 

This fan should be plugged in so 
it can circulate air around the home. 

Step 3: Make sure it's working 

When you turn on the fan, check the 
light to make sure it's working. 

Step 4: Sit back and enjoy the breeze. 

Get out the cold drink you've been 
saving for this moment, and take a 
breather. 

As a bonus, your energy bill will 
get a little bit smaller and your air 
conditioner should last longer.

This year, we are focused on energy efficiency.

If we need to purchase a new a/c system, we would buy a mitsubishi air conditioner unit, instead of another american unit, because we live in a hot and humid climate, we can use the a/c in a much better way than the other a/c.

Our kitchen's a/c is also mitsubishi.

For me, i would opt for this unit again:

Hope this helps,

Good Luck

I have a question regarding that it is said that to cool a room you need .24 cubic feet of air per second per ft2 of surface. How many fans would be required to achive this or is there a cheaper alternative to fans.

You don't know what's the cost? This would cost up to 500 bucks, for a 20X20 room

If you do, it is quite expensive for me. Maybe somebody can suggest a way to cool my A/C. My old A/C is over heating my room.

i think one of the box fans would cool the A/C down, i dont think a box fan would be able to do it, i think one would have to be larger. im a home owner with a 20x20 room and i just use one, its not cool by any means but wouldnt matter how many i used as there so small
