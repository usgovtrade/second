Noisy Loops is a collection of 200 sound loops, covering a wide variety of musical styles and formats, all recorded in 24 bit WAV at a quality of approximately 24 bits. The recordings have been hand selected with a view to achieving a broad spectrum of contemporary and retro styles, suitable for use in videos, games, webpages, multimedia productions or background music, and can easily be cut into segments of user preference.

The sound loops in this pack are provided in 24-bit WAV format, ready to be loaded straight into your sequencer. All the loop files have been given a tempo value that will ensure their use in musical productions of all genres.

There’s a wide choice of musical styles, ranging from jazz to house, techno and trance, and each loop has been produced using high-quality recording equipment. While many of the beats were recorded in a studio environment, others were recorded at live performances, and they all combine to create a sound library with a wide range of character.
