The AI algorithms will not only be part of the future of self-driving cars and other AI applications. They will also be incorporated into our personal lives with increasing numbers of intelligent assistants.

At the same time as machines are getting smarter, we have also seen the growth of the internet-of-things (IoT), where devices and sensors are linked together to collect data. These data will be used to improve the efficiency of machine learning.

What is Machine Learning?

The development of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be the next revolution in computing, affecting every aspect of life.

At its simplest, Machine Learning is when an algorithm or computer is given some data and then figures out ways to use it.

For example, it could analyse all the messages we send on Twitter and figure out how people connect with each other. Or it could identify a person in a photo on Instagram, automatically and by themselves.

Machine Learning could be used by self-driving cars to plan ahead – which lane to drive into, which turn to take, which direction to go in when there are different options. The cars could also learn to avoid traffic jams, bad weather and road closures by themselves.

The algorithms would draw on many different types of information, such as GPS location, traffic reports, and data from other cars. They might also take into account information about the weather or the number of people that are likely to be out on a particular day.

When you think about it, humans learn like this too. We learn to talk because we receive information about our environment from the sounds of the world around us. If a parent is encouraging a child to talk, then they are providing information about the sounds they want to hear.

Machine Learning could change the world, bringing technology into new areas

Where is this all taking us? What can we expect?

It will be amazing if we can help more people with disabilities to live independent lives in their own homes. We will see a huge change in the way people use technology to get around. At the same time as the government provides more support, self-driving cars will allow people to travel independently to work, university, shopping and leisure activities.

Perhaps we will see less pollution and traffic jams – and an overall improvement in our quality of life, too. Of course, this is dependent on the laws of physics and technology – but I think it will happen.

The changes could come sooner than you think. Self-driving cars could be on the streets in the next decade, perhaps as soon as 2020. They will be a real revolution in the way we get around. Just think how much safer they will be than owning a car! This will save many lives every year and allow many more people to live independently and alone.

Other machine learning applications could include the following:

· Better healthcare – Artificial Intelligence and machine learning could improve the way medical decisions are made and help with diagnostics. This could save lives and give people greater freedom to be independent.

· Improved home care – Self-driving cars could allow the elderly to continue to live independently and still get help if needed. They would provide better health support for people. This could increase life expectancy.

· Improved learning – Artificial Intelligence could play a huge part in education. Learning from computer games and even online environments could help students understand science, maths, language and much more.

· Better self-management – Computers and machine learning could assist with mental health problems. They could be part of the solution for mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Machine learning will play a big role in how we live in the future

As computers and robots can learn, they will be able to be smarter and more intelligent. It’s exciting to think that they could even create their own machines. That will lead to a great many possibilities – but let’s wait and see.

But that’s not all – there are many other applications and areas of concern. For example, when robots work together they need to understand each other’s behaviour and emotions. They also need to have human traits such as compassion and empathy, as well as emotions like love and hate. When they do so, it’s called artificial intelligence.

One possibility is that we will start to lose more of our jobs, even if they are currently well-paid and routine jobs. For example, jobs like being a lawyer, a bank manager or a salesperson. But a computer could do this too. It’s all possible – but that’s another story for another day.

How can you get started with Machine Learning?

Machine learning has been around for many years. If you take a look at our blog today, you can see some examples of artificial intelligence and machine learning in use:

What can you do to make a difference?

If you are interested in developing your own ideas, this is where we have some suggestions for getting started:

Start with a problem you want to solve. The internet is full of problems and issues that need solving – from helping people communicate or move around, to helping people learn and share information. Think about something in your life that you might be able to help with. How would you like to communicate more easily? Maybe a new smart phone app could help with this?

Think about something in your life that you might be able to help with. How would you like to communicate more easily? Maybe a new smart phone app could help with this? Identify the skills and resources you need. If you have a great idea and want to make it a reality, you need the right team around you. It might be as simple as a few friends or a small team, but together you can solve many problems.

Think about who else you need. What’s your audience? Who will use this application? What is your market research telling you? These are questions you need to consider.
