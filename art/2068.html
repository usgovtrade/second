His lore, backstory, and general role in the story is also included in the Warcraft RPG. In this instance, he is also the most prominent example of a Dragon Slayer in Diablo III.

This is by no means the first time that an original character has entered Warcraft lore, however. The Night Stalkers had made their first appearance in the Warcraft RPG, and a brief mention of an unnamed character named "Eitrigg" appears in the first Warcraft movie, where his backstory is filled out further.

The inclusion of a Dragon Slayer at the end of both the Warcraft and Diablo series means that the original Diablo game should make a return. In fact, considering what was revealed in the Warcraft comics, it seems likely that one of those books will detail what the Dragon Slayer is doing for the good of the Kojast.

This is especially likely if the Diablo 3 game allows players to fight enemies that were originally included in the series, as was the case in the Diablo 2 "Nightmare Zone" raid. Considering the popularity of the series and the Diablo 3 announcement, it seems certain that this could be a likely plot twist. It will be interesting to see where things go.

Did you miss the news? Don't worry! We bring you all the hot BlizzCon 2011 news for the Warcraft, Diablo, and StarCraft series so you don't have to.

Battle.net Leaks:

There are some rumors regarding a new feature being added to Battle.net which will allow players to share information about battle reports. The feature could allow players to share how they managed to defeat an enemy, and possibly other forms of feedback. This information would then be available to everyone in the same realm and for all Blizzard titles.

Diablo III Leaks:

The new art for three legendary Diablo III bosses was leaked over the weekend. This information was revealed by one of the Blizzard employees on Twitter.

The Diablo III website has been updated to display three new pieces of artwork for bosses. The artwork was also shown off on the Diablo Channel last week. The images were designed by Matt Duszynski, and were used to announce a new set of armor and weapon rewards.

You can check out the artwork for bosses in the screenshots below.

The new art is for the bosses that are found in the "Gaping Dark," a massive subterranean dungeon that will be introduced in the third major patch. These bosses will also be introduced in the "Witch Doctor" act of the fourth major patch, and in the Act 5 of Diablo III, which is scheduled for a summer 2011 release.

The artwork was designed by Matt Duszynski, and will be the first of its kind. These pictures are being displayed to announce a new set of armor and weapon rewards that can be acquired as part of this DLC.

Arena Worlds:

There have been a number of leaks regarding new modes and additional features of Diablo III. However, the most notable one took place on the official website for Blizzard, and included a video to be released in the near future. Blizzard has since changed the status of the video to private. It is possible that Blizzard is planning on launching a new, expanded form of PvP in the near future, although it is not yet clear as to how this will work.

One interesting aspect of this leak is that the video, which was described as "An Introductory Guide to Diablo III PvP," features the Diablo BattleTag and Diablo III logos that are shown below. These logos appear in the image shown in the screenshot, and will be used in other publicity materials in the future.

There have been a number of other rumors regarding Diablo III and PvP recently, which you can see in the "What's Happening Now?" section of the Diablo III section of Gaming Blend. You can read a few of these in that section of our article.

Codenames: Hackerland's Guide to Blizzard Games will be coming very soon!

Codenames: Hackerland's Guide to Blizzard Games has been in development since the beginning of 2011. We've seen some pretty amazing content come out of it already, and it's finally starting to take shape as we hope you all know it. In the meantime, we have posted a quick update that might help you out.

The first order of business for us was creating a "How to Start a Game" section, which will include instructions for choosing difficulty and the amount of players. Another section of the game that was also updated includes how the Codenames universe evolves and changes depending on the decisions you make.

We have decided to split this section up into five pieces, which will continue to be added to regularly. This will help give you the opportunity to understand the rules of the game as you progress and make better informed decisions in later chapters. A series of "Getting Help" tips are also being added, which should come in handy for all of you who may not know what you're doing. The same can be said for the "What is Codenames?" section, which describes the concept of the game.

As a side note, we'll be adding to the Help and Guide section of the site with more resources and tools as we learn more about our audience and your needs. For example, we'll be posting information about the Codenames App and even an instructional video very soon. Stay tuned for that.

The game is still in production, and we are excited to see the ways you'll break down the game's codes. Until then, stay tuned to Blizzard Insider, and have a great rest of your week!
