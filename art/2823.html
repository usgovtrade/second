Music video
The music video was directed by H. Tsui and Hsiao-Wen Hsu. The concept of the video follows the main story line, and uses some animated aspects. The video starts in front of Tiffany's home as she's walking out to a pickup truck. It then cuts to the scene in the car where the driver is putting drugs in her. The video then cuts back to her driving home, again with the drugs, as she gets out of the car. It then transitions into Tiffany at a table for dinner, with a male figure, presumed to be her drug dealer. It then cuts to Tiffany on the ground, again with the man. She is then seen throwing him out the window of a moving truck as she walks away from the scene. Later that night she is shown having sex with her boyfriend. The video ends with Tiffany in her bed, with her boyfriend lying next to her.

Live performances
A few days before the album's release Tiffany performed "Do or Die" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and "Foolish Beat". She also performed the song on Today with Meredith Vieira and at the 2003 Teen Choice Awards, wearing an animal-print two-piece outfit. She also performed the song at the 2003 Mtv Video Music Awards.
