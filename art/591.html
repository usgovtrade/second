Guys, we are giving a presentation to the traders and originators group on 
the updated ET&S business plan in a few weeks.  Greg and I have been 
working on this for the last 4 weeks.  This plan will help to 
communicate/justify the need for the $15 million eCommerce budget we have 
requested.  I would like to discuss our current progress with you and get 
your comments.  Ultimately, we will circulate the final version of the 
business plan to the group for their comments before we make it generally 
available to anyone who is interested.  

Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the 
business/technology plans further.

Regards

Mark

FYI.  

This is a long one, but not the usual boring ENE stuff.  Also, I have not 
talked to any of you about this, but we had an $11 million loss in the 
quarter and a $32 million loss for the nine months, which includes 
ourselves.  The company is not in good shape.  However, I see some light at 
the end of the tunnel.

Best regards - 

Greg

need something lighter?



Some of you have asked for the pipe model we used in Friday's presentation. 
I don't have a copy with me ( sorry), but will send one to anyone who 
wants it. Here's the skinny on the story:

As you know, Enron has been extremely active this year.  Even our busiest 
folks like John Lavorato and Kevin Hannon haven't been able to keep up with 
our workload.  So, we have brought on three additional Hannon Ward special 
assistants (SAs) this year to help handle the increasing workload.  They are 
located in ECN/RCx1, RCx2 and EBx1.  The attached three pipes show the 
regions and teams those assistants support.  We then have an associate in 
RAC located in RACx1.  The remaining assistants support EIM.  We have also 
assigned assistants to support Gas Trading, a group that is moving to 
Fleet, and Singapore, a group that is moving to Houston. 

  



Thanks!
