This episode ends on a happy note, though, with Luke going out of his way to do something nice for her: go to the hospital to visit Carly and see the twins. He’s come a long way from hating everything about Star Wars. He even helps his mom pack her bags and head to Arizona. They have one final tearful goodbye as Luke promises her he’ll miss her, but she knows they’ll be seeing each other again. He also gives her a beautiful necklace that’s been in his family for generations. This isn’t a story where the son stays behind after his mother dies, but Luke finds the strength to leave his home and make a new life for himself on another planet.

Is the Ending Tearful and Heartbreaking?

This is the final scene of the episode and it’s supposed to be heartwarming. Of course there’s some waterworks, but the sentiment is mostly positive. The most poignant moment comes when Luke says he won’t be far away, and Carly replies “I’ll be with you, but I can’t be with you.” I don’t think Luke’s happy about going off into the wilds and being alone. And, as much as I like it when people are together, this might be the best way for Luke to go on with his life. He says that he misses Carly so much that he can still feel the weight of her hand in his—and it’s still in his. He can’t let go of her completely, even after she’s gone.

Best Quotes

There’s no way I can include every scene and comment, but here are a few quotes we talked about during our coverage of The Last Jedi. This last image is at the end of a scene where he tells her “I guess what I’m trying to say is… I’ll be okay.”

“Because even if there’s like no future for us. It doesn’t mean there’s no future. Look around! Every day should be this amazing.” – Rey, “Rey Goes to War”

“He looks so old in this one. Luke and Leia, and even I feel it.” – Yoda, “The Cave”

“I’m not a hero. I’m a war hero. I’m the one who killed all the Jedis. I’m the one who messed up Darth Vader. I took his power and now he’s after me. Because, of course, everyone knows that it’s not about winning or losing, but the journey. The experience. Now Luke knows what I really am, the journey is over, and it’s time for him to face Darth Vader.” – Kylo Ren

“They can’t control me anymore, but they know where I am. I need them to know who I am. That’s why you have to go. That’s why I’m still here. If they can’t control me, they can’t hurt me. But they will try. They can’t let us be together. They can’t let you be together with me. They will try again. I’ll be ready.” – C-3PO, “Starkiller Base”

“The most dangerous adversary is the one you never know you have.” – Kylo Ren

What You Need to Know

In this scene, Ben tells Kylo that he’s not like his grandfather, Darth Vader, and that he’s his father, which will come to play later in the film. It’s pretty amazing that Kylo is so in sync with his abilities as a Dark Side user at this point. He says to Rey that Kylo Ren was born to destroy her. This is not necessarily true, though. Ben and Luke had a falling out, and we see the fallout in the background here. Ben also tells Kylo to find his grandmother. I wonder what happened to him.

Best Scene

Before we get into “What You Need to Know,” let’s talk about the scene at the end of the episode. Rey returns to Ahch-To and finds Luke’s students with a bunch of kids they were hiding from Imperial enforcers. They’ve all been hiding in the caves, eating and living together, ever since Kylo killed all the Jedis and burned down the Jedi Temple. It’s a great use of The Last Jedi’s visual effects, too. You can really tell from the ground that the entire planet is littered with wreckage and ruin, just like what happened in all those Star Wars films before it.

The last scene is as touching as the ending of the series. Luke tells her “I am here to learn. I am here to master my abilities.” Rey responds, “Like you trained me?” It’s a gentle moment between them, but it’s not completely surprising that this old, weary Jedi master would give up everything for her.

Why Didn’t Ben Save Kylo?

The next scene between C-3PO and Kylo is a great one. C-3PO is being stubborn, saying “I am all yours,” when he doesn’t mean it at all. We don’t see the scene between them where Kylo Ren turned on Ben Solo, but we saw him turn on Han, when he snapped at Chewie. Kylo and Rey are connected and that’s a big deal, but if C-3PO was so great at following orders, why didn’t he order Kylo to not turn on Ben Solo? At least we saw the end of Kylo’s relationship with Luke, because that scene was really touching and I’m glad Kylo ended up with the new Force powers from Rey.

This scene is all about two people fighting, though. It’s a little jarring because we see what they were like together at the end of the previous episode, but this is where C-3PO finally realizes his own failure. He’s had a history of failing and it’s his own fault, but this is not the first time we’ve seen Kylo show his true colors. Rey is a better person than C-3PO, and he recognizes it when he says “Rey! You’ve done it! You’ve redeemed me.” This moment sums up Luke’s whole life: his failures, his losses, and his accomplishments. He tries to teach us to “avoid the Darkside,” but he knows it’s about the journey, not winning or losing.

We see the end of the relationship between Rey and Finn here. He still does everything for her, and she still defends him, but he’s finally doing his best to stand up for himself. Luke says he failed as a parent. He teaches him how to walk, but it’s the wrong lessons. Luke is no different than anyone else in this galaxy, except that he failed his son. Finn and Rey never even get a real goodbye between them, and we didn’t see Finn ever see Rey again after he left her on Jakku to work with Leia. This is another one of those themes that are carried over from A New Hope: the need to be part of something bigger than yourself.

Rey never wants to take from anyone, but she’s also starting to understand the importance of giving back, even if that’s just a selfless act of friendship for Rey. As far as Rey is concerned, that’s a victory over the darkness that lives inside of Kylo. Rey doesn’t need him to accomplish her own goals, and she can give him space to go and do his own thing. Even though it’s sad to see Finn go, it’s also liberating.

Snoke Was Right: We Have a “Jedi-Killer”

At the end of this scene, Kylo is ready to attack, and he has been for a while. He has been waiting for the moment to turn against the other Sith. That’s the end of their reign, as far as he’s concerned. When Kylo was with the Knights of Ren, he was still being controlled by Snoke. Rey is no match for him now that he’s become more powerful than anyone else.

Best Moment in the Episode

The scene between Luke and Rey is a really good one. It’s a tear-jerker, even though it’s a happy one. Luke is ready to see Rey again and see how well she’s been doing, but she has news for him that is hard to hear. She tells him that she lost Ben Solo to the dark side and that he turned on his own family and friend. She didn’t even try to look for him because she knew what she’d find if she did. When he asks why she doesn’t look for him, she says “I think I know why. It wasn’t the world he wanted, it was me.” Rey is on a journey for her own destiny, while Luke is stuck in the past. He’s ready to join her in her mission, even if she is no longer trying to find her way home.

A Long and Hard Journey for Rey

Rey doesn’t tell him that Kylo Ren is her father. That’s a conversation she needs</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:51
