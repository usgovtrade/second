She had been right, only time will tell. The truth will certainly out. But at least now, there was a new beginning, a re-definition of our future. A new hope for us all.

The End of an Era

I had a very bad feeling, like something very bad was about to happen. When it actually did, I wasn’t prepared at all. There was really no way to prepare for it. No logical reasons for what I was feeling were available. There were just feelings that I could only identify as intuition or psychic warning signals.

Not a week went by when I did not think about our friendship with Nora. I was glad that she was in her new place and doing well, but we had lost a close friendship and there was nothing I could do to bring it back. It was not something I could change or fix. We were no longer as close as we used to be. It didn’t really matter to me, but it did matter to Nora. I would see Nora soon, and I would not be saying, “I missed you.”

As I was getting ready for work on Wednesday, April 4, 2014, a very disturbing feeling came over me. It was an unusual feeling, something I couldn’t shake or change. As I kept thinking about it, the more this feeling got worse, like something was pulling me down, pulling me in. I had been to the mall in the past few days and realized that a strange feeling came over me as I was on the bus. It is weird that I didn’t consider this or think about it at the time. I was focused on something else, perhaps a more urgent matter that had come up in my life. I never connected it to my friend or what happened to her and the house she lived in.

When I arrived at my new place of employment, I found that it seemed as though I was being followed. The feeling continued, growing and pulling me deeper and deeper into a dark abyss. I left work, a bit confused, the feelings never disappearing. The pull was real and I didn’t think I could be imagining it. It was similar to a strange feeling when my mother would die. All at once, everything went dark. Just like that. She was in the hospital dying of heart failure and I was in my bedroom in Tucson, Arizona. When I got the call, I didn’t know what it meant. I thought I might get a phone call saying my mother had died.

I had a feeling of dread and doom. Like something that was going to happen that would take away all that I had worked so hard to obtain and get back on my feet. I felt a profound sense of loss. Not just for myself, but for so many others. A weight fell upon me. I was a nervous wreck, not wanting to get sick because I would be left alone in a strange land. I felt alone and very empty and empty and alone. Not a single word of comfort was offered to me.

It was this odd feeling, almost a dread, that lasted for about a week. Then I started thinking about how it would be best if I gave up everything and went to live in the mountains of the West or the Northwest or the deserts of New Mexico where people were less intelligent, less educated and more simple. I kept telling myself that I would go back. I couldn’t let this feeling go and make a rational decision to give up, as I was very close to making such a move to escape from my present life.

My friend Nora is still alive and does very well as to her recovery from a brain tumor. She will make a full recovery and life has become more colorful again for her. And I will be seeing her soon. As for our friendship, all the hurt, rage and pain has been removed with the healing and forgiveness. It is like the beginning of a new and better chapter in the book of our lives. There are many stories left to tell about Nora and the adventure of life that she shared with her many friends. She had a positive, fun spirit, positive outlook on life and worked hard at achieving her goals and dreams. I have no doubt that she achieved her dreams and goals.

I keep wondering where she is right now? Her job is secure and her health is good. Her spirit will continue to be strong and shine with life, love and friendship. There will never be another Nora who will ever know the depth of love, faith, loyalty and caring that she had. It will be like losing a part of myself in a strange way. I will never know anyone like her again. What a good friend I have lost. She was kind and always a good listener. She gave me an open ear when I needed a friend. I have no doubt that she will have a wonderful future ahead of her with no hardships and no regrets. What a life we had. I can not say it enough. It was a truly wonderful life, full of laughter and friendship. I look forward to our next adventure. Life can be good again if we are open to what it offers.

The good and the bad will always happen in life. I can not change it. It is what it is. What we do with what happens to us in life is up to us.

Our dear friend from California, Nora, needs our prayers now more than ever before. We know her as our friend Nora, who we often see and visit. She is struggling right now and may need a helping hand and the strength of her friends. If any of you can think of anything that may help, please forward it to her. It is just impossible to write anything because I am not doing well myself.

I feel the need to call in to Nora’s life and be her helper, just as she had been my friend. My brother has been gone for almost three years. My sister Nora, who is in her mid-sixties, and was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. She was given a prognosis of four months left to live. Today, three years after her diagnosis, she still has not had a procedure. With Nora’s heart condition, she could have any number of problems, which may be life-threatening. If anyone would like to donate to the fund that will help her, please let me know. She was diagnosed with a form of esophageal cancer called esophagitis which is very rare.

My sister has not been well. She has had a problem with her stomach for some time and has lost many pounds and developed diabetes. She has been very ill, but always has a good smile and a positive attitude toward life.

When Nora and I met, we met her brother and my brother-in-law. There was one female friend, another brother and her brother. There were my brothers-in-law and sisters and their families. I lived in a tent in a park for almost three years and I only knew Nora during that time. It was a very special time. I had a good education in college and a good career ahead of me. As soon as I was able to move into an apartment, I was employed as a secretary with a major company and did well, always able to help myself and my daughter through hard times.

My father died on September 20, 2011. It was my father’s birthday. I am not sure if it was coincidence or not. Nora’s brother celebrated his birthday on September 19, 2010. My sister is in a nursing home for her heart condition and a variety of other conditions. The doctor has her under orders to be prepared to have a pacemaker inserted. Her brother who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer is fighting for his life. They say that he has four months to live, but as of this writing</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:52
