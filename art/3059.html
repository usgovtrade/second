About Skycorp, Inc.

Skycorp is focused on developing fully-autonomous robotic systems for in-space missions and future colonization of other worlds. We develop technology and space capabilities to enable humans to mine the asteroid belt and the moon.

Skycorp’s technology for robotic mining is a critical component of future asteroid missions. Our current mining robot technology can mine ore from asteroids with multiple robotic spacecraft as components, using a system of robotic vessels that work together to accomplish a common goal. The first Skycorp mining craft have been designed and built and include autonomous hardware, software, robots and avionics.

We have already created robotic systems that explore the surfaces of asteroids, map lunar craters, characterize and excavate surface regolith and other geological processes for the benefit of future missions and space colonization missions.
