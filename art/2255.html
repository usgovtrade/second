"Every time we have gone we have found a new, fresh, beautiful space for him to sit and take in, reflect, and be."

She continued: "We were shocked and horrified when we walked into the park and saw these images. Our three-year-old son is always looking for bugs and rocks and butterflies, etc., and to be completely honest we thought the photos showed us a scene that our son had taken on his own. We had never seen anything like it before and the thought of what could have happened to him never crossed our minds."

"This was not supposed to be our reality. The idea that someone could do that to our beautiful, precious baby boy absolutely devastated us, made us sick to our stomachs," the mom wrote. "I am so angry and sad. How in the world does something like this happen?"

"My wife is so distraught, as are we all," the dad wrote. "We will never be able to find the words to tell our son what happened to him."

"Even if there is justice in the legal system, my son will never be able to understand that someone did this to him," the dad continued. "His innocence will be forever lost. We know our son will not grow up knowing what happened to him, and that is absolutely heartbreaking."

"I cannot imagine what that little boy went through. What it was like for him to come out of anesthesia and wake up to this face."

A GoFundMe campaign has been launched to help the family. Click here to learn more and donate.
