Quiggly went to the edge of the darkness and stared into the darkness. Quiggly blinked and turned around.

Suddenly, there was a voice, a voice Quiggly had never heard before in his life. "What did you have for lunch?"

Quiggly froze and stood there in shock. "It's a girl..." he thought.

However, Quiggly remained, motionless. No, he didn't know if it was the girl who spoke before. A voice like that would be impossible to forget. Quiggly walked away from the edge of the darkness and stood in front of the other side, staring into the darkness with interest. It was not possible, he thought. He would never be able to forget it. But was that really possible? Is it even possible that I would be this lucky? Could someone live such a happy life as to say such a nice, yet not so common word? Is that really possible?

Quiggly walked around the edge of the darkness, and stared deep into the darkness. There was nothing in the darkness. Quiggly walked into the dark side of the room and looked around. It was a quiet place that he hadn't been in a long time. Quiggly was in awe of what the darkness could show him. The darkness was so deep that it was as though he was falling in. Suddenly, Quiggly heard a voice that sounded like the voice he heard before in his imagination.

Quiggly couldn't believe it. He walked a little further to see the voice in the darkness. The voice appeared from everywhere and nowhere. Quiggly approached the voice and stared at it.

"So, Quiggly. You're here, huh?"

Quiggly replied, "Yes, I'm here."

"So, what are you doing here?"

"You know what I'm doing here."

"No, I don't know what you're doing here,"

"Are you dumb?" Quiggly asked.

"No, no, no, I'm not dumb. I'm just new here, so I don't know many words. If you were me, you would know what I meant. After all, I am myself."

"Oh, I see," said Quiggly.

"So, do you come here often?" asked the voice.

"Never."

"Really?"

"No."

"Why not?"

Quiggly was about to respond, but he remembered what he saw earlier. It was a terrible thing, but it really happened. He would never forget it. Quiggly shook his head as he remembered the situation.

"Well, you see...I....I....I was here yesterday. I didn't want to go because it was really hot. I wanted to stay in the shade. I wanted to go and listen to a story, but I didn't want to go at first."

"What kind of story was it?"

"It was a sad one. It's about a very poor boy that went through some tough times in his life. But he found out he needed to be a little more clever in order to get a better life. He did become successful. But it was too late for him. One day, he got sick and passed away."

Quiggly's blood ran cold. He didn't want to continue his story, but he couldn't hold back. After all, it was not a completely sad story, but it was still very sad. He didn't want to be sad. It wasn't fair that he was saddened by something that had no relation to him. But what was he supposed to do? The story was true. Even though it had not happened to Quiggly, it happened to someone. No one was completely happy, so Quiggly shouldn't feel sad. This is just life. Quiggly finally continued his story.

"So, the boy got sick and, to make a long story short, he died. The thing that I don't understand is that he doesn't have any relatives to speak of. He did have a wife, but she had died a very long time ago. His parents were already dead and his siblings had scattered, so he was all alone. He even went to the grocery store and bought his favorite ice cream cone. When he finished his work, he turned and saw that there was someone on the street who looked like him, in red. But when he approached him, he realized that it wasn't him. He didn't know what to do. So he kept on walking. He walked on and thought that he really didn't want to go to the grocery store. However, he turned around one more time because he didn't want to be a lonely man who walks on. When he turned around, the same man was there, looking at him with an annoyed face. He stopped, he walked up to him and he pulled out his pocket knife. He raised it up, but he wasn't even sure if he was going to be able to survive. He couldn't handle a pocket knife; he had never handled a pocket knife before. Suddenly, a stranger walked past him. The man was in shock. Then he turned around and saw that it was a woman who looked a little like his wife. He walked up to her and he said, 'You know, I'm really upset. I was so close to killing this guy before you saw me. Do you know the worst thing about the afterlife is the fact that all these people are hanging out everywhere?' The man turned around and looked at the woman. 'So...you know who I am?' The woman answered, 'I really don't.' The man turned around, and she walked away. The man walked away, and decided that he was going to have a lot of free time before his death. That's what I'm telling you. This is just what I heard about the story."

The voice walked away, far away into the darkness, and Quiggly saw no signs of it.

What a nice tale. If only I would have been listening to it. However, Quiggly shook his head to realize that he had not even heard the story yet. He got lost in his thoughts while he was still in the beginning. Now, he missed it. He missed the story. He missed the words that were in the darkness. He never knew such a nice, yet sad, story could exist. Quiggly was deeply saddened by what he thought he had heard. He shook his head. The story made him feel sad. That's all he remembered about it. Quiggly walked a little further into the dark room. Quiggly wanted to hear the words in the dark.

"I'm here!" Quiggly said.

"Yes, I'm here."

"So, what are you doing here?"

"You should know."

"Why?"

"Because you're me."

Quiggly could hear the voice in the darkness. He didn't answer, but instead he just walked towards the darkness. Quiggly took one step towards the darkness and started to listen.

"The man kept on walking and found a friend."

"Really? I am not surprised."

"Why?"

"Because most people would be surprised."

"What did he find?"

"He found somebody that knew him."

"Who?"

"A relative. He found his wife."

"Really? How did you know?"

"Because I'm you."

"Oh, really?"

"Yes. I know. I feel sorry for you, because you are blind.

Quiggly tried to listen even more closely. He was a little closer to the darkness now.

"I'm sorry," said Quiggly. "So, why are you standing in the dark?"

"I wanted to hear your words more clearly."

"Oh? Why?"

"Because I'm sure that you would say something really nice for someone in front of the darkness."

"Really? I didn't know it would make a difference."

"Oh, really? Maybe I should do something to make you happy."

"Really?"

"Yes, really."

"What would you say?"

"Yes, yes, yes, yes!"

"Oh, yeah! Thanks!"

"What?"

"Well, I've heard those before."

"You have? When?"

"Well, let me think for a second."

"No, I want to hear it now."

"Oh, yes, okay."

Quiggly decided that he needed to talk to the voice in order to take out all of his problems.

"Well, you're a nice person," Quiggly said.

"You think so?"

"Yes, I think so. You are very, very nice, Quiggly."

"You're being sarcastic?"

"No, not at all."

"Oh, thank you."

"No, no, it's the truth."

"You're a good person."

"Oh, really?"

"Yes, really."

"You really are a good person, Quiggly."

"Yeah, I really am</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:22
