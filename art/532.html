our passion for making the most valuable solution possible to our customers.
In this case, the cost of the work we are doing in our laboratory is 
justified by the quality of the product we are providing to the market.
Being so demanding about the quality of the projects, we have been forced to 
impose the same level of quality in the work performed by the software 
development partners.
This requires high commitment and significant costs that I am sure nobody is 
going to be pleased with. 
Again, we feel this is the right thing to do to make our product better and 
attain our goal of providing the best quality solution to our customers.
I would be very interested in any thoughts and opinions.
Thanks very much.
Krzysztof Jakubowski.
