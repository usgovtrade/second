1. Our ability to provide accurate pricing and risk assessments is being
   compromised by our lack of ability to explain or track exceptions to our
   approach, or our inability to articulate our approach to new audiences.

   2. Enron of the past will be hard for us to reconcile with Enron of the
   future.

   on yesterday's model but instead reflects the market, the new economy
   environment.
