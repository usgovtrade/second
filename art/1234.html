The first of the “big moves” tribute games was never released, but its gameplay has been recreated faithfully in a sequel, Big Moves 2.

With its iconic tunes, catchy sound effects and excellent sprite work, this game is worth the download if you want to relive the era of 16-bit gaming.

Big Moves was a runaway hit, and even saw an obscure sequel called Big Moves 2: Sega Remix in Japan (thanks to our reader Goo for pointing this out). So perhaps the game was more popular than its creator anticipated.

This version is playable in English, although Japanese and Korean players may prefer to go with the Japanese version. A number of sound effects have been converted from Japanese to English, but some of the speech has also been altered. It’s a good game though – it’s just a pity that it’s not on any formats I can play!

The game was converted by a fan who goes by the name of Dr. Drosselmeyer. “A tribute to one of the greatest musicians of all time (sorry Tupac, Prince and David Bowie),” he writes, and I’d say he’s got a point – this game is a masterpiece.

More Gameboy

If you loved playing Game Boy games on your Sega Master System or Mega Drive/Genesis, you might appreciate a similar game for the Game Boy. Game Boy Mega Man is one of my favourite Game Boy titles, as it’s one of the best games ever made for the handheld console, and is the perfect blend of classic gameplay and visuals, all wrapped up in a brilliant game design.

The game has simple graphics and limited gameplay, but that simplicity and focus on action makes for a memorable experience. It’s great to have an unofficial sequel, and I hope there are more to come.

The game is from 1989, and can be played with an LCD or Pro AV adapter.

The game itself is an unofficial sequel to the original Game Boy game, Mega Man, released in 1987.

This original Master System version was one of the first ‘portable’ games released for the console and has become an evergreen classic to the platform. Featuring one-player gameplay and simple controls for jumping, shooting and exploring for three different robots: Mega Man, Proto Man and Bass (a later addition to the series).

As a handheld original, it features an extended ending sequence in-game and extra stages. It was followed up by a special edition released in 1991 with enhanced graphics for higher-resolution monitors, but which has since been made playable in every system and still available to download online. It is worth playing this game in its native form – although, we do have more Mega Man experiences if you need a follow up:



Sega Ages – The Ultimate Version

It’s the Master System incarnation of Mega Man that is most loved, but many fans prefer to play the original Japanese Master System game. If you want to re-experience Mega Man’s first adventure in its proper ‘native’ form, a Japanese version is probably the way to go. It has many subtle differences and is the better of the two versions for people who want a true recreation of the first game.

But, if you’d rather play a more complete version (albeit one with more of a budget), you can check out one of the many Japanese games that has been ‘localized’.

Sega Ages Mega Man is an excellent Mega Man game for beginners, featuring a number of enhancements, as well as extras such as an extra character, a time attack mode, and a ‘tutorial’ video mode – all of which make the game a very playable version of the original game.



There are a number of extras you’d find on almost any Mega Man game, and this is a good example of the platform’s diverse library of games.

And, if you like that game then check out Sonic 3 and Streets of Rage 2 which were also put on the Mega CD.

As a bonus, Sega Ages also includes Mega Man 3, which was previously only available as a premium Sega Game Gear port.



Mega Man 9 – Super Nintendo

Mega Man 9 is one of my favourite SNES games and I can appreciate just how hard it was for the team to create this masterful game. It went way over budget and over time – so they had to get back to the drawing board. This new 3D version is a massive leap over the previous games, but it still remains true to the classic Megaman concept, by including the same style of game design and gameplay. This made it so perfect for new players of the series and still enjoyable for veterans.

Although the game is fun and funky with its cartoon-like illustrations, character designs, and soundtrack, I must confess that when I started this review, I couldn’t play the game due to technical problems – this meant that I had to find an emulator and work my way through it (I hope you will forgive me for this, Sega). Once the technical issues were out the way and I was able to play the game, it was well worth the wait!



What better way to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original Mega Man game than with a new release? With all the different versions of Mega Man, you may have been spoilt for choice. I mean, we have the Genesis/Mega Drive and Mega CD games, the PS1 games, the Game Boy games, the Master System games, and the XBLA game. And yet, the series has only just arrived on the Wii, with Mega Man 10 in development right now.

I can’t wait to see what else the team at Intelligent Systems will come up with. And if they really do make Mega Man 11, I might need to start taking notes.



Sonic: Lost World – PlayStation 4

Lost World comes at a crucial point for Sonic. While it doesn’t make the series completely original, it’s a crucial step in the team at Dimps bringing the Sonic franchise back to its roots.

For a generation of gamers who were Sonic’s first players, playing this game and then going back to Genesis or SNES in 1994 was like a dream come true. But with the development of new generations, all those fond memories must be tarnished. Today’s ‘veterans’ don’t have the same experience as me and my friends – and yet they’ve still waited years for this game to arrive. Now that it is, we can enjoy a fresh game experience – one that keeps us up with the times.



The Genesis/Mega Drive version of the game for the SNES is a very good game with high replay value – and, if you own a PC or are able to download emulators, there’s more Sonic goodness awaiting your attention.

And if you can’t play the XBLA or Wii game, just check out our other game reviews. Although the PlayStation 4 version isn’t as good as the original, if you’ve got some cash to spare, then perhaps the DLC levels will give it the extra edge.

Sonic: Lost World is not perfect – but then what game is?



Shantae: Risky’s Revenge – Xbox 360

“Shantae was great, but what’s this ‘risky’ business?”

Well, as much as fans loved the original Risky’s Revenge, they really warmed up to the sequel and its expansion, Risky’s Revenge: Party Up.

The game is a reimagined version of the original Risky’s Revenge, adding more levels and new gameplay mechanics, while keeping the same excellent platforming feel that we love. Even with its slightly longer running time, the game never outstays its welcome. This fast-paced Metroidvania platforming title is just plain fun and I hope to see a full trilogy of these games on the Wii U (and maybe a PC release too).



It is a great game with fun characters and a variety of bonus levels. This is exactly the type of game I want to revisit on the Nintendo Switch!

And if you’re looking for more Shantae, check out Shantae: Half-Genie Hero – this game is one of the better Metroidvania games available on the market and has a strong narrative. It is available for the Nintendo 3DS.

There are so many great titles in the Risky’s Revenge series, I can’t possibly list all of them, but I did list the rest of my recommendations in this article on another platform for you to enjoy. So be sure to check them out when they become available on Nintendo Switch.



Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing – Xbox 360

There’s a lot of Sega in our lives. Mega Man has gone on to conquer almost every console of the last 30 years, the Yakuza series has a cult-like following and the Sonic franchise remains one of the most popular, but how many games did Sega develop in total?
