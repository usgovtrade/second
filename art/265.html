I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
everything. 
-Why? 
-It is too complex. If we had just taken the bribe, all we would have had 
to do is report it to the company and there would have been no record of it. 
That way it is in the open, instead of being sealed, like a secret. 
-But we took the bribe. 
-So? 
-So there is a record. 
-A closed record. 
-No. A closed record. You just won't report it to the company. 
-There is nothing to report. We took the bribe. 
-Yeah, I know, but just let me see what I can do. 
-Good, thanks. 

 -You're welcome. 
-Come by the office next week. I want to talk to you about something. 
-Oh, I don't know about that. I got this new job, and I am going to work a 
lot. 
-Oh yeah? -At night? 
-A lot? You? 
-No, no, no. 
-I have worked a lot. 
-Uh, have you? -I don't know. 
-I went to the office, but you weren't there. 
-I was gone. 
-Oh? You didn't go there very often? 
-No. I didn't go very often. 
-But you said... 
-I've been there. 
-So, what did you want to talk to me about? 
-I don't know. 

 -Hmm. 
-So, how did it go? 
-How did what go? 
-The interview. 
-Oh. Well, that is over. We didn't... 
-Yes we did. 
-What? 
-I just had a great time. You are so stupid. 
-No, you didn't have a great time. 
-Yes, I did. It was a great time. 
-You didn't have a great time, you are just making it up! 
-No. We talked about a lot of things. 
-No you didn't. 
-I did. I can't wait to tell you about it. 
-No you won't. 
-Well, we were going to meet for dinner and have a little wine together. 
-No. 
-We were going to have dinner together and talk about the job. 
-I don't want to talk about the job anymore. 
-No? And just to talk? 
-Yeah. I want to talk about something else. 
-Well, there was no talk of the job. We just talked. 
-We were just talking. 
-Yeah, right. You were just talking.
