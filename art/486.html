I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
everything.” 
“They said that would be perfectly acceptable.” 
“Chris, don’t you know what you’ve done?” 
“No, what have I done? 
This can’t be the way. I’ll never get them all to go. 
There’s no way I can get them to stay. 
This is impossible!” 
“Yes, Chris, it looks like it is impossible, but you 
can make it possible if you try.” 
“I have to try?” 
“Yes, of course, you do. 
That’s part of being human. 
You can’t just give up, especially when you’re 
working on something so important.” 
“What if I can’t do it?” 
“Chris, you can do anything if you try. You just 
have to set your mind to it. 
You always have, don’t you remember? 
I remember when you used to play with the 
scraps of paper and the rubber band. 
You made airplane wings and you were trying 
to fly them off the chair. 
And then when you didn’t get the hang of that 
you decided that maybe you could fly. 
And you did, all the way to the window. 
I saw it with my own eyes. 
Anything is possible if you really want it.” 
“I never knew you saw that.” 
“I saw you fly off the chair and off the table and 
off the window. 
It was a most impressive performance. 
And you were only about four or five.” 
“It’s just so wonderful to hear you say that 
because I really do believe it. 
You’re right, all I have to do is try. 
I can do this. 
I can do anything.” 
Just remember that you already are what you’re 
after. 
Don’t give up, even when you don’t succeed the 
first time. 
Don’t start something unless you’re absolutely sure 
you can do it. 
And be patient. 
Wait for the time to come along when you’re 
ready. 
Just keep trying. 
You can do it. 
I know you can. 
Okay, the other person is you, standing somewhere 
with a problem you want to solve. 
What should you do next? 
Here’s the strategy. 
The first thing is to make a very clear, 
accurate description of the problem. 
Remember: It’s the job of the 
description to give you the essence of the 
problem, but it’s the job of the solution to 
complete it. 
What’s essential in a problem is that all 
possible solutions be considered. 
You have to get down to a simple abstraction 
where all the variations can be explored. 
In most cases, that will not be the whole 
problem, because a complete solution cannot 
fit inside a word. 
The next thing to do is to recognize that 
you’re attempting an impossible task. 
The thing is impossible, but you must try. 
Just don’t give up! 
In fact, that is your first step. 
The second step is to get rid of old 
prejudices. 
If it’s a new problem that you haven’t had 
before, this is a valuable exercise, but 
sometimes the task may be so difficult 
that you have no choice but to tackle it 
again. 
It will take a lot more determination. 
Maybe the first time around, you just didn’t 
have the fire of determination to get 
through it. 
Now that you understand that the job will 
be impossible, the real job is to create a 
strategy. 
Now’s the time for optimism and determination. 
Remember, it will take more than one try to 
solve a problem. 
Strategy is needed for a second try and for a 
third, fourth, and maybe even a fifth try. 
So, what strategy should you employ? 
First, you have to make the complete 
description. 
A complete description is essential in a 
strategy. 
And a complete description will help you to 
define a strategy. 
You have to define your strategy before you 
begin to apply it. 
You have to write down your strategy before 
you try to use it. 
It’s your strategy that you’re going to use, so 
make it clear. 
What will it consist of? 
Strategy can be a very general statement or 
it can be as specific as you wish. 
In a sense, it will be specific because you’ll 
write down that strategy, but the word 
“strategy” will be generic and will be your 
handle for the process of solving the problem. 
Make it a concise statement. 
When you first think of it, it will be a long 
statement. 
You have to practice, working with many 
different problems, coming up with short 
generic statements that capture the essence of 
the problem. 
The objective is to use your strategy 
on the first try. 
Strategy can have components. 
There will be separate components in your 
strategy. 
One will be your means to acquire the essential 
resources. 
The resources are the material means that 
you need to employ to get a result. 
Those can be inanimate objects such as a map 
or a diagram, a document, a book, or even 
even a notebook. 
Or it can be the resources that you have, such 
as time, your intellectual skills, and many, 
many others. 
It might even be an acquired ability like a 
strategy that you learned before. 
Then you need the resources to get results, to 
get to your objective. 
Resources can be knowledge, money, physical 
objects, and so on. 
Resources are the means to get a result. 
You have a strategy to get resources. 
Then you have to get those resources to work 
for you. 
Resources can be used directly, but usually 
resources can be combined or organized to 
get the results. 
One part is in place, but it won’t work until 
you get the resources to function with it. 
There’s a plan to get those resources to work 
for you. 
Then you have to get them to work for you, 
all of them. 
And when you’re done, you want the result. 
Now you can see the components that are in 
the strategy. 
You have to know all of these elements in order 
to succeed. 
The question is, how do you achieve these 
results? 
What are the steps, or components? 
This is where strategy often begins to form. 
What are the parts, how do you do it? 
Strategy is in place. 
Now you have to think about each component 
in the strategy and consider how you can do 
it. 
Now, to develop the strategy, we have to look 
at each component. 
What’s it look like? 
How do I get resources? 
What are the resources? 
What do I do with them? 
What do I do with them? 
What are the steps? 
Strategy is in place. 
What are the things that I have to do? 
You’ll do something with resources and you’ll 
get results with the resources. 
The strategy has a plan for strategy. 
Now what can you do with your strategy? 
Strategy is in place. 
Strategy for the strategy is a plan. 
Now the plan is what? 
What are the components that you have to 
consider? 
What are you going to do? 
How are you going to get results? 
The strategy has a plan for strategy. 
What is the plan of the strategy? 
Remember that your strategy might be too 
general. 
The problem is that once you have that, you 
have to determine a strategy to get it done. 
You have to think of the plan. 
Strategy is in place, but you have to develop a 
plan. 
How do you develop a plan? 
You get a plan by considering the elements 
of your strategy. 
What will you do? 
You might have a general list of things that 
you have to do. 
When you know your strategy, you must 
understand the components that you have to 
take into account to achieve your strategy. 
It’s a process of going back and forth. 
You need to put in the effort to do this. 
This is what you must do in order to get the 
results</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:37
