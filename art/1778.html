If
your dog is being exposed to other dogs that have not been
vaccinated
for kennel cough, it is important to start it on a strong
antibiotic right away.
I find it is really important to be proactive and help with
this
disaster, which affects the entire world.
It will
affect your animal's health and yours and it will spread like
wildfire in a matter of days.
You can expect your dog to be contagious
for at least two weeks.
You
need to keep an eye on it, keep your hands away from your face,
and make sure you wash your hands when you're finished with your
pets.
Be extremely careful and proactive with your animals.
If you suspect a dog has kennel cough, the safest thing to do is
to have your dog vaccinated.
It's a serious disease, and I recommend you talk with a vet
immediately.
I've had a lot of
feedback on my videos, so
please
share your thoughts.
Please post in the comments if this helped.
I will definitely answer your questions.
If you've got a
question about a specific dog or breed, I'm pretty good at that.
I'll get to your questions in a very short time, so please be
patient with me and don't let a great question slip through the
cracks.
I'd love to
help you and your dogs.
Please stay tuned and subscribe.
I post my
videos every single day.
Thanks for watching!
See ya!
Bye, love ya.
I'll see you in a few days.
