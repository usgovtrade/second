It's a little different from your other stuff, you know, it's different just cause it's got other factors in it like that, but it doesn't change my whole feelings and how I feel about them, but I think it's very interesting.

I don't know what you were going for, or if I'm talking about the wrong things, but I don't have any problem with that at all, and when you talk about it, I really don't get it. I just think it's so cool.

Bret: Are you still doing these interviews?

David: I have done two in the last two years, and I'd like to have a long conversation with you.

Bret: All right.

David: We can get on the phone, it's not a big thing, but I'm curious how you like to interview people in your show, and I've been doing interviews for 10 years or more now.

Bret: It's funny. I had you on the radio show several years ago, remember?

David: Yeah, I do.

Bret: And I just had Steve Harvey on, and he was a big fan of yours, and you were a big fan of his, but when I told him that you were going to be in the show, he was like "What?! You have David Letterman on?!"

David: You know, you see somebody in person, like Chris Rock or something, and they do an interview. Some people want to be on the radio show, some people want to be in movies, some people want to be famous. My friend has written a book that's coming out, and that's kind of what he wanted. He wrote this book about being in a mental institution, and he was in there for a few months. He had a lot of different people go over to visit him in the institution, and it was really fascinating.

And I just thought I'd try it and see what I'd get out of it, and it's a little bit fun, and a little bit interesting to see that different people have different motivations. And I guess, the point of that show was more people can be themselves, and talk about their problems. There's really not that much that's so personal in any of my shows, and if I did this for 10 years, that would be 10 years of just me talking about my problems.

Bret: Right. So you're looking at someone's career, and trying to see how it affects their life, or is there a real connection, or is it just money making it easy, or what is it?

David: Oh, it's a weird situation. My best friend got me a job at an agency on the West Side, as a model recruiter. The agency I'm doing this for now, which I've been doing it for about two years, it's more a service than it is anything else, like a personal shopper or something. And it's fun, because everybody's been trying to get me to do things like that, and I haven't really liked doing things like that.

But once in a while, some kids who come in, some older guys come in. They're a lot different than the people who hire me. And these guys are funny, and they know some really interesting things.

Bret: Well, you seem like a fairly interesting person, too. So if you come up with something interesting, or you run into someone that's interesting, you give them a call.

David: Yeah, sometimes. Like I said, my best friend gets me a lot of these things. It's hard for me to go out and do it myself, though.

Bret: Well, it's hard when you're on the road. I don't like that, though. You know, people are always telling you about stuff.

David: That's one thing I would change about my radio show, but I think that one I would always keep. I hate to say it, but I think we have to be our own best friends.

Bret: Yeah, you can't really tell us to our face.

David: I know. I've been trying.

Bret: There are some things that are hard for us to accept ourselves sometimes. I got that once when I took the bus to a big town to have lunch with somebody. I said, "Wow, I get to drive down to a big city and have a big meal." It's hard to imagine that.

David: What did you have for lunch?

Bret: It was something. But we're always telling each other, "Be your own best friend," because you've got to do that before you can have a good career.

David: Do you think the way to do that is to just tell everybody about yourself?

Bret: Do you think that's really the way to do it? If somebody does that, is that you basically are just telling everybody about yourself? Or are you saying something else? Is there some message about them or about somebody else that it would be valuable for the rest of the people to know?

David: Sure, but I'm not talking about me. You want me to talk about myself and my feelings about that, but if I started going into what I would do as a career, I think you can figure out where that leads.

I mean, I was going to see a psychiatrist for a few years now, and I don't know if I'm still in the mental institute.

Bret: You are. I'm doing the show, which is sort of like talking with your psychiatrist.

David: Oh, that's funny.

Bret: Yeah, it was funny how you said that.

David: I started doing it because my mom kept putting me in, my brother called me because I'd been putting myself in these mental institutes for years. They said, "You know, you're always doing these things and it's really just not you, it's something you think you're doing. You don't need to be there."

Bret: You know what? There is a bit of a difference, I think. What we're doing now, with the mental health, this whole experience is something else. This is about what life is like as opposed to just the problems and the issues that people have that they think are problems.

David: I understand that, and I totally get that, but even as a psychiatrist you have to do the same kind of thing. There are a lot of things that are just outside, people have to go about things in a different way.

Bret: I think it's easier for some people to do that. Some people can get an idea and just work on it, and some people have to go back and put it all together, like you're saying. They have to sort of take a step back and think about where they're going, instead of just taking the next step. I think this kind of life is easier for some people, and it's a different approach, for sure.

I have another thing I want to tell you about, but I want to ask you about this first. Because you've been so successful in your life, you've been on TV, you're an interesting guy, you've got interesting stories, and here's what I'm going to say. The one thing I always hear, I know I always used to hear, you know, if you were at a party with somebody and the guy was interesting, I heard if he was funny, and the guy was interesting, he's got to be really funny. I think about you, because you are, and I think about people who are interesting and funny. So this is the first thing I want to ask you. I wonder how your mind works. You have a lot of fans, you're a very intelligent guy, I'm sure you had people say this, so tell me what you think. How do you get your fans? Do they call you? Do you ever get asked by somebody "How do you do this?" What's the connection?

David: What's interesting is how you kind of talk. I think it's hard for people to really get what I do, because I don't have some of the people who are famous, like Will Smith or somebody like that, I don't have somebody to compare it to. I mean, I see them sometimes, but I don't really have that kind of thing. So you have to talk about what you do. Like, if you really take people's time to talk to them, if they're at a talk show, and then you start talking about what it was like to work for the guy who was just on TV and he was kind of an asshole, they might be thinking about that guy, or they might want to go to the bathroom, or whatever. And then I'm having a conversation, and now I've got this guy's attention for a minute. I mean, that's probably how I got a lot of my fans.

Bret: Yeah. But is that really the only reason? It's still a conversation.

David: It's not the only reason. I just think it's a way that you do it.

Bret: That's interesting. I always think</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:53
