His second album, Nuggets II, was released in 1993. His third album, B-Boys of the Death Row, followed in 1995. The title of his third album pays tribute to a gang of wild boys in south Central Los Angeles who would gather around the home of the late rapper Tupac Shakur to play together, "b-boy" being the slang term for that set.  It contains the standout single "I Get Lifted".

On October 5, 2006, The D.O.C. appeared at the 2006 San Francisco Hip-Hop Day Festival in an interview with the Bay Area radio station KMEL.

The D.O.C. was a mentor to the hip hop artist The Game, who also attended a high school located in Carson, California, the same high school where Tupac Shakur had taught.
