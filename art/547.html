I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate 
things. You do what I said. You're on your own with this guy, and we are 
going to be in Austin Friday. 
Chris: He's coming on a plane from Houston. 
Dad: His plane lands at 4:30 in the morning. Just pick him up at the airport. 
Chris: I don't want to pick him up. It's too risky. 
Dad: Well, OK. Then leave him at the airport. 
Chris: What do you mean, "Leave him at the airport?" 
Dad: "I'm coming to get you!" I'll fly to Houston and get you. 
Chris: No, I don't want you to get on a plane and halfway through the flight 
decide you don't want to do this. It's too risky. 
Dad: I know I'm coming to get you. I'm not going to sit here and argue. 
Chris: OK, fine. Just don't do anything stupid, please, Dad. I mean it. I 
don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose either of you. And if anything 
happens, that I don't go home again, I want you to know I didn't go out 
somehow trying to rescue Pops and not Mom. I just want us all back home. 
Dad: Tell him he can fly out with us when I get there. 
Chris: You are not coming. I already talked to Dad. I already got my ticket. 
He's just upset. So I'll just finish packing, all right? I'll finish 
packing and I'll finish out here, and we'll fly out when he gets there. 
Dad: I'm getting on the plane. I'm coming to get you. Don't do anything 
stupid. 
Chris: I love you. 
Dad: I love you too. 
Chris: Mom does, too. 
Dad: I know she does. 
Chris: She's going to cry if I don't get on that plane. 
Dad: So are you. 
Chris: Not as much as Mom. 
Dad: Tell her I'll be home for Christmas. 
Chris: I will. And I won't let you down, Dad. Don't worry. 
Dad: I won't. 
----- 
When I reached home, I told my parents what I'd done and why. I told them 
that everything was OK, that we'd get him. I told them I loved them. I 
didn't want to worry them and ruin their holiday. And we all waited for word 
on Chris. We watched the clock, we talked about him. We got word that the 
plane took off. They landed. He didn't. They waited at the gate. They kept 
watching the flight information board. They listened to the tickers on the 
television news. They heard about the crash on the way. 
An hour later, there were no answers. A few hours later, a relative got on 
a plane to bring my father back. My mom decided not to fly to Houston that 
night. The next morning, a phone call and a knock at the door. He didn't make 
it. 
We didn't see him again. After that, we just went back to work and school. 
It's like everything stopped. Everything except us. That's how it felt. We 
were left there. We decided to live our lives. One day passed. Then another. 
After months, years. There's no way to do it. We tried. There's no way to 
describe what we went through. Chris, he took the loss hard. I saw him cry 
when we lost him. He still cries sometimes. 
Dad never really recovered. He still tries to stay active. He'll go to 
something like a holiday party and sit on the floor and eat. But it's hard 
for him. We don't talk about him, his loss. We talk about him. We don't 
talk about the day we lost him. We don't talk about how we felt. We just 
talk about him. And we don't cry. No one does. We can't. He's gone. No one 
can understand it. No one can explain it. We just hope he's OK. 

You can't imagine how hard it is to write this. We'd like to share it with you 
in case you're going through this pain. There's no end to it. And I'm just 
glad I could be there for my mom. 

It's a hell of a story. There's too much loss. There's no ending. There's no 
final chapter. There's no one to blame. They were just in the wrong place at 
the wrong time. But there are no answers. And there's no way to make it all 
right. 

That's not the lesson here, though. That's the message. They were in the 
wrong place at the wrong time. And we'll never get that moment back. 

But we don't want to give up, do we? We don't want to give up. That's the 
point of this letter, I think. That's what we learned from them. No matter 
how hard it is, no matter how bad it gets, no matter how much loss we 
suffer, we just keep going. We have to. It's the only way. 

We just need to keep going. The good times keep us going, but the tough ones 
also keep us going. Those are the times we need. 

We got them there. We can get them there. All of them. We'll be there. We'll 
make it right. 

We're not going to give up. 

If you've ever lost someone you love, it is hard to write. But it is a 
beautiful thing to share this with you. 

I know some of you don't think I should be sharing this. I know a lot of you 
don't understand how I can. But to me, it's all about the love we had. 
Sharing it with you makes me feel closer to them. And we all have to feel 
closer, don't we? 

I'll never forget the day I first got to meet Chris. It's one of my 
favorites. He was in the hospital. I remember thinking that he looked so 
terrified. I think he felt more like he was in the wrong place than the 
right one. But I didn't care. I said he could be in here as long as he 
needed to be. I don't think he ever really believed that he'd make it. I do 
believe he'd come back, though. He always came back to us. He would fight. 
And we never gave up. 

I hope the messages of hope reach you. We must keep going. No matter how 
hard it is. No matter how much you think you can't take it. You must. You 
must just keep going. 

This is a difficult subject, I know. So many lose someone so very dear. But 
I can't do it justice if I don't share it. Please don't stop reading. Let 
me explain why I'm sharing this. I can't get through this without you. I 
need you. 

I believe in hope. I believe that if we keep going, eventually we'll make it. 
Hope is a powerful thing. It can carry us to great heights. But you can't 
keep it without truth. 

It was the same with my parents. If we kept going, if we kept hoping, we 
would have eventually made it through those dark days. We still go to a 
little spot in the garden, where we planted a tree. We take turns going and 
just thinking about them. We get their ashes and spread them and go visit. 

You see, we were the tree. And they were our roots. There is a place we can 
go. It's a place where we can feel at home. It's a place where we can talk 
about them. It's a place we can share their loss, even though it was hard to 
share what was happening. There are other people out there who are hurting. 
And they need to know that there is a home for them too. 

My parents left this world at the worst possible time, but they left it 
strong and sure, knowing the plan God has for each one of us. And their plan 
was for a good one. He knew how to comfort them. 

The point of all of this is to never give up. And this is an ending and an 
ending that's more sad than I can put into words. It is the ending that we 
don't want. It's the ending that we know has to be. We know we'll get there. 
And I hope my story can help you keep going in your grief. I hope you can </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:42
