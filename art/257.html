I, at least, have a
lover's confidence that there is another side to your thoughts about
Diana, and that another side has more reason to feel deeply than we, or
than any man.  He, I can guess, is your brother's brother, and you know
it would grieve her heart--though she is your lover's friend--to know
what had been done to him, or what has been left undone.  I can say no
more now--here or hereafter.  But this I promise you, that if I return
to Ireland, I will speak to him, and if I can do him justice, I will do
it.  At least, if not, I will help him to do it for himself.  My heart
bleeds for him.  You can do that which you feel to be good towards him,
if you will, Mr. Roche; and if you will not, well, then, it is my
friendship and not his brotherhood I ask you for."

I was about to answer, when I was startled by the sound of voices
coming near. I could not help thinking what a contrast it was to the
murmurs of the Atlantic!  I listened, and I heard the voices of some
policemen who were patrolling the gardens of Ballymartin. I turned
abruptly to Mr. Roche, and he seemed in the same instant to realise that
the interview must come to an end.

"Let us come again," he whispered, "to-night, to-morrow, any time."

"When I can.  But I must be the one to see that the occasion is
favourable," I said.

"No, no, you must not do that," he answered; "no, no. Let _her_ ask, and
if she desires you to see me, let you tell me."

"I will tell you nothing until you promise," I answered.

"I promise."

"And nothing more?"

"Nothing more," he repeated, and took my hand in his.

It was now nearly one o'clock, and looking down from the wall, I saw the
two policemen approaching and heard them saying they had been round the
walls of the castle and were going to begin the ascent, which they
expected would be difficult and protracted.

Mr. Roche led me to the wall and put his arm in mine.

"Good-bye, sir," he said, as we paused at the wall; "I will remember
your words."


V.


When I returned to the house I saw from the distance a carriage waiting.
I hurried to Mrs. Keogh and told her what Mr. Roche had said. She
received my news calmly, and I saw that she had her reason for wishing
that the young man might appear, and all my fears were dispelled. I felt
that if he were seen by any of our friends, if any suspicion were given
rise to, it would mar our plan.

"I have had a talk with the steward," I said to Mrs. Keogh. "It's all
right. He will keep the servants in the hall till after dinner, and when
all is quiet I will slip out with some of them and let the young man in
at the lower back door."

"Will you tell no one else?" she asked.

"Only my cousin and old Keegan. The men are sure to be about the
garden."

"Your cousin will sleep well to-night."

"As to that I have no doubt; but you may depend upon it he will sleep
soundly. Do you know, Mrs. Keogh, I believe he does it on purpose."

"What makes you think that?" she asked, with a smile.

"Because he takes no real interest in the affair. He is as dull a man as
one could wish to see, and I think it vexes him to have any one
interfere with his repose."

"He will think nothing of what has happened to-night," she said,
hastily.

"It is very possible," I replied; "but in any case he will soon sleep
it out. I will tell him in the morning, however. Good-night, Mrs. Keogh,
and good luck to you. Is there nothing else?"

"Nothing."

I returned to the hall, and took from her an old white neckcloth. "I
have got a white neckcloth from your room to wrap up in," I said, "for
this young man."

She smiled and nodded, and then stood and looked into the empty grate.
"It was a mistake, sir," she said at last, "in your going in and waking
him. You would have done better to let him sleep."

I knew her anxiety, and answered: "You would not have had me suffer
to-night. He is an old man, and would have suffered greatly."

"But he would have been more angry, and would not have helped you in
anything."

"That is as it may be. You want him to help me, Mrs. Keogh?"

"I want him, and all of them."

"Well, I am sure they are your best friends."

"They are more than that, and you shall see. I will talk to you
to-morrow."

"Do," I said, with some secret admiration, "and I will answer you
to-morrow."

She smiled, but said nothing, and I returned to my room. When I reached
it, I found Mr. O'Grady on guard.

"What do you want?" I asked.

"I was wondering," he said, "what Mrs. Keogh would do if she had a bit
of luck."

"Did she not tell you?"

"No."

"Then you must take your oath she did not."

"Take oath? Will she not take oath? She's too smart to do that.
However, I'll stay, and I may as well put out the lantern, for it will
not be up till to-morrow I'll be."

"I am ready for bed," I said, impatiently. "You had best let me hear the
news in the morning."

"I will, if you like," he answered, laughing; "but you are getting
anxious. Do you know, Mr. Barry, I was looking out for you?"

"Did you think I had fallen down the stairs?"

"That I did, sir. If I didn't think you were dead, why should I think
you were mad?"

"Because I may be mad, Mr. O'Grady, but I am not dead yet. Good-night."

He went back, chuckling at the thought of the surprise he was
preparing for us, and when he left me I undressed and slept. I knew that
before him lay the most difficult task of all, and that when it was
accomplished he might have his due share of my thanks.

I was now confident that if I had seen the man at the window I should
have been able to speak to him; but as I had not seen him I had to
depend upon my other means. While Mr. O'Grady and the others were in the
garden, I must get him away from the place. It would be hard work for me
if I could not succeed, and I could hardly realise the fact that I
intended to try and succeed. It seemed so much easier and more pleasant
to do what was required of me by trusting Mr. Roche, and I was afraid
lest I should fail.

It was past one o'clock, and I determined to watch till I was
assured--by my own conviction that I had had my fair share of rest--that
I should not oversleep myself if I rose early. My bed had been very hard,
and I had thought little of it, but now that I was awake and alone I
felt my limbs fail me, and my head became heavy. I was very tired, and it
was hard for me to keep my eyes open and keep myself awake. The
afternoon was a heavy one, and all through the hours of the night the
night noises--the noises of the old castle--continued. I fancied now
that I heard the footsteps of the people in the other apartments, and
the murmur of the voices of two or three was audible. Some one was awake
in the neighbouring room, and the distant moaning, which in any other
place and at any other time I would have found soothing, was now to me
only a sign of the sleeplessness and disquiet of my mind. It seemed to
be a part of the misery which had been caused by the suddenness of my
return to Ireland, and its presence struck me with some alarm. But I was
too excited to sleep and too intent upon the object which I had
determined to accomplish before I slept to hear the night noises and the
voices which came from the rooms around me.
