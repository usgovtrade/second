He also added that he won’t be performing on the show due to his recent hospitalization.

In a statement issued last Tuesday (Nov. 9), the singer wrote, “Thank you everyone for sending me so many prayers and well wishes. I did have emergency surgery Monday afternoon for bleeding in my stomach, but it went smoothly and I was released this morning.”

However, “I was already feeling much better,” he continued. “It will be a long road to recovery but I’ll be fine. I’m home with my family and feeling stronger every day.”

Prior to his hospitalization, YG was scheduled to headline this year’s Rolling Loud Festival in the Bay Area on Jan. 27. Last week (Nov. 4), he was forced to pull out of a scheduled performance at New York City’s BK Live. A spokesperson for YG’s management team confirmed that he will no longer be performing with Logic at the annual Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Jan. 26.

According to TMZ, YG went to a local hospital for emergency surgery Monday afternoon (Nov. 8) after complaining of stomach pain and fatigue. He underwent a successful surgical procedure the following day and was released from the hospital Tuesday (Nov. 9).

“So far the procedure was a complete success,” YG wrote. “I’m feeling great and looking forward to the new year! Lets go.”

Ticketmaster has reported that YG’s performance at the Rolling Loud festival will be rescheduled for an undisclosed date. “Everything’s been moved to Friday, January 25,” a spokesperson for the festival told Billboard, adding that the date was chosen “to accommodate fans who want to make sure they get their tickets for this very important show.”

As previously reported, rapper Logic will headline the first Rolling Loud concert of 2019. His headlining set, which has yet to be announced, will also take place Jan. 25.
