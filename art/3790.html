Critical reception 

The album was released to positive reviews from critics.  One reviewer described it as "one of the best debuts of the year so far, and an album that should garner as much attention as the likes of Snow Patrol, and Arctic Monkeys did in 2006."  Another said "With it’s mix of 60s garage soul and garage punk it makes it's influences very apparent, but that is never a bad thing, far from it in fact".
