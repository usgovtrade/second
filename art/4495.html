(a) providing a label comprising a label substrate layer having printed thereon a labeling code, and an adhesive backing layer,
(b) pressing the label to the container so that said container and said label are in contact with each other along at least a portion of the side wall of the container, and
(c) providing, by means of said adhesive layer, an adhesive bonding of the label to said container.
The invention further relates to a device for applying such a label on a container, such as a bottle, which is rotatably supported by a turntable.
In the field of labeling containers it is known to use label assemblies comprising a label and a detachable backing sheet that is removably attached to the label, so that the consumer can be convinced by the visual impact that the label assembly is the manufacturer's original product. Thereby a problem arises when the label is to be applied on the container at the bottling plant. Typically the container may be a bottle, such as a PET bottle having a round cross section. In the case that the container is a bottle of any other material and/or shape, however, it is clear that the label has to be carefully placed on the container such that at least a portion of it adheres to the container and at least another portion stays suspended and is away from contact with the container.
This problem may arise, for example, if the manufacturer provides labels on which one or more printed or pre-printed codes or characters, such as for example trademarkes, brand names or logos, that need to be visible on the container, are located in positions close to each other so that the color of the label may be of no help for the purpose of aligning the label properly.
Another example of this problem arises if the manufacturer wants to apply on the container a marking that does not come in contact with the product and is provided in the form of characters or symbols that shall be easily readable by a scanner that is positioned in a packing line, for example in order to check the bottle integrity at the bottling plant.
In both cases the container must be identified by code and/or by a pre-printed code and the corresponding code has to be read when the container is being transported in a high-speed container production line, and by means of a computer system this information must be linked to the label material, i.e. to the respective label.
In order to solve this problem, several solutions have been proposed which, however, are rather complex and expensive to apply or are prone to misinterpretation of the desired labeling in high speed lines.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,829,582 for instance discloses an apparatus and a method for labeling containers with labels with a barcode thereon using a hand-held adhesive sticker and a computer system to read a barcode on the sticker. The method provides that the barcode information is read on the sticker while the sticker is on the container. This requires handling of the sticker as the sticker has to be positioned on the container prior to reading the barcode and removed after reading.
In WO00/25957 a labeling apparatus comprising a printer and a print wheel is disclosed that is to be rotated with respect to a container as it is being conveyed in a conveyor line. For reading the code or characters on the print wheel the containers have to be rotated one by one in order to have a side of the container in contact with the print wheel. The print wheel also has to be oriented in parallel with the container as it is rotated in order to allow reading of a plurality of characters. This involves time consuming manipulations with the print wheel and also risk of a plurality of codes or characters not being read or being read incorrectly.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,769,629 describes an adhesive label assembly for printing barcodes on a roll of labels with a printer and applying the labels to the bottles or other containers. The labels have an adhesive backing and are provided with perforations corresponding to the size of the barcodes. The printer identifies the labels which are then picked up and applied to the containers.
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method and device for labeling containers. In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved method and device for applying a label on a container with the help of a barcode in which the above problems are solved.
The method according to the invention comprises providing a label having a label substrate layer having printed thereon a labeling code, and an adhesive backing layer, and placing the label on the container so that the adhesive backing layer of the label adheres to at least a portion of the side wall of the container.
By providing a label that comprises a label substrate layer having printed thereon a labeling code and an adhesive backing layer, the label may be placed on the container so that the adhesive backing layer is attached to at least a portion of the side wall of the container without any intermediate steps, and in particular without any steps involving rotation of the container. By providing this type of label, which is typically applied manually, it is possible to apply the label on the container without any manual interventions, in particular without any steps involving rotation of the container or removal of a peel tab provided on the label.
Advantageously, by providing a label according to the invention in which the label substrate layer and the adhesive backing layer are laminated, the label may be provided in a flat shape. This facilitates application of the label on a container since it does not require any particular alignment of the container and label when positioning the label on the container.
Moreover, the method according to the invention may be performed by means of an apparatus comprising: a turntable for carrying a container so that the container is rotatable about a rotational axis, and an electronic device configured for reading the labeling code of a label on the container. This enables to automatically read the labeling code and to associate this code with the container so that the container is given an identity, i.e. is automatically labeled. In this manner it becomes possible to employ a pre-printed label to which no additional code or code-indicating marks are printed, since the label code is read and automatically associated with the container without the need for any manual operations.
Preferably, the label code may be read while the container is being conveyed by the turntable. This involves a simple and inexpensive arrangement as the label may be read while the container is in motion.
The label code is preferably a barcode which may be read by a barcode reader, for instance a laser scanner or an optical scanner. Such barcode readers may be located at a position relative to the turntable where they are capable of reading the label code on the label as the container is rotating. However, also in case a barcode reader is not provided it is also possible to pre-program a computer, for instance a computer of the container packaging plant, with information that is related to the barcode (like the product number) in order to allow identification of the container.
It is noted that according to an advantageous aspect of the invention, the labels may be provided by means of a label printer for printing one or more labels on a roll of label substrate. In particular the labels are printed by means of a continuous label printer having an ink supply and a print head (roller) which is capable of printing at a circumferential speed that is higher than the conveying speed of the containers. The method may then comprise using the above-described label printer in order to apply the labels on the containers. This enables to further simplify the labeling process, as it may be automatically applied by means of a label printer.
Preferably, a container on which a label according to the invention is applied may have a round cross-section. However, it is noted that the method according to the invention may also be applied for labeling containers with a polygonal cross-section, for example a square cross-section, and the inventive method and device may be used also for this purpose. In this case the label according to the invention may be provided in a shape that is adapted to the shape of the container and thereby to the shape of the container. For example, the label substrate layer may be a tape provided with a round printable region and an adhesive layer for adherence to the container. Such tape can be cut to the required length and then wrapped around the container. The inventive device may then be arranged such that the container rotates on a turntable and that a label is provided by a printing device and the adhesive backing layer is adhered to the side wall of the container after being placed on the container.
In particular, it is noted that a device for providing a label according to the invention on a container, such as a bottle, comprises a support for supporting the container, said support being configured such that the container can be rotated about its longitudinal axis, and an actuator device for transferring the container from the support to a labeling position where it is possible to place the label on the container.
