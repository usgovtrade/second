Regarding the number of tests and tests per year performed, the researchers said that as a result of the current situation, "There is an urgent need to strengthen the control system and accelerate the elimination of these contaminants by taking appropriate steps, particularly by strengthening monitoring and prevention. The authorities also need to provide a more effective inspection and testing system".

The results of this study concluded that in many instances, the level of lead was greater than the allowed maximum level by the WHO. "It is very likely that this lead level will cause adverse health effects, especially in infants and children".

Dr. Salama said that "as a part of measures to prevent and control lead exposure, especially among infants and young children, we recommend that health and environmental authorities in Lebanon implement the WHO protocol for lead testing and elimination from the environment and work with them on the identification of risk populations and the implementation of early preventive interventions in order to avoid lead poisoning in children."

"Lead Poisoning, Environmental Health Issues in Lebanon"

The researchers, after gathering the results of blood samples from children in Bekaa and Mount Lebanon Governorates and results of the blood samples sent to them from another children's hospital in Beirut, and adding their own examination of those samples, concluded that these results confirm the high level of lead in the blood of Lebanese children.

The study includes more than 2000 children from the six governorates where the blood tests were conducted in order to confirm the high level of lead in their blood samples. A total of 5,750 children from the six governorates were examined for lead poisoning and the results showed that lead exposure is occurring at a rate of more than 30% for some children. Lead poisoning is an environmental problem that has affected all ages, especially children, with effects on physical and mental development.

The children were divided into two groups: those living in Bekaa and Mount Lebanon and those living in Beirut. The study shows that despite the fact that more children live in Beirut (68%) than in Bekaa or Mount Lebanon (30%) as they may have better access to health care services and the blood test does not differentiate between the two groups, the results confirm that the lead poisoning rate among children from Bekaa and Mount Lebanon is far higher than that for children living in Beirut.

Moreover, the analysis of children living in Beirut showed a low rate of exposure to lead, with 10.9% of children from a group of 646 children suffering from a high lead level. This was lower than in the two other groups of children studied in Mount Lebanon and Bekaa which were 20.7% and 27.4% respectively.

The study also confirms the correlation between lead exposure and child's age. "The percentage of children exposed to lead is significantly higher among children under the age of six". It was also noted that "children of 6 and 9 years are less likely to be exposed to lead." It is worth mentioning that a child aged 1 year or older who was tested as part of the lead exposure survey was living in Beirut.

On a positive note, the survey also shows that the percentage of children who suffered from acute lead poisoning dropped considerably from 14.2% in 2008 to 7.3% in 2013. "This signifies a statistically significant decline in lead poisoning among children" according to the report, but still indicates the existence of a problem in Lebanon with regard to lead exposure in children.

The findings of this study were highlighted by Dr. Dheeb, a member of the research team and head of the hematology and environmental exposure laboratory at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), who said "this study confirmed the reality of the existence of a real serious problem with regard to lead exposure in children and the importance of continuous action with regard to prevention, awareness campaigns and treatment programs in the battle against this harmful toxin."

Dr. Mohammad Jawad, another member of the research team, said "The importance of continuous research and awareness campaigns was obvious due to the fact that, unfortunately, this has not yet led to the effective implementation of the program of prevention and elimination of lead. Moreover, a decrease in the frequency of lead poisoning cases among children aged 1-9 years and among those living in Beirut, although minimal, does not indicate a reversal in the increasing trend that has been observed in Lebanon for years."

Dr. Dheeb said that "the continuous increase of the number of lead cases for children under 6 years old shows that programs must be expanded and lead awareness must be strengthened, in addition to more stringent measures and a more extensive plan to strengthen the control system in order to prevent and eliminate this toxin."
