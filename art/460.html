lunch Monday through Friday from 11:00am - 2:00pm.  Enjoy a delicious tuna 
sandwich with your choice of chips or salad.  Lunch specials will also be 
available Monday through Friday.  

On Wednesday, February 21st Joe's will have its St. Patricks Day Party.  All 
day drink specials will be available for $2/$1.50.  The first 50 people to 
come in will receive a free Shamrock Shake.  A cash donation to the Irish 
Lesbian & Gay Organization will be collected from each member at each of your 
tables.  The money will be used for AIDS prevention activities.  

As a result of these efforts The Center of Gay and Lesbian Excellence (COGALE) 
is pleased to announce that it has pledged $3000 to the Houston Food 
Connection.  

The Center of Gay and Lesbian Excellence (COGALE) sponsors six community events 
in Houston each year.   For the 2001 calendar year COGALE sponsored events in 
the following areas: 
Food/Fitness/Fuel/Fuel Oasis, Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, Youth Center, 
Community Events Calendar and Transitional Housing

COGALE sponsored events are dedicated to enhancing the community for sexual 
minority youth.  While sponsoring six events this year, COGALE is asking for 
your assistance with raising money to keep the food programs going.  

Joe's Bar and Grill will host the 2001 Transitional Living Luncheon (featuring 
the speaker Joe Kolman and emcee Burt Crenshaw) on Friday, February 16, 2001.  
The event will be catered by Aramark.  Dues paying members of CORE and the 
Lesbian and Gay Task Force will receive an invitation.  

This event is one of six sponsored by COGALE and is a luncheon geared toward 
the needs of the newly housed and homeless.  Since 1992, the Transitional 
Living Programs of the Center of Gay and Lesbian Excellence (COGALE) have 
provided shelter and housing to nearly 4000 homeless LGBT individuals, over 
1800 of whom were placed into housing through the programs of the Center of 
Gay and Lesbian Excellence (COGALE).  The Center of Gay and Lesbian 
Excellence's Transitional Living Programs provides housing and supportive 
services to those who have been forced to leave their homes under less than 
ideal circumstances.  On average, the Center of Gay and Lesbian Excellence 
places homeless LGBT individuals into housing in a period of 30 days.

It is our mission to help break the cycle of homelessness that continues to 
affect our community and to help individuals to maintain independence by 
providing housing, food, counseling, HIV/AIDS prevention services and  
supportive services.
