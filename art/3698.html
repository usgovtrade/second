You’re in the presence of true love. We don’t care about anything other than love, and that’s what the universe is made of. Yes it’s bigger than anything you could imagine, and that’s why it’s called the big picture.

This is where you can start to learn your next lesson… that the big picture is a work in progress and change is inevitable. The best part? You get to decide if it is change for the better or for the worse! So stop holding on to past mistakes, start accepting new mistakes, and always remain hopeful that it could become something you are proud of at the end of this journey.

6. That’s all there is!

“Don’t believe everything you think.”

We’ve said this a million times now, so don’t worry about that. Still, you gotta hear it one more time because you deserve to hear it one more time.

There is so much more out there than you think.

You will meet new friends, you will find new love, and you will find an endless amount of inspiration. That is the real world, and it isn’t just for you.

This idea that there’s nothing out there is simply just an excuse you make up to tell yourself that this world you live in isn’t for you. That’s complete bullshit. The only thing that could ever make that statement true would be if everyone believed it, and there’s a reason why everyone doesn’t think like that.

Life is only meaningful when you accept that there’s a higher purpose for you in this world. But if you don’t believe that, then you won’t give it a chance. And trust us, you need to give it a chance because it’s not just for you.

So keep dreaming.

So keep believing.

And stay hopeful that you’re working toward something greater.

Always remember that we’re doing this together, and when you really put it all together, it’s a game changer. You gotta take care of it if you want it to keep growing! You can’t ignore what’s inside you because you will miss out on everything you want. No exceptions. Just accept it and welcome it in to help fuel the rest of your life!

This is what we’ve wanted to share with you all because this is what we believe is true. You deserve it.

Do you think there’s more out there for you? What have you learned so far?

Well said! I’ve said it before, but love what you have to say! I love it when you put more out there about the universe being that it is because people don’t understand how crazy it is!
“There is so much more out there than you think.” I’m always in disbelief at what our universe has to offer! I’ve learned so much from your posts, thank you for sharing your experiences and your amazing journey so far.

This is so cool, thank you for the post! I agree that people make excuses for everything which is completely normal but I love that you wrote this post as I think it’s important to remind ourselves that the world is full of so much love! Can’t wait to read more from you!

So glad you found my blog because I am going to go take my own advice! It’s so hard to see the beauty in everything when you’re surrounded by your own negativity. You should definitely see this post as an awesome reminder. Thanks for sharing it!

“There is so much more out there than you think.
You will meet new friends, you will find new love, and you will find an endless amount of inspiration. That is the real world, and it isn’t just for you.” This couldn’t be more on target. Great reminder! Love this!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:48
