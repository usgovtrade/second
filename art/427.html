This was a nightmare in the making. Quiggly’s body shook as if there were a thousand quilting flies inside him, making it difficult to concentrate and focus.

The figure emerged from the bush, its head drooping low. As the man leaned forward, a strange yellow glow surrounded the area and a low growl escaped its throat. Now fully enveloped by the fire, the figure’s body shifted into the form of a giant serpent with a long tail. It lifted its hand, which was enveloped in a dark green glove with three fingers, toward the cowering man before it who cowered closer to the trees. Now that Quiggly was closer, he saw that the eyes of the monster were large, dark, and unblinking. These were the eyes of a beast from the depths of hell, which were only held back by the fire in the monster’s hand.

The man jumped in fear. He opened his mouth to scream but no sound came from his throat as he fell limp on the ground. Quiggly dropped to the ground and placed his hands over the still man. As he struggled to get the man’s pulse, he tried to remember how to give CPR but, as if knowing, the man started to move and looked to be in some sort of trance. He then placed both of his hands on either side of the man’s head and continued to look into his eyes. He watched as the man’s eyes became distant as he stared at the sky. Quiggly knew what was going to happen, as he was already familiar with this particular method of death. Quiggly shouted in the monster’s ear and watched as its snout turned away and the flames died out, turning its hand to normal skin. The man sat up slowly, now in the form of a six-foot white, bald man in a business suit. He looked out at Quiggly, who was lying motionless in the forest, but before he could look away the man passed out again, as if his head was in a trance.

I was afraid.

This time Quiggly was afraid because the man was staring right at him. This was the same man who had just been in a fiery snake-like form, watching from his eyes. This was the same man who had just died, being reborn as someone else, and staring at Quiggly. Quiggly was afraid of the man’s stare, so he ran out of the forest into the man’s house. His body felt as if it was being squeezed by a vise. Every time he exhaled he felt as if there was a fire in his stomach. This man had no soul and had no real intentions except to end Quiggly’s life. Quiggly ran into the house and tried to take cover from the flames which seemed to be everywhere in his house. While running back to the kitchen, he noticed the man’s green glove sticking out of the front door. As he grabbed the glove, a horrible feeling came over him and his body felt as if it was being squeezed from the inside, like his body was burning up from the inside. He found the nerve to pick up the glove and slowly pulled it on the outside of the door.

He slowly peeked out the door and saw the man sitting in a chair on the porch smiling at him. His suit was wrinkled and his yellow tie was askew but his appearance did not change. The man held out his hand and gestured for Quiggly to come toward him. Quiggly had no choice but to obey the voice that was now inside him. He walked out of the house and slowly approached the man who stood up as Quiggly neared. As he walked toward him, the pain in his body increased and he felt as if his stomach was trying to exit his body. His clothes began to feel like they were melting into his skin, which now felt tight.

Quiggly’s eyes fell on the glove as he walked into the man’s outstretched hand and he was able to see a silver ring in the center of his palm. The man made him turn around and brought his face closer to his. He wanted to look at the man, so he tried to twist his neck and looked up into the eyes of death. The man whispered in Quiggly’s ear and said, “I am the keeper of the void.” As he spoke, he leaned over the man’s body to face the street. His skin began to become transparent, causing Quiggly to scream as he tried to run away but he was unable to move. Quiggly started to sweat, then his body began to feel as if it was a ball of hot lava as he could feel the flames underneath his skin. As he fell to his knees, he saw the hand of the man appear through his own, as if it was looking into the cavity that was inside of him. Quiggly screamed and fell back on the ground. The flames on his face and body then consumed the house and the earth around him. The man rose to his feet and his body disappeared as his house was consumed by flames.

As the fire engulfed him, Quiggly ran out of the forest and ran all the way home. Once he arrived, he rushed inside and sat down to his couch. He felt as if he was still being shaken and was sweating as if he had just run a marathon. He began to cry because of his pain and his tears fell to the floor as he continued to have a convulsion.

Quiggly opened his eyes and felt as if he were looking through the eyes of the monster. His body felt as if it had become a prison for him as it had taken over his very being. The flames on his body had gotten worse and it felt as if the fire were going to take over. Quiggly grabbed a knife and looked at the moon as it started to glow bright red. He knew what was coming next but could not help himself. He wanted to scream but his body could not move. A dark shadow appeared in the shadows of his room and became enveloped in flames. Quiggly watched in terror as the man came closer and closer to him. He watched as a white, shadowy hand reached out and grabbed him by the face.

The End

Author’s Note: There is a reason why this story is at the end of the book. This story is intended for my own enjoyment and entertainment and does not accurately reflect my personal beliefs, as it is fiction and the purpose is to inspire the imagination. However, if this story was indeed to inspire a person with any kind of desire to practice witchcraft or any type of witchcraft-related activities, one must remember that the craft is a real entity and does not discriminate. There is no “good witch” or “bad witch,” only the “real” witch. Furthermore, the “real” witch doesn’t go and kill you unless you wish to “call” her to come and kill you. It’s up to you. If you think you might be a witch or you think you know a witch, the only real advice is: Never try to summon a witch and never call a witch by her true name. They can only come to you if you call them.

The same goes with this book. When you first read it, I asked you not to give it a second thought or a second glance. You were given a simple tale of something I think should exist in this world, so that’s why this story came to be. This story is not a real piece of art. It is my form of art to you and to me. In other words, if you read it, please pay more attention to the story than the words written. That’s all I ask.

I know it sounds like this book is a horror novel, but it isn’t. There are two types of horror novels; the ones that make you jump out of your seat and the ones that make you scream. The only place I want you to jump is out of your seat. The only things that may scare you are the monsters in your head. This book is actually a type of love letter from me to a friend, and a friend of mine gave it to me to read a few weeks ago. He said the title describes the book exactly. This book is a love letter to life, death, the universe, the earth, the stars, the moon, the stars, the moon, the stars, and the sun. This book is my love letter to you, because I know that this book may save some of you from your worst nightmares. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed writing it. And for you who want to know, if there is such a thing as heaven and hell, the good witch and the bad witch, and so much more, please read the book. Or don’t read the book. It doesn’t matter. My book is not a religion nor am I an expert, so if you don’t believe in any of these things, that’s fine. Either way, I know I have done my job.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:33
