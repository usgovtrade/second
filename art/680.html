   The company said it has no other choice but to issue debt and 
was facing the prospect of a cash shortfall in the fourth quarter, 
the quarter ending Aug. 31, even if it gets a lift from the U.S. 
Treasury. 
   J.P. Morgan, which has been advising Enron on the debt front, 
last week began talks with the banks. 
   ``The issue is not whether we would issue debt. The issue is 
when we issue debt,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan said. 
   Enron shares rose $1.07 to $13.50 and the company's 7.4 percent 
notes maturing in 2006 were bid at 77 cents on the dollar, up from 
the par value of 65 cents, according to Trace, the bond-price 
reporting system of the Financial Industry Bond Analysis Group. 
   Govt Woes Fall on Enron 
Enron's struggles help illustrate the fallout of the U.S. economic 
slowdown on different companies. 
   The Houston company, a trader of natural gas, electricity and 
other commodities, has been a star performer this year, up almost 
200 percent since the start of the year. 
   The stock has been driven higher as investors piled into 
energy shares and bid up shares of other natural gas and power 
producers. 
   The stock has fallen underperforming the overall Dow Jones 
industrial average by about 25 percent this year. 
   Govt Troubles Hit Energy Stocks, Hurt Financials 
   The stock price decline comes as investors continue to shun 
banks and financial shares, moving assets into more secure sectors 
such as energy. 
   The shares of J.P. Morgan Chase slipped 0.7 percent and 
earnings fell short of Wall Street's expectations, the fourth 
consecutive quarter of declines. 
   The other big banks, Citigroup and Bank of America, have 
reported losses from soured investments. Enron has tumbled on 
concerns that in addition to its own trouble, its deals with 
partners such as the New Power Co. could face increased scrutiny 
from regulators. 
   Meanwhile, Enron's woes also hurt shares of other natural gas 
and power producers. Enron is the biggest energy trader in North 
America, operating a fleet of power plants and trading space on 
the nation's largest power and natural gas markets, the New York 
Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange, respectively. 
   Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, 
dropped 36 cents to $11.30. Southern California Edison lost 25 
cents to $12.50. 
   Some metals and mining shares were also down. Gold Resource 
Corp., which mines in Indonesia, fell 28 cents to $1.70. Asarco, 
the leading U.S. zinc and copper producer, gave up 27 cents to 
$4.45. 
   Viacom Inc. shares fell 3.3 percent to $39.54 after the 
studios for MTV, Nickelodeon and VH-1 said they would eliminate 
162 jobs to cut costs. Last week, MTV said it would eliminate 78 
jobs and cut 15 hours of programming a week. Viacom has taken a 
hit as investors pared back on expensive growth stocks. 
   Shares of SanDisk, the largest maker of flash-memory 
computer-disk cards used in digital cameras, digital music 
players, and data, dropped $4.02, or 21 percent, to $15.64. 
   So far this year, 2,000 technology stocks have come down 50 
percent or more.

Enron Says Indian Court Allows Pwr Proj Enabling Stake Sale

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power 
Company (DPC) said Tuesday the Bombay High Court rejected a petition by 
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board to suspend the National 
Thermal Power Corp. (Pursuant To The Foreign Investment Promotion 
Policy, 1992) Ltd.'s (MNPT) stake sale in DPC. 
Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in DPC. Its domestic business 
unit, Enron India, holds a 32% stake in DPC and is the maximum gainer 
on the stake sale, MSEB said.
Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in DPC. 
DPC has come under fire because of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory 
Commission's November 2000 decision to set electricity tariffs for 
domestic consumers that are significantly higher than tariffs set for 
industrial and commercial consumers. 
The commission, which sets tariffs for Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board, has capped electricity tariffs for domestic consumers at 6.51 
rupees per unit while for industrial consumers the rate is just 2.44 
rupees per unit. 
Dabhol's power project is the single largest foreign investment in India. 
The 740-megawatt plant sits in a special economic zone in the western 
Indian state of Maharashtra.

Enron's Indian Lender To Meet With Indian Govt Tue - Source

Dow Jones International News 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) will Tuesday meet with a 
representative of the country's federal finance ministry to discuss 
its ongoing Dabhol power project in India, a source close to the 
project told Dow Jones Newswires. 
The meeting follows last Friday's meeting of lenders to DPC, of which 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (DEW), Citibank NA (C), ABN Amro Rothschild 
(ABN) and the State Bank of India (P.BSB.P) participated. 
A spokesperson for Enron declined to confirm the meeting, and referred 
all calls to Enron India, the country's largest foreign investor in the 
project. 
Indian government sources told Dow Jones Newswires that the company's 
participation in the meeting, would serve as a sign that foreign 
investors' confidence in the government's ability to clear pending 
rhetoric on a range of issues including the Enron project, has been 
restored. 
The meeting follows Friday's meeting of DPC lenders in London, which was 
criticized by a Indian official as too little too late, since the 
conference was held hours after an Indian newspaper reported a 
government plan to renegotiate the terms of the power purchase 
agreement between DPC and the MSEB. 
The MSEB is the Indian utility that agreed to take 60% of DPC's power. 
Enron was forced to sell its stake in DPC after its huge international 
debt and the cost of building the plant proved too much to bear.

LOS ANGELES, Nov 1 (Reuters) - California's power grid operator said on 
Monday it had found no reason to resist the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission's order to refund $102 million to overcharged power users in 
February. 
But a consumer advocate who filed a complaint against the California 
Independent System Operator (ISO) said FERC may not have all of the 
figures.
