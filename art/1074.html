Here's a vending machine hack from Coco at My Little Green Piggy. You may remember this post where we featured Coco's home on the cheap. This time she's showing us how to hack a vending machine into a very cute little creature.

I made a vending machine hack when I was a kid and we used to hide in it and throw our money in. We had a good laugh, as well as some chocolate! It was great fun to make, though we almost were caught. Hehe! It makes me smile! Thank you for this share Coco!

Yes, our fridge is one of these, but we haven't used it in years. You have to put change in it to put a new roll in. If you're like us, you just give our neighbor the change that's in your soda cans.

I love that the kids can hide and take money from the machine. I didn't have a vending machine when I was a child, I suppose it's because there were no vending machines back then. But I can just picture myself sneaking in the vending machine to put a few coins and see what it's like inside and then quickly scurrying out.

I think this is a great little hack!

My grand daughter and her friend just made one of these, with the leftover change from my new year's candy. It was so cute they were having so much fun! My 13 year old son loves that new year's candy, so there was a lot of change.

I love it. I had a vending machine when I was a child and I thought that thing was so cool. I loved that I had my own money in it! :)

This is my favorite of the ones you've shared this year. I loved using vending machines in high school. Fun, cool and free. Your children are very clever and creative. Now if you can do this with a soda machine.

I need to pick up a soda machine so the kids can practice putting the coins in it.

You're right, I should have looked closely enough at the photos. When I saw the video, I didn't see the two little kids in the video and I didn't even know there was a video. :-(

Yea...they were hiding!

It's so adorable that your kids are already thinking about where their money goes. That is so precious. Thank you for sharing this idea with us!

This is great, I like your idea of putting the coins in too. I saw an online DIY the other day that you have the box with the coins and then you get an insert that you push in the box and change falls through a hole in the middle of the box and you remove the coins from the slots in the bottom of the box. I'm gonna try this with one of my coin boxes and it may be too small for coins, but maybe it will be great for my bottle caps. Maybe it will work to put a coin insert and bottle cap insert in and change and bottle caps fall through from the insert. I'll let you know, and I'll link back to this one on mine!

I love the way the machine opens so you can get inside of it!

Teri Sutherland

It's true, it does open up and you can crawl inside!

So much love.

This is a great idea for the kids. And I love that it keeps kids out of your room, you might find money in there instead of you know what :)...lol

Oh that's such a clever idea! I think it's a great way for kids to learn how to hide their money and also to learn about where money goes!

Sandy

What a great idea. We used to play in the vending machine at school.

Mary
