thinking about a career in law enforcement. There are many far more 
glamorous, more satisfying careers to choose from. 

Do you have any clue why a career in law enforcement would be 
considered glamorous? Do you think that being a police officer is 
going to be some invulnerable lark walking out of this courthouse 
with your last name emblazoned across your chest? 

The FBI needs your help in making this community safer. Are you aware 
that for every hour spent sitting around discussing things on the 
internet, your city is a little more vulnerable? We are dealing with 
some pretty savvy, hard-core criminals. 

If you are unwilling or unable to do your job, you will not be with 
this organization long. The FBI needs people who are dedicated, 
focused, and tough. 



I wanted to talk to you for a few minutes to explain the FBI's 
mission in general, and what we are doing in your community and your 
state. The Bureau is a pretty unique organization. 

We work throughout the world in partnerships with over 50 different 
law enforcement agencies. Our international activities involve partnering 
with foreign countries to find and bring to justice the most dangerous 
criminals. 

The FBI is unique in another way. The FBI isn't a military branch. We 
don't have any tanks or missiles or artillery. What we do have is an 
enormous responsibility. We are the only organization in the world 
charged with investigating domestic terrorism. We are the only 
organization in the world that works with international organizations 
to track and catch fugitives who travel internationally. We are 
supposed to be the focal point, and support center, for all domestic 
and international terrorism investigations. 

We are not the only agency in the world working on computer crimes. We 
are the only investigative arm of the government that specializes in 
finding and stopping high-tech criminals. 

This is important to you and your community. The FBI has over 300 
specialists. The Bureau is the leader in the investigation of computer 
crimes, financial crimes, and all sorts of white collar crime. 

I have been at the Federal Bureau of Investigation for over 11 years. 
I first started investigating computer crime in 1988. For six years I 
was the computer crime coordinator for the National White Collar 
Fraud Enforcement Association. I am proud to tell you that the 
investigators who worked with me at the NWCEA received 21 criminal 
indictments and 25 civil judgements. That is more than any other chapter 
in the history of that organization. 

The FBI is more important today than it has ever been before. We're 
fighting an increasing number of criminals who are using the Internet 
to commit their crimes. 

The very reason I wanted to talk to you today is that we have a very 
specific problem in your area. I am sure that you have heard about 
the case involving the World War 3 and the terrorist attacks on the 
United States. We are helping out in that investigation because we 
want to be able to trace the money back to the folks who ordered 
these operations. I know that this is one of the reasons why we have 
people monitoring the Internet and why the FBI is such an important 
part of the task force assembled to investigate this terrorist 
attack. 

As you know, we have a very long track record in fighting computer 
crime. We are the lead law enforcement agency in all crimes involving 
money. We are the leaders in computer fraud investigations, and we 
are the experts in international law enforcement. 

Unfortunately, when the media has referred to us as "cyber cops", 
that has generated fear and paranoia in the minds of the people who 
use the Internet. They know that we investigate Internet crimes. 
What they don't know is that the FBI investigates all types of crimes. 

We are not out to destroy the Internet. The FBI has very important 
work to do in this field. We would like to educate the public and 
make them more aware of the crimes that are occurring and the problem 
that is occurring with crimes committed against people using the 
Internet. 

We are a very proud organization. We take pride in our work. If you 
have any questions, or would like to discuss this further, please give 
me a call. 

Have a nice day. 

Thanks, 
Robert A. Schwebel, FBI
