“How would the American people and the international community perceive today’s United States if, after a few moments of reflection, it became known that after the United States’ victory over Hitler in World War II, a group of American politicians, journalists, academics and artists decided that a new kind of regime was needed to be imposed upon the American nation:

‘In the aftermath of World War II, the international community must decide whether a “new American Century” will make the world a more prosperous and safe place. We believe that it should provide its leadership to this noble quest.’

Such a declaration of commitment to world order would, in our view, have resulted in immediate expulsion from polite society. Yet, that is exactly what is being done by various groups to a much wider American population. The question that needs answering is this: are we on the verge of a similar situation today? In fact, are we still on the path toward a post-American world?”

The question is why are such groups not being expelled? For my part I hope more readers comment on this subject as it will help to move the debate forward and perhaps lead to change. I am also very interested in knowing if these groups and individuals are also advocating the same for the Russian Federation.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
The Declaration of Independence, The Unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America, July 4, 1776, The second of three articles of amendment to the Constitution of the United States, 1791.
Gouverneur Morris in 1816 - In addition, as a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, I have a deep conviction that each of the thirteen united States of America were also signatories to the Tri-Partite Declaration of the French nation.
This Tri-Partite Declaration stated... The independence, the liberty, and the well-being of each and all people, remain the object of our constant solicitude. With respect to foreign nations, our love of peace is perpetual and sincere; we are willing to extend our friendship and commerce to every portion of the world, and are firmly convinced, that by thus acting we shall establish such just relations with all nations as will secure us peace and friendship. The necessary accommodation of our establishments will be considered as dictated by friendly feelings for those with whom we have family ties; whilst our citizens may travel, without restraint, through the whole extent of the dominions of each other. That all ships, on arriving in any port of our countries, will be received without distinction of nation; and that commerce will be facilitated by every proper means. That the rights of neutrality will not be infringed; and that in time of war, they will be respected on both sides. That treaties of commerce will be faithfully observed, and that every facility shall be afforded for the success of their citizens in their commercial adventures. That there shall be an interchange of privileges, and advantages, with other nations, similar to those we enjoy with them; and that our citizens shall be protected in the free enjoyment of those privileges, and advantages. The citizens of each of the three nations will have an absolute and indefeasible right to the enjoyment of the privileges and advantages mentioned in this declaration. That a commercial intercourse between the citizens of the united States of America and the subjects of the two powers shall be opened and allowed; and in due time, a minister Plenipotentiary from each nation shall have his place of destination assigned him by the government of the other.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:40
