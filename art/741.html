it turned, 
it turned dark, it turned dark, it turned dark, it turned dark.

He saw the first of them there at the front, they look right at us, he was almost expecting there to be more, he thought maybe a second party was on their way, but 
he could see no other
he could see no other, he could see no other, he could see no other, he could see no other. 
He couldn't see any of them. He felt like someone was watching him, and he said "oh, here they come", 
and then all the heads poked up from the bottom of the trench, and all the eyes were open, and they started looking at us. It was pretty surreal. We just stood there, and 
we were totally alone, and they all walked up to the end, and stood. And, you know, they're not just sitting down, they're all facing towards the field 
and there was a dead dog on the field in the grass. And the Germans have been there before. And we kind of thought of that. And we all kind of turned to each other and went, "what is this?"
And it was kind of like the Germans, if they know they're being defeated, you know, they would say "if you're winning, stay at home. If you're losing, stay where you are, or face the German soldiers." 
And so, 
and that's pretty much what the Germans had done here. They'd stayed, you know, until the Germans had left the area, 
and the war had ended, or so we thought.
They stayed there, and all the, each one of those things stood up, stood up, just like a little, we were so startled at it. We could not believe that they had stayed there in the air raid 
that hit them, 
and they've stayed there in the open through the snow. And they're still there in the open, with their bodies. The smell of them.
And that was it, I looked at the lieutenant and said, "we have to go back out there." 
And I said, "how many do you think there are of them?" 
He said, "a bunch." And 
he said, "well, we'll go in the morning."
So, we went back in. I'm going to stop for a second, and let you look at the map again. 
We go back, I go back in with a lieutenant, Lieutenant, we have the dead body, with us, and we go back in to take a second look at the dead body, in the same trench, 
in which the Germans had been. This time, 
I'm pretty sure there were no other Germans in the trench. And we went out there, and there wasn't anything, and 
we went, we had had some contact with the Germans, the Germans had been on the other side of the field from where we were, we thought there had been no Germans, and, we 
didn't know how many there had been, we didn't know what they had done, we didn't know if the field had been mined, 
and we didn't know if, you know, in a situation like that, we would get involved with them. 
I had this thought, I thought about all the German prisoners I've seen, and I thought about what their bodies looked like, and I just had this, I said, I had to go back to this body. And 
I said, I said "Lieutenant, I think we should take that dog, and I want to move it off the field and bury it somewhere in town." 
We had that dog on the field in the open during the day, in the open, covered with flies, rotting there. You could see the flies moving around, and it was a stench there. I just 
thought about that, I thought about all the German prisoners I've seen, and I thought about what their bodies looked like, and I just had this, I said, I had to go back to this body. And 
I said, I said "Lieutenant, I think we should take that dog, and I want to move it off the field and bury it somewhere in town."

I said, I said "Lieutenant, I think we should take that dog, and I want to move it off the field and bury it somewhere in town." 
And the lieutenant goes, and he's standing up, I'm standing up, there's the dog, dead in the sun, but 
I'm looking at the bottom of the trench, and I see something, something just on the ground, and I see a lot of legs, and a lot of bodies, and there's a boot. The lieutenant is up here, 
and he's going to see the boot, so I just pick up, I got one leg, he was sort of standing to one side of the dog, and I pick up one leg. He turns to the right, you see the heel, and there's a boot on the other side of that leg. 
And I pick up the other leg. And we carry the dog off the field, and we carry it off to town and bury it.
I was going to say that that's probably the first and only thing that really scared me, because the way that it looks to me, the first time, when I got out there and I looked at them, it looked like the same thing. 
I could see these 
I could see these Germans coming out of the ground, as he said. The bodies going into the ground, no one had gone out to the German trenches, it was like the Germans had just disappeared.
So, 
they're not gone. That's what I was thinking, and I really had a feeling of horror. Because when I saw this, I just felt, "my god, this means the war is over!"
So, 
there were two things, one was that it really upset me. But the second thing, of course, was that we couldn't go to the field. We had to go back. 
And we went back to the trench, and this is what really happened. After the dog was moved, there were about ten, and I would say, more than twenty bodies. And 
the reason I say so, because when I had walked over, there had been ten, or something like that. 
And I don't know if they had been able to dig them out in the spring, and the way that we found the rest of them was because we were digging in another part of the field to, we 
had some sort of trouble with the machine gun. We had to replace the tripod 
we had to replace the tripod for the machine gun, which was on the parapet. And 
it was on a little mound, a hump. There were three of us who were on it, and all of a sudden, we heard this click, and we looked up, and we saw a German soldier, and he was looking at us, looking at us, 
not, 
not right at us, you know, kind of out of the corner of his eye. And 
I had, I looked back at my friends, who had been there with me, and I just 
couldn't understand why he would be doing that. He was dead.
He was lying there, and he had probably been up and shot at the front, and just fell to the ground. And 
we were there in his trench. And I just couldn't understand, I just didn't know what was going on, if he'd been injured and then 
left, and if he'd been wounded in the arm and crawled off to the field, because he'd been in a trench, 
and then crawled over to be in the field, which is what we thought at first. But then we found out that none of those things were right. 
And this time, there were about ten bodies. And it looked like this time, they had actually tried to dig him out. 
Now, I didn't actually see them dig him out, but there was a lot of digging around in the field. And what happened was that, when they came out, they didn't die in a line, the ones who were 
trying to dig him out, 
they died in a circle. And then the ones who had died on the field, as you saw before, the ones who had, whose bodies were covered with flies, the flies were on them, and their eyes were open, had been 
killed by the hand. That's what happened, 
the hand. They died of shock. They just died of what</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:58
