It is just my luck that it takes something like this to make me come to his defense. But this statement from the National Organization for Marriage is pretty much all anyone needs to know about his character. And for those of you who think it just takes a conservative Republican to be a bigot, you haven't spent much time around the conservative movement. They're a pretty racist, bigoted bunch. I mean I guess I shouldn't be surprised since this is the party of Lincoln. They're the party of the KKK, a terrorist organization in the history of our country. And that the hate group, the Ku Klux Klan was founded and led by none other than a Democratic president.

"It is just awful that the New York Times and the Washington Post, the New York Times is a disgrace, the Washington Post is a farce -- because they just make stuff up...They are a disgrace. It’s just a joke."

He is referring to the reports that he thinks are completely unfounded that he would like to see Obama's birth certificate (he's a Christian nationalist - so I guess that's OK). This came after he had called Obama a Communist.

"I just cannot understand the American people. I thought the American people were exceptional. It looks like they're in the same boat with the Iranians who have elections in Tehran. ...They've got freedom, liberty, human rights -- and it's hard to tell them apart from the Egyptians."

So he didn't win an election by majority of the people, so it's not true? Yeah, you know that whole majority rule thing. But I guess it's hard to let go of the old ways of thinking about political power, after all that's the basis of what this country is.

And as the article describes, Romney's "solution" to the gay rights problem.

"The Republican ticket is in serious trouble on this one. Romney had two real choices: 1) come out in favor of same-sex marriage (after having had his position described as "catering to the homosexuals"), or 2) make a public denouncement of homosexuality as a lifestyle, and thereby alienate the entire GLBT community. I think he made the right decision, but it was a near-impossible one."

You see, he can't do either. And he shouldn't even if he wanted to. And the reason I say he should leave it alone. If people want equality, the best way to make a person feel welcomed and accepted is to treat them with respect and kindness. It's also a great way to get what you want. I know this might sound like a weird thing to say to people who might be gay. I don't like seeing people treated poorly. But think of the world you would live in if everybody just treated everybody else like crap, and you were the only person treated nice. Would you still think it was a great place? Probably not.

I'm not a liberal or a Democrat, and yes I've been called a lot of names like that and worse for being a Conservative. But when you choose to join a party, you've chosen to be part of a group of like-minded people. And as Americans we value fairness and equality. It's in our founding documents, our Constitution, it's in our Declaration of Independence and our Preamble. It's a value we hold dear, and which we have fought to protect over and over again. It's why I have never once said I like America, but that I am a patriot.

So if you are a Republican, and you don't think gay rights are important, maybe just maybe that means you shouldn't be in the Republican party. And maybe that means you shouldn't be in the United States of America.

We had the great opportunity to hear the legendary Joan Baez live at the Womensfest this year. She started off the night with a few acoustic songs, and then went into the "Lark in the Morning" which she told us was one of her favorite songs, which she then dedicated to the memory of her dear friend and fellow folk singer. Joan has been a great inspiration to me for as long as I can remember, her music is part of what got me into folk music, which helped to build my music and writing career over the years, and which led me to my studies in Irish folklore. When my family was moving into a new home the first time a few years back, I realized that I had a lot of old vinyl albums and that my CD collection was pretty much on it's last legs. Then I found out she had a box of really old records in her basement, which is how I got my CD collection back. Anyway, here's a couple old posts about her:

Also check out this post which was published by Joan when I wrote her a letter that had her thinking about and looking at the meaning of peace.

She has had an amazing career and has inspired thousands of people from all walks of life. I've enjoyed reading her books and listening to her music. She has never sold out, and still has integrity in everything she does. And I will never stop being grateful to her for that. Thank you Joan Baez.

I have a special place in my heart for those who can move, shake, or stir people. Those who can get their audience off their feet, so to speak. They need to have the ability to be able to convey a mood through the music, and to be able to engage people and keep them involved. It’s amazing when a person is able to get an audience involved, and move them in all sorts of ways. This is not an easy task, and it requires a lot of skill and effort.

Some artists seem to have that talent, some don’t. What separates them from the rest of the pack? Well, I’ll tell you.

A person has to have passion to keep at it. An artist who has that passion and who puts themselves into their performance will be able to keep an audience that way. If they don’t have that passion, they’re going to lose their audience very quickly. That’s the kind of artist who moves people, shakes people, and</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:36
