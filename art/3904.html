I’m home by 6pm.

11:30pm – I open the bag of fried chicken. It’s dry and cold. “What the…” I think to myself as I look at the container. “The chicken is dry?” I check the container again. The only thing inside are tiny chicken parts.

“You didn’t put any grease in the container?” I asked the person who delivered the chicken. She told me “It’s dry already.” I check the container one more time. The container used to be filled with yellow grease but is now empty.

It’s dry and cold. I’m going to take these home and make dinner tomorrow.

It's dry. It's dry! I'm taking this home and make dinner tomorrow. (The chicken wasn't in this picture)

I have had this happen before and luckily I work from home, so I called the restaurant and told them what happened and asked them to tell the kitchen staff to stop putting their food in the containers because the containers never were greased, so they’d need to make sure to grease the containers this time.

I didn’t bother with any of that and just did it myself. I made sure I greased the container this time. I told the staff and the food delivery people to make sure to always grease the containers.

I can’t believe I’ve never had this problem before because I’ve ordered food delivery before. What were they thinking? No grease?

I also thought, “This can’t happen in real life”. Now I know it can.

Wow! I know a lot of people who are like that. Some of them work in restaurants!

That’s crazy! I’ve never had it happen but have heard that that’s why you always cook chicken before you freeze it, otherwise, when it thaws out it’s dry. That’s how they got all those freezie bags of chicken. I am not surprised that they didn’t fill your container with grease because that’s a big waste of time when you just need to grease the damn container. No worries – if you are at home and not craving for something really fast, it’s okay.

I’m not surprised the bag of fried chicken was dry! All I’ve ever heard about was to cook chicken before you freeze it…

The people I worked with didn’t know that the chicken would be frozen and then defrosted. You can say that I’m a smarty pants! 😉

I am always surprised that restaurants have no grease in the container. I’ve had dry chicken and the food delivery person was right there saying no grease? I just never thought twice about it.

I always take it for granted that everything will be grease in a restaurant. I will check the containers though. But, I always look for the yellow grease before I order fried chicken. Now, that is gross.

That is disgusting. One time I sent my husband a chicken with no grease, and it had a huge fly in it, but it could have been the delivery person. It’s a good idea to check your food if you are ordering.

That is sad that this happened to you. I have only had dry fries and chicken once or twice before.

I feel like if people are serious about blogging and making some money, and they are going to buy an item like that, then they should be careful and take care of their customers. Just one time you could see how some chicken would be dry. That was the first time it happened to me.

I just don’t understand how people can be sloppy and inconsiderate. People shouldn’t complain about things like this on social media. In other countries they would have them arrested.

I agree about them being inconsiderate and lazy. However, I wanted to show that sometimes it happens no matter how much people are taught.

Yes, it really does seem so much more expensive than it needs to be. I had a friend who worked there. I’m sure he didn’t want the food to be thrown away. But, I think that the restaurant may not have been ready for delivery.

Yes, some people are just careless and lazy. When I worked in retail I would always ask if the workers could grease my plastic containers. You shouldn’t have to do that when you are shopping, though. I’m glad that you told the restaurant to make sure they grease their containers.

The worst I have seen is when I have been eating at home and all of a sudden the house is filled with flies. Some people don’t even think about that or care that their food is making their house filthy.

It is really sad that people can be so careless. They don’t take food safety seriously. You shouldn’t have to ask for someone to grease your containers.

I have to admit that I’ve never had a problem with the delivery service. However, some restaurants have a problem. And, I don’t understand it. I thought that they were trying to save money by not filling the containers with grease.

I am sorry that you had that problem! I always thought delivery places would have grease on them because of how people work and stuff. I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened to me, too.

I’ve never had it happen to me, but my husband works in a busy restaurant and he’s always hearing about how people get dry fried chicken or something like that.

That really is stupid. I can’t believe that they don’t put grease in the containers. Hopefully they will find a way to fix this problem.

I have had dry chicken and donuts several times. I always wonder how restaurants get away with it. But, it’s not that big of a deal. It’s definitely not something we would get a lot of upset over. Thanks for sharing your story and bringing to light how people can be so careless.

That’s so strange that they didn’t grease the container. I’ve never had a problem with dry chicken or anything, but I’ve been lucky. I also think that people should make sure to check their containers before they give them to a delivery driver.

I can’t believe that the restaurant didn’t put grease in the container. It’s not a big deal because it happens and they wouldn’t be able to change that now, but I agree that it could be a reason for a lawsuit.

I don’t know about ordering frozen chicken. I’ve never had that happen to me before, but I’m still not going to do that.

I’m not surprised that the person who delivered the food didn’t fill the container with grease. I can’t imagine doing that.

The most inconvenient problem that I have had was with the pizza I had from a restaurant. I don’t like it when food becomes dry.

Your delivery story is kind of funny. I guess some people really are inconsiderate. You are definitely right. It’s not something that most people would be mad about, but we have to see how this works out.

That’s so terrible that this happened to you. I have never had it happen to me before, but it’s really awful when it happens. I always check out the containers before I order. But, I agree with you that this could be a reason for a lawsuit. I’m so glad that you found a way to make the pizza work.

I’m surprised to hear that the chicken was left out and not greased! It’s definitely important to check the containers before you eat it or order it. I hope that you will be able to still eat it!

I have seen something like that at a restaurant. I’m glad that you didn’t order anything else from that restaurant. It’s definitely not worth it to get a really bad food experience.

Dry food really is bad, but I can understand if the person who delivered didn’t have grease on them because it’s an excuse and people get really irate about it.

It’s awful. I can’t believe that they are that careless! Thankfully, there is no way they could sue you because they were wrong in the first place, but what if there was a lawsuit. You might lose a lot of money.

I can understand how someone can do this on purpose. It’s a waste of good food when food is on its way to your doorstep.

I’ve had my share of dry things too, but it depends on what and</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:40
