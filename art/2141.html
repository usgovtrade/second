Instead, it was called the National Information Infrastructure (NII) until the name was changed to Internet in the early 1990s, while the term "Trojan Horse" became more frequently used among computer users. During the Vietnam War, a similar term was coined as "Trojan War", to refer to sabotage using decoys or misinformation to draw enemy forces into an ambush.

The United States National Security Agency began to develop automated information warfare software programs called Trojan Horses in 2001, although they were never deployed for tactical use.

MUD 
During the Cold War, some MUDs were known as "trolling fleets", in reference to an anti-submarine detection device of the same name. The nickname apparently derives from the idea that some MUDs were "fishing for submarines", using their knowledge of the submarine's communications as bait to lure submarines to surface. This metaphor is based on fishing, because information can be used as bait to lure, and entrap, other people.
