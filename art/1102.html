The former Newcastle United trainee has been hampered by injuries this season, and is currently out with a foot injury.
Winslow is a 6ft 5ins central defender, who can play as either a central defender or a right back.
The 25-year-old has made over 50 appearances for the Magpies since breaking into the first team in 2010.
Celtic are likely to spend some time in England this week.
Forrest has been in fine form this season, scoring 21 goals for the Hoops, including four in his last three games.
Winslow was an academy star at Newcastle, and progressed to the reserves and first team, but his progress was hindered by numerous injuries.
Winslow has made only two appearances for Celtic this season, both in the Europa League. He made his debut on September 27th against Hapoel Be’er Sheva, coming on as a 90th minute substitute for Gary Mackay-Steven.
Celtic are keen to beef up their squad ahead of the second half of the season, which includes a second round tie in the Scottish League Cup, as well as an opening-day Champions League game against Anderlecht.
The 26-year-old has made over 100 appearances for the Saints since signing from Coventry in 2010, and has spent this season on loan at Norwich.
Shrewsbury Town are pleased to announce we have launched a new website at www.shrewsburytown.net, with a focus on helping supporters keep up-to-date with all things Town.
We have a brand new content hub for news and views from the club, plus exclusive interviews with players and officials.
Meanwhile supporters will also have their say on any topic via the blog, while video highlights of each game will be available after they've been shown on Sky Sports.
The official Twitter account @ShrewsWeb has also been merged with our new website so there will be one place for all Town news.
We hope you enjoy the new website - see you in the summer!
