"God, Lord, Buddha, Muhammad, Buddha", or what-not. There is no
way to use one specific religious terminology that will be universal and
have any religious merit without people taking offense. So in my opinion,
there isn't a religion in the world that you can choose to not take offense
to when you're using an inherently exclusive religious tradition. You can
take the words out, but you will always find someone who doesn't like it
because their religion is exclusive. Even though the religious people will
try to argue with you about how exclusivity is part of their religion,
they're just the ones who make the religion exclusive. The rest of the
religious people don't even know they're doing it, so just let them be.

I agree. I don't mind if you refer to a spirit (as in: "God is great" in
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b1qkX7r5i0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b1qkX7r5i0)
) but I'd recommend not to mix it with religious topics unless it's the only
possible term for the audience.

I can respect that. I'd just point out that in this case, it's referring to a
spirit of love and non-judgmental forgiveness. At this point, it's a non-
religious concept, and so is as OK as anything else. But if that ever changes
and becomes a religious concept, I might change this a bit.

Thanks. This is very helpful information to pass on to my father-in-law who
has cancer, after he asked my opinion in our email chain. He asked if he
should stop with chemotherapy and radiation, or go for surgery. I said that
it's not the medical thing that's important, but his own emotional wellness
that's important. This gave him a number to call.

I'll send an email later, and let you know what happens.

If anyone here has experience with using ketamine for cancer, I have a family
friend who needs to know if it is a viable option. I'm very aware of the
legalities surrounding it, but would love some information to offer him if he
ever comes to me asking for such a thing.

Any and all input is much appreciated. Thank you.

Cancer is a horribly cruel and arbitrary disease. As someone who has survived
it, here's my perspective:

1\. Cancer is much more complicated than it looks. Cancer doesn't have a cure,
but we have cures for many other medical conditions which result from a similar
genetic or environmental factor. While certain cancers can be prevented (e.g.
cervical cancer or some kinds of liver cancer), we're pretty far from being
able to stop/prevent most types of cancer. I know this for a fact as my wife
has a cousin (sister's sister) with ovarian cancer, and his 5 year old is at
high risk for brain cancer.

2\. While I'd love to give you some advice and a miracle cure to fight cancer,
I think most "cures" for cancer only exist in movies and in scientific
journals/papers, and have not been tested or adopted in common practice. In
general, people want to believe in cures and magical shortcuts.

3\. In general, I think cancer patients should take a "wait and see" approach.

4\. I wish cancer patients the best of luck.

5\. If you or anyone you know is fighting cancer, tell them to find an
understanding and patient support group. My family and I found a good support
group at a nearby University, and it was a wonderful asset.

Thanks. There are a lot of us out there (in HN and elsewhere) who have been
there.

I'm thinking that if a cancer spreads, its likely that the immune system is
out of whack. Is this correct? If so, are there treatments that are immune-
modulating that can help, or can chemo help to shore it up?

I have Cancer, it is what it is, so instead of me stressing about if its doing
what it should I will do what I can do.

Right now, I have a bad case of the flu.

I am sick, cant sleep and cant get out of bed, but, guess what I am doing? I
am playing catch up on all the technical education material for my current
job, the one that pays me bills! I know a lot of stuff about this, enough to
pass it, but they are hiring so I am taking the opportunity and taking them
over.

I have made myself sick, but I am using my body against the sickness. I have
to get up, it takes about an hour after I am feeling better, but it works. I
will get better.

The article is a little too much biased in favour of chemo, especially about
some studies, but there are some good comments there on where doctors can
improve.

And is not contagious.

It is very tough to see someone go through it, it's very hard to put yourself
in their shoes.

Although some people may have the privilege to be financially stable from day
one of diagnosis and can afford the best treatments for them to improve there
chances.

I would not just focus on how I could help someone, as in I don't care how I
can help them. As long as they don't need my help I am fine.

"And that's really it, when it comes down to it - because really, cancer is
simply a matter of time. Cancer doesn't get cured, it gets controlled.
Anything else is propaganda."

Cancer is not a disease but a collection of symptoms like any other sickness.
Its better to accept death to be certain of cure.

You're not listening to what the author was saying. He's not saying the cure
for cancer is as simple as accepting it, he's saying that it's all about the
patient, not the disease, which is 100% correct.

A cancer diagnosis at age 34 is very likely something that is life altering.
You go from being just another individual, doing your own thing and being part
of the larger community and life - you are a part of it.

There is no "treatment" that can come and save you from a medical prognosis
that has you only having 1-3 years to live. No way. Unless you are already
famous and famous enough to get the treatment of a lifetime because a
presidential or senatorial blessing would come with it, etc. There is no
miracle, treatment or procedure that can save your life from the ravages of a
terminal cancer diagnosis.

This is just the truth. You may as well get comfortable with it and get used
to it. It's not the end of the world, but it's a hard truth that people really
want to avoid and avoid and avoid. Cancer is terminal, you are going to die.
There is no way around it, and everyone should really face the fact that they
are going to die from a terminal illness and learn to live with it and learn
to make the most out of the days and months and years they have left. People
go through such hell because they are afraid of the truth of their own dying
that they seek to avoid it. Well, that's a waste of energy. It's real, let's
get to it and deal with it. If I had cancer I'd be pretty fucking angry at
everyone out there who is constantly using the excuse "oh don't be so upset,
it's not the end of the world." That, my friend, is bullshit and should be
addressed by anyone who insists on using it. Cancer, like it or not, is the
end of the world. And it should be dealt with that way and not sugar coated or
made light of because it's a horrific thing to deal with.

When the body starts to fail, there are a ton of unpleasant things that can
and will happen to the body and a lot of them are unpleasant to experience. If
you want to deal with the reality, get over it and get on with it. What kind
of selfish and mean spirited person wouldn't want their friends and family to
deal with things as they are rather than try to soften the blow? How kind of a
nasty and mean spirited person would try to ease their own demise.

That's the truth, and it is the very reason why people avoid cancer diagnosis
so very much. If cancer were completely</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:55
