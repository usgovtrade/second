Now. Or I 
will kill you."

The threat was made with a calm determination which was in itself
threatening, and the girl fell back with her face aghast, thinking she
would certainly be killed if she did not give in. It was hard to know
what to do. She had promised to deliver the prisoner--it was all her own
doing, at the first she had only to deny everything. But that was not
what the king wanted, not what the boy expected. She looked up at his
face and saw that his mouth was set like iron and his eyes were staring
into hers with a fierceness that was terrible. Still she hesitated.

"What is the use of all these threats, since we know they are not true,
since we know that what the king says is false? Release me, I say, now."

"He is my prisoner, madam," the king replied with dignity. "Let him be
put in the Tower until morning."

Then the girl in her turn began to argue. The king might have his
prisoner and keep him in the Tower for the night, but he must not go to
the girl's rooms. She argued for some time, but she knew she could not
defeat his lordship. She was not strong enough. At last she saw that she
must yield.

"Well, sir, it is only one night," she cried. "At least I have not done
you an injustice. I will go and promise that I will put your wishes into
effect."

"Very well," said the king.

The king had no time to see any more of this interesting and, to him,
unpleasantly interesting scene, but he heard that the girl who had been
dreaded for the last few days was actually going to her mistress's
bedside. It was all-important that he should have a talk with the girl,
and the next time he was at Carlisle she was brought out before him and
questioned.

The king saw she was frightened and he was very angry.

"I will lock you up and keep you in the Tower," he said; "it is only for
a few days that you have gone against your trust."

"But, sir," she said, "I shall come into your presence whenever you
command."

"You will come into my presence at such times as I order it," he said.
"I will take steps to prove that you are true to your trust."

She submitted to that indignity quietly, and was soon back with her
mistress. There was a good deal of talk between the two ladies about the
wonderful recovery which Mrs. Herbert was making and, in the evening,
the king sent for her. He congratulated her on her rapid recovery, and
said he was now convinced she would live. He told her that her friend
the Countess of Essex was staying at his house and he hoped she might
possibly be permitted to go there for a little while, as his daughter
and Lady Essex were so well acquainted, and perhaps Mrs. Herbert might
like to have her company. Mrs. Herbert was delighted to be asked, and
promised that she would go on the very next day. As a matter of fact,
she had never gone anywhere since the morning on which she was first
taken ill.

That evening, when the king came into his wife's bedroom, he found her
sitting up in bed, and reading a very pretty new book which the queen
had just finished and which she had sent to her. He had a letter which
he wished to give her, which had come from his brother-in-law, the Duke
of York. His daughter Mary had at once written to the duke, asking him
to speak to her mother and tell her she could have no illusions about
her sister, if she allowed her to treat one of the king's guests in that
way. The king was sure that she was angry about it, as she had certainly
been very ungracious and unpleasant in the past.

"There has been a letter from the duke for you, madam," he said.

"A letter!" cried the queen. "My dearest brother sending me a letter!
What is his letter like?"

"I am sure he will not be offended at being called by that name," the
king said; "he must call himself your brother now that you are a widow,
so it seems strange to me he does not call you mother."

"He has not written such a strange letter as that, I'm sure," the queen
replied. "There is nothing very bad in his letter. I should hardly care
to show it to you before you have seen it. I can hear what it is about
from the contents, even if you had not read it."

"Perhaps I had better hear the contents too," the king said; "so that
there shall be no disputes as to what the king thinks you ought to do.
It would be as well for me to have a copy, if possible, and I do not
know if there is any copy which is the counterpart of the other."

"I am sure I have the original here," the queen said, and she took a
manuscript book from under her pillow and handed it to her husband.

The king read it through with one eye on his wife, who stared at him
with a look of curiosity and surprise. She was as angry as ever when he
had finished. She did not understand why her lord should wish her to go
to the queen, and, even if it were true, why the king was so opposed to
her going. The king thought, for a moment, that she would actually
challenge him, but he remembered in time that he was not a common person
and could not be called into the king's presence with no reason given.

"I am sure I did not say," he said at last, "I am sure it was a mistake
of mine, when I said the letter which you have is so bad that I had
better see it, as the contents could not possibly be agreeable."

"Perhaps," the queen said, "you will wish me to say that you did not
want me to read what was in it, which I suppose would be the case if it
were indeed anything so bad, and then you would not have to see it."

"The contents are not so bad as you might fancy," the king said; "but
they are as I have said, not quite nice, and I think the whole thing is
wrong for you. But as you have sent your orders you must do as you wish
and as you are too ill for anything else, I shall certainly do as you
would wish me."

The queen lay back in her bed, when he was gone, and laughed until the
tears ran down her cheeks.

"I will write a letter to him," she cried. "I will ask him why he does
not come to see me, for he surely knows that I am a widow. I have never
seen him since he was so unfortunate as to kill my husband."

"You have never seen him since he killed your husband!" the king cried.
"My dear, you should not speak of it in that way. You should never even
remember it. If the duke knew you were speaking in that way of his
brother--and for his sake, poor man, you should be very kind--I do not
think he could bear it. You should always be glad to remember him as a
beautiful young man, to whom you owe everything. He is not much older
than you are, he has toiled and suffered in order to defend his
country, as well as to pay for your support. And so, my dear, since he
is like a son to me, and indeed he is a good deal like a son to me, I
cannot bear that you should speak of him in any way but well."

"There is a deal more in it than you think," the queen said, and she
wrote two letters to her lord. One of them was to say that he must visit
her. The other was to explain how she had seen all his belongings.

The first letter to the duke said that the queen was much better and
would be fit to come to her lord again as soon as she felt a little
stronger, but she was afraid to undertake any long journey. She was
afraid to disappoint the duke, and she would be better able to do it
when she saw him and he might have a better opinion of her. As for the
letter of explanation, she was more inclined to burn it, and so keep
every thing as it was. But, as she had no opportunity of burning it,
she wrote to her lord's brother, the Lord Chamberlain, that she would
give her lord his freedom when he came again.

The duke sent his own reply and, if it had not been for the king's
kindness, I think the queen would have sent for the Earl of Essex to
help her to break off the match. It was a sad disappointment to have to
do with so unambitious a husband as she had married. He did not know
what to do. Her letters made him so</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:02
