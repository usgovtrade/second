This video game was a follow up to the earlier Rally Cross video game and was initially released on the Commodore Amiga, but was later ported to the Atari ST.

At the time of release this game had a good reputation for being one of the best rally games available at the time.  Although this was not the first Rally game, it was the first to be realistic in that it had proper car damage and you could get towed off the road by other cars - this is also where the "rally" in the title comes from.

The game was a very faithful adaptation of a well-known event at the time, the Prescott Rally in Arizona which regularly has participants such as Bob Sharp and Mark McMillin.

It is also possibly the only game which ever allowed you to play as Dan Gurney. Dan is infamous for ignoring safety at rallies and once raced a modified MG Midget off a cliff in California in a famous road race. This game let you get off the race track in a similar way but in a more controlled and safer way. If the car gets to the edge it simply veers off track into a ditch, doing damage to your car and hurting your rating.

A sequel was released in 1991 entitled Championship Rally USA

The music for the game was provided by Andy Gray, who is perhaps better known as a BBC TV presenter.
