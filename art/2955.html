A political memoir, A Persona Non Grata is the first book by former U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy.

The book was written by Kennedy in order to respond to the accusations of Senator Daniel P. Moynihan that Kennedy's life had been "boring". By the time it was published, Moynihan had stepped down from his position, and Kennedy had lost his seat in the United States Senate.

Synopsis
In his book, Kennedy writes about his many experiences during his time in office, both in public life and in his private life. He also writes about "how the public and the press misunderstand me."

It includes anecdotes of his personal relationships and his children and grandchildren. 

It also includes stories of his visits to the White House and how his political rivals had mistreated him.

Publication history
The book was originally published in 1996. It was republished in 2000, and in 2005 in a different format.
