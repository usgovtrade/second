Suddenly, he found himself flying up in the air and spinning around and around with a huge, fat, hairy bear!

It was very scary, until he noticed that it was actually Quiggly in bear form!

While Quiggly was flying, he also noticed that his body was glowing, and he was spinning in circles at a high speed!

But suddenly, Quiggly's body stopped spinning and his body flashed into a normal Quiggly bear-shape.

Quiggly the bear, having been transformed from a real Quiggly, flew off into the air until he reached the other end of the school.

Then Quiggly transformed back into a real Quiggly and then walked up to the school gate.

He had to be very quiet as he walked to avoid a chance of being caught by a janitor.

When Quiggly arrived at the hallway of the school, he opened the door and went straight into the classroom.

As the door opened, Quiggly could see that the curtains were drawn and his two human mates were fast asleep.

Quiggly decided not to wake them up and just went straight to the back of the class, to where he knew Mr. Withers kept his special items.

He could tell that the janitor had been rummaging around in the trunk when Quiggly had first arrived at school that day.

But this did not matter at all, as Quiggly did not need to worry about Mr. Withers anymore.

Quiggly just climbed up on top of the desk and searched for the right key.

Quiggly, having found the correct key, unlocked the padlock.

Quiggly lifted the heavy trunk open and began to sift through the items in it.

As he sifted through the items, Quiggly looked at them from time to time.

He decided that he did not want to disturb his two human friends, so he decided to take whatever items he saw and hide them in the locker.

After he had looked through all of the items in the trunk, Quiggly decided that he would take the only thing of importance - the large gold ring with three large diamonds on it.

This gold ring was known to be Mr. Withers's treasure.

As Quiggly turned to go, he was suddenly caught by two strong hands, which had appeared out of nowhere.

Quiggly tried to escape, but he was caught by a strong arm and the hand locked around his neck.

It was then that Quiggly was able to make out the face of the man who was attacking him.

It was the janitor, Mr. Withers!

"AHHHH!!" screamed Quiggly as he went into a panic mode.

Mr. Withers finally caught Quiggly and held him in his tight grasp.

"I'll teach you for you taking the ring out of my office", Mr. Withers replied in a cold and calm voice.

"And we'll be talking to your two human friends about what happened tonight.

I know you've been using that key all day.

And there's something else I know, Quiggly.

Your name is not Quiggly!" Mr. Withers continued as he gripped Quiggly tighter around the neck.

"And we'll soon be finding out what your real name is!"

Mr. Withers suddenly began to spin Quiggly around and around, until Quiggly could barely see.

Quiggly tried to yell for help, but he could barely breathe because of the tightness of Mr. Withers's grip.

Then Mr. Withers suddenly stopped the spin, releasing Quiggly.

Quiggly then landed on his back on the floor, staring up at Mr. Withers's face.

Quiggly could hardly believe his eyes as he saw Mr. Withers's face change.

Quiggly began to scream for help, but Mr. Withers did not stop him this time.

Mr. Withers, instead, raised his arm and gave Quiggly a swift slap across the face.

Quiggly, in his daze, looked up at Mr. Withers.

And now, Mr. Withers looked exactly like Quiggly!

Mr. Withers looked down at Quiggly and spoke again.

"You will tell no one, and you will never again come to school on this Earth, do you understand?" Mr. Withers said in a strange, high, loud voice.

Quiggly now began to cry.

"Please, Mr. Withers, I will do anything you want, anything!"

Quiggly told Mr. Withers that he had no memory of how he became Quiggly, but that he would follow him forever if he would just help him.

Mr. Withers smiled at Quiggly's words.

"Now that we are on that subject, Quiggly.

You will now tell me how you became a rabbit, because I do not think it was a very nice trick that you played on your human friends."

Quiggly looked up at Mr. Withers with a frown.

"A-A trick? I-I do not understand." Quiggly then told Mr. Withers about the day he became the rabbit.

Quiggly told Mr. Withers about what had happened since the beginning.

It was a very strange day for Quiggly.

He first found the mirror in the woods that day.

Then when he looked into it, a man appeared.

This man, of course, had been Mr. Withers!

Quiggly now told Mr. Withers that he wanted to go back home.

Mr. Withers said that he could not yet let him go back home because Quiggly could not control what happened when he looked into the mirror.

Quiggly told Mr. Withers that he did not want any more of the same things to happen to him that had happened before.

"Mr. Withers, I am so sorry for what happened to me.

But I would really like to go back home now." Quiggly told Mr. Withers that he would do anything Mr. Withers asked of him if he would help him.

Quiggly then asked if he could get a promise from Mr. Withers.

"Okay," Mr. Withers replied in a stern voice.

"But what is it that you want?" Mr. Withers asked, sounding a little puzzled.

"I want my real name, Mr. Withers."

Mr. Withers was taken aback by this, and began to go over the story again about how he had caught Quiggly.

Then Mr. Withers seemed to find Quiggly's demand strange, as it was the first time he had even heard of Quiggly's real name.

"But why do you want your real name?" Mr. Withers asked again.

"Because then we can go home, Mr. Withers.

I just want to be home now, Mr. Withers.

That's all I really want."

"And you will obey all of my instructions, Quiggly?"

Mr. Withers asked.

"I promise."

Mr. Withers then let Quiggly go.

"You must tell no one about this incident," said Mr. Withers.

"Now go home!"

Mr. Withers then released Quiggly and Quiggly ran home as fast as he could.

On the way home, Quiggly had many thoughts.

Quiggly was very pleased that Mr. Withers had allowed him to go home, and Mr. Withers had allowed him to live a normal life.

Quiggly wondered how Mr. Withers was able to change forms into what Quiggly knew.

Mr. Withers's description of what was around Quiggly when he looked into the mirror was very clear.

Mr. Withers's description of Quiggly was that he was looking into the mirror when Quiggly fell out of his hiding place.

But Quiggly had looked into the mirror and seen himself as a rabbit, and Quiggly was not in Mr. Withers's presence.

Quiggly decided that he could only assume that he could change forms when he was not around Mr. Withers.

When Quiggly got home, he decided to take a look in the mirror again.

It had been raining all night and it was still raining, but Quiggly was not at all worried about that.

He looked into the mirror, and there he was, standing all by himself.

Quiggly went over and sat down in front of the mirror to see if he could turn back into a human.

And for some reason, the rabbit in</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:32
