"Alex?"

"What is it, Lazarus?" I said to myself. "Alex?"

"Alex."

"Hmmm. Who are you?"

I scratched my head and opened my eyes wide.

"It is not very important."

"If you say so."

The room was dark. And cold. And empty. I got up. I reached

down to my bed. The sheets were all wet. My head started

hurt and I felt nauseous. I pulled the sheet from my eyes and

the light, very dim, was from the small light over the door.

I went back to the table. I checked my mobile. It was dead.

I went outside. It was very dark and cold. The night was beautiful

with all the stars.

I went back in and lit the room. The sun was about to rise.

I took a cold shower. I cleaned my face. I got dressed. I went

out again.

I needed to make a phone call. I went back to the hotel and

pulled out the piece of paper with Alex's number. I opened

his phonebook. Then I went back to my room. I dialed Alex's

number. He answered after two rings.

"Who is it?"

"It's Alex."

"Oh. I was just about to call you, Mr. Alex."

"Please, call me Lazarus."

"Okay."

"I think we can work together."

"Okay."

"I need your help. I have a lead. I will need your help."

"Is this a prank?"

"No."

"Okay."

"Now I want you to call him and tell him you are investigating

the case on his behalf."

"Ok."

"We will talk tomorrow. Call me around ten."

"Okay. Where?"

"My office. My phone number is . . ."

"Okay."

I hung up.

I smiled. It was getting better. Everything seemed to be just

fine. I called the reception and asked for a wakeup call for five.

"We don't have room service or any phone

around five. But you can eat here."

"Okay. Thank you."

"See you tomorrow, Mr. Sklansky."

"Right."

I slept again. I dreamed of a hot air balloon. I dreamed of a little

bearded man. I dreamed of lots of money. I dreamed of a big car.

I dreamed of a hot beach. And I dreamed of a wonderful girl.

The dreams mixed together in my head. And they made me sleepy.

And I slept again.

I slept until noon.

It was a beautiful day. I walked and rode the elevator up to

my floor. I didn't need a key. I had the key.

I went down to my car. I drove around the block. I saw a little

store next to the parking garage. I went in and had a hot dog.

It was a little lonely out there. I figured I had an hour

to kill. I went back to the parking lot.

I found a little place where I could listen to the radio. It was

nearby. I turned on the radio. I could listen to the sports.

It was easy listening. My radio was an iPod.

But the announcers were irritating. I switched to a station that

played music with guitar and drums. I turned it up a little

louder. Then I got really tired. So I took the blanket from my

car and stretched out in the backseat.

It was a great place. I didze off for a while.

I woke up when I was jolted with a painful sound. I thought

it was a bomb. I lifted up. My blanket was on fire. I looked

up. I saw a red and orange fire, burning around my head. I

lifted the blanket. My radio was on fire. I was on fire.

I jumped out of my car. I screamed and ran. I ran into the

parking lot. I got on the ground. I tried to stop the fire.

The fire got into the back of my pants. I was burning. I

couldn't feel any pain.

Finally, the fire went out. It stopped raining. I was covered

with soot. I could hardly breathe. My shirt was all torn.

My head hurt. I didn't even know where I was. I looked

around. I was next to my car.

And I was alone. I was sopping wet.

I got up and began to walk back to my apartment. I took

the stairs down to the parking lot. I was freezing and in a

hurry. I had to call the fire department. I would freeze to

death. I went into the alleyway. I was still trembling. It

was so cold. The sweat was dripping down my head. My

shoulders were trembling. I could hardly move.

I lifted my head. I reached into my pocket and took out my

wallet. I took a cigarette from my shirt pocket. I rolled it

between my fingers. I looked around for a place to put it

out. I remembered the trash can next to my building. I

walked to the cans and threw the cigarette inside. I felt

satisfied. I walked back to my building. I stopped at my door

and knocked. I was sweating. My keys were in my pocket.

They were soaked. They fell out and dropped on the sidewalk.

I walked over to them and picked them up. I unlocked my

door and went in. I closed the door. I was soaking wet. I

had my shoes in my hand. They were heavy. They made a

heavy sound when I stepped into my apartment.

I wanted to change my clothes. I was soaked and freezing. I

was in a terrible mood. My stomach was full of food. I was

wired. I knew that I had to do something.

I took a shower and washed off the soot. I went to bed.

I smoked two cigarettes. I felt better. I fell asleep. And I

dreamt of good things. It was my lucky day.

Darlene was very excited. She got up early. She made breakfast

for me. I felt guilty. I didn't want to eat her cooking.

We got dressed. We left the house. She didn't want me to go

back to the office.

"Look at me. I am a kid again."

"Okay. What would you like to do?"

"Let's go to the park. And do some more walking. We will walk

through the park. It will help us think."

"Okay."

We rode the elevator and got out. It was sunny. There were a

few people in the park. The trees were in full bloom.

"You are not as fat as you used to be."

"Thank you."

We walked and looked at the beautiful flowers. We laughed and

kissed. And talked. We didn't talk business. We went back

to the house. Darlene made lunch. We ate in the dining room.

It was good. And then we went back to the park. It was hard
