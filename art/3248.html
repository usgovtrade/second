Caballero (2006)

Awards and nominations
In addition to his writing, Sellers received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a Grammy Award and two Tony Awards for co-writing the music and lyrics to Dear Mr. Wonderful (1993). Sellers also received the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (2005).  Sellers received the Grammy Award for the "Best Compilation Soundtrack For Motion Pictures, Television Or Other Visual Media" for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

Personal life 
Sellers married actress Judy Carne in 1959, and they remained together until her death in 1992. The couple had two children, Samantha and Thomas. Samantha is a singer, songwriter and actress who performed in theater and television productions, including a recurring role in the television series Party of Five. In October 2006, Sellers publicly admitted that he had been living with cancer, had been in remission for years, but was now living with the disease again. He stated that "My blood cell count is quite high. The reason I am not coming out and saying that I have cancer is because it would be too cruel to the people who have been really great to me."

Death
On 7 April 2010, Sellers died at his home in Beverly Hills, California, from pancreatic cancer at the age of 84. He was survived by his partner of 43 years, David Miner.

Legacy
The British Library announced in November 2013 that it had acquired the archive of Sellers and Carne in preparation for their film on the 1960s partnership between the pair, to be titled Love Me Tender.
