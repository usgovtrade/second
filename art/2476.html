"This is a one-time offer." "Don't you walk away from me, agent." "Yes." "Hey." "I'll be waiting for you right here." "Go ahead and go." "That's what you're good at." "Hey, you did good." "You think I was gonna let you walk away?" "Not from me." "Oh, really?" "Go ahead and run, you little son of a bitch." "God!" "Jesus, T!" "Come on." "T." "It's already been like 45 minutes." "Just chill." "You think you're gonna get any of this?" "It's all mine." "The guy didn't know the difference." "I got the guy to think he was getting a bj from G-Girl, not from..." "Not from..." "Giganta." "Giganta, with a capital "G."" "Yeah, I don't get it, man." "I mean, a fox, a chicken and a pig walk into a bar and then what happens?" "I don't know." "You know, we have to think alike here, man." "I mean, this is a tough one." "I mean, a talking chicken?" "I'm having trouble with it, but I think that we..." "I gotta get back to the bureau, but I think that we need to keep this between ourselves, you know?" " For now." "Yeah." " Yeah, okay." "So, what do you say, huh?" "It's gonna be okay." "I've got an idea." "Did you get them?" "Is it time?" "Yeah." "Quiet, quiet!" "Let's see what you can do." "You, roll them!" "What was that noise?" "Are you okay?" "Wha...?" "No." "Oh!" "G-Girl!" "BRIK:" "Put the gun down!" "F-Feds!" "Drop it!" "There she is!" "Grab her!" "Get her!" "COOK:" "Shoot her!" "Uni 7 going down." " Uni 7 going down." " Bingo." "Uni 7 going down." "Uni 7 going down." "Who are you?" "G-Girl, you made it!" "Yeah!" "What up?" "Welcome to the party." "Yeah, we heard about you, G. You're like the X-Men of busting ghosts." "Yeah, you busted my ghost." "You busted my handcuffs." "Nice work." "Thank you, Agent Wistrom." "I appreciate it." "Now, who are you?" "I can't tell you that." "Whoa!" "Whoa!" "Whoa." "Okay." "You brought a ghost buster to a DEA party?" "G-Girl, is this your new boyfriend?" "What the hell are you doing here?" "Listen." "G-Girl, I'm sorry I got DEA on you." "I must have mistranslated the agent." "So I can assure you, there is no bad guy behind this." "There's no bad guy?" "Well, then, who are you?" "I'm DEA." "DEA?" "You're the drug enforcement administration?" "That's right, sweetheart." "Please, call me Ozy." "May I see your badge?" "Sure." "All right, Ozy." "DEA agent." "DEA agent?" "Hands on your hips, please." "Oh, like so." "DEA." "Blown." "Yeah, like DEA." "And you're telling me this because...?" "Because I think you have a snitch in your midst and I think that snitch is a ghost." "I think she is a ghost, and I think maybe she's responsible for putting that ghost orb in G-Girl's bag." "I see." "Or perhaps it's the other way around." "I don't know." "But I'm thinking, if we test the girl..." "Don't test me." "Don't test me." "Sorry." "Look, I'm not testing you, I'm testing him, because I can see that you know more than you're saying and I can tell..." "Please, Ozy, don't trust them." "That's right, sweetheart, don't trust them." "Thank you, Ozy." "Don't call me Ozy." "G-Girl." "Okay." "We are gonna prove that this girl is not a ghost." "I'm gonna prove it." "G-Girl." "G-Girl." "Thank you, Snively." "You wanna test me too now?" "I knew you weren't a ghost." "I knew it." "Snively, send in J-Bone." "Let's get this thing going." "You might wanna change your outfit." "DEA isn't taking too well to guys in ski masks and swim fins." "Not to mention all these guns." "Guns?" "These guns?" "What, are you kidding me?" "What?" "I know what this is." "You guys aren't here to bust me, you're here to prove that I'm dating a DEA snitch!" "Geez, who are you calling a snitch?" "DEA stands for Drug Enforcement Administration." "Not "Drug Enforcemint Administration."" "It's not "Drug Enforcement Administration."" "Look, I am not a snitch." "I can prove it." "I can give you my badge." "G-Girl is who I'm here to see." "Agent Wistrom, you wanna come in here and talk about this?" "Hey, come on, Wistrom, don't be scared." "She is not a ghost." "She has a microchip implanted in her brain." "I don't have a microchip." "I wanna see that!" "Her badge." " But, sir..." " But, sir..." "You wanna talk, talk to me." "And you, you stay there." "See, Snively?" "He's totally convinced." "He's never gonna leave." "Stay here." "DEA is not convinced." "We're concerned that G-Girl may be a DEA agent because she went undercover at one time." "We all went undercover." "It's what we do to save America." "All right, let me bring you up to speed on my end." "One of the men I deal with in Bangkok, Ivan Lee, a.k.a. Ivan Whiskers is an international broker of sorts." "He was responsible for getting G-Girl into the country." "G-Girl thought she was here for a surfing lesson from one of his expat business friends." "Who's this guy she's supposed to meet?" "How are you?" "I'm good." "Thanks for asking." "Can you bring it up a little?" "Yeah." "This scrimshaw is one of a kind." "It was crafted by masters in the old country." "There's some pretty sick stuff in here." "A true fan of fine art would appreciate it." "You like art?" "Yeah." "I'm a fan of the Mona Lisa, of course, but I did get a questionable email about a certain Andy Warhol piece I just couldn't resist." "You got a good eye." "Right, boys?" "Here you go, Ivan." "Have a good time." "Thank you." "Bye-bye." "Nice lady." "Yeah." "She's got real class." "She's like a less trashy version of you." "You're trashy." "I'm eccentric." "Why did you talk me into this?" "G-Girl is supposed to be some kind of super secret agent." "G-Girl's a ruse." "If she was so great at what she does, she'd be on Uncle Sam's payroll with the other agents." "She's a false idol, G-Man, so we can put a stop to her." "G-Man?" "I picked it up from The Karate Kid." "Yeah, I know, but it's not a bad little nickname." "Thank you." "I'm sorry." "I gotta say, I think you're in love with her, Larry." "I don't have to put up with this." "It's not funny, Ivan." "This whole situation is completely screwed up." "You leave, you mess up my operation." "You know that." "Moneypenny would never put a dealer on her books." " You're getting DeJlo'd." "DEJLO:" "Don't touch my face." "Let's just do this and go back to the beach, okay?" "I'm sorry I made you come here." "He says, "Let's just do this and go back to the beach."" "That's what I'm gonna say to J-Bone." "I'm gonna just go back to the beach, and you guys can deal with your dealer situation." "Wait a minute, Mr. Lee." "You don't get it." "Excuse me, sir?" " Agent Ivan." " What?" "It's cool if you want to look around, but if you stay, you gotta buy something." "I don't understand." "Sir, what is this place?" "It's a market for people who don't trust each other." "You know what I mean?" "I'm really sorry, but we</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:34
