Gloria also paid tribute to her colleague, saying: “I have been blessed to work for NBC for 32 years. And not only has he allowed me to grow in my career, but he has been one of my dearest friends in the business. We had so much fun, I know he’s up there happy. I’m going to miss you so much. I love you.”

Eden expressed her gratitude to those who shared their love of the late star: “The outpouring of love and emotion from everyone is so special and will last for a long time.”

The Oscars are coming up on February 22! Let's see if a certain animated film or a director is going home with the gold or if that movie we were really excited about won't get any awards. After that Kimmel is interviewing the man we never really believed would be our next president, Donald Trump. After that let's take a look at some new series, some summer shows and some of our favorite films.

Reality TV Ratings Show Who's Hot Right Now

The new season has started and it's been interesting to see who had a good ratings weekend. I didn't think that the American Ninja Warrior would do well. Some of you said you didn't like that show. Some of you said that you did. American Ninja Warrior is doing okay. Dancing with the Stars is going up and down every week.

The Hollywood 411 Interview with Jimmy Kimmel and Donald Trump

Jimmy Kimmel is at it again. This time he was able to get an interview with Donald Trump, a man who is still trying to figure out what the hell he is doing. Trump is a billionaire, business man, reality TV star, New York City resident and it's a pretty interesting thing to see what he talks about.

The Hollywood 411 Interview with David Letterman

It's hard to believe that it's been 10 years since David Letterman retired as host of Late Night. You might not be watching his successor, Stephen Colbert, but you certainly know the work he's done as a comedian, actor, producer and director. You can visit him on the set of Netflix series he just produced called "Mystery Science Theater 3000" or you can see him performing on Broadway on a show called "Late Show".

What Will Jimmy Fallon and Donald Trump Talk About in Their First Ever Interview?

"It's interesting to me that all of the attention is on what the President does," said Donald Trump during a press conference back in October of 2015. "I don't want to hurt the President, I don't like getting beaten up by papers and the press."

Check out how that interview went down.
