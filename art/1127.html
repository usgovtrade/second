How to make a kitchen island fit into your space

It is the same principle, really. I think you are asking a very good question, and would benefit from looking at this book, A Man of God’s Own Name: A Spiritual Journey into Covenantal and Sacramental Theology by Bruce Chilton. At the end of Chilton’s book there is a very helpful guide to using the sacraments within congregations and how to keep the Eucharist and Lord’s Supper meaningful even in less active or smaller congregations.
I recommend that you read that chapter for some background as to why the word was used and what its meaning has been throughout church history.
I’ve always thought that the “Lord’s Supper” better described what goes on during Communion. And “Communion” is too close to “communion.”
I think the main point here is that we are to keep the eucharist, and communion (which is essentially another word for communion) an experience that is a bit sacred and special. A sacrament, no matter the name, should be.
If you follow Jesus, the Lord’s Supper, Communion, whatever you want to call it, is a weekly reminder of what Christ has done for you on the cross, and what you should be doing for Him in your life.
Thanks a lot for your comment! I totally agree with you that it should be a very special time, and I would always suggest to people to say a few prayers before or after they take part in it.
Is it a bit too much to say that this eucharistic meal is the actual spiritual nourishment for our souls?
I read many other books, but that was one of the most helpful.
I like your description of the Lord’s Supper and communion as ‘spiritual nourishment for our souls.’
In which book of scripture do we find this description of this sacrament?
When should the sacrament of Holy Communion be said on a Sunday?
Many people say the ‘Body and Blood of Jesus Christ’ is only available on the Lord’s day. Others say we can have it at any time, apart from the Lord’s day.
I would say the ‘Body and Blood of Jesus Christ’ is a metaphor for the Holy Spirit or divine presence which enables us to live a life pleasing to God, and which has been provided for us in Christ, by the work of His crucifixion.
In other words, the communion is a celebration of the fact that by the work of Christ we have been made right with God, and that we have a continual right to receive the Holy Spirit’s presence in our lives.
Thank you for your comment. I agree that Jesus is present every moment of every day, but we are still able to celebrate communion as a remembrance of what He did for us on the cross, as we are part of the Body of Christ.
What part of the Holy Communion and the Lord’s supper do people take issue with?
Thanks for the helpful comments and the answers to my questions. I will try to keep in mind the fact that communion is a reminder that the bread and wine are not really meant for us, but for Jesus. In other words, we are celebrating His sacrifice.
I agree that the Body and Blood of Christ are spiritual nourishment for our souls. Just like you say, we should not consume them, but should consider them to be like a ‘meal for the soul.’
I was taught that this physical meal is in fact God’s spiritual presence coming into our bodies, and nourishing our souls, as it is Jesus’ body and blood that was broken and spilled. Is this right?
Thanks again for your answer and for sharing what you have learned.
The bread and wine are symbols of Christ’s body and blood. I don’t know what you mean by ‘really meant’, but our bodies can indeed receive a blessing from spiritual communion with Christ.
Yes, you are correct that we do not consume the body and blood of Christ. That is, physically eat and drink Christ’s body. We receive His body spiritually through the anointing and sharing the bread.
I think my problem is with the word ‘really meant’.
Thanks for your comment. I wouldn’t say that people are taking issue with the bread and wine becoming ‘really Christ.’ That is a wonderful thing, and part of the mystery of faith.
My question is, what is it we are doing in communion when we break bread and drink wine?
I think you may have misunderstood me a bit. I meant that communion, or eating and drinking of the Body and Blood of Christ, in its most literal sense, is not really what happens during communion, but rather a metaphor for Christ’s presence.
This is something that the Church has struggled with, and it remains a difficult mystery.
I think you will find some really helpful talks in this chapter:
Thanks for your reply to my comments.
I want to make sure I am understanding your response to my question.
You said: “you break bread and drink wine, which represent His body and blood…”
I would not say that eating and drinking His body and blood takes place during communion. This does not seem to be what you are saying, but perhaps I am misunderstanding you.
I appreciate all your help and guidance.
As far as I’m concerned, there is no question. Jesus died and rose again. He gave us the body and blood of the Lord’s supper. He told us we are to eat and drink it. He does not eat and drink with us spiritually, but in real presence.
It is our duty as Christians to do what He says</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:29
