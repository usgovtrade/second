I told you not to do that.  That is going to complicate

that sucks.

I'm sure you did what you could do, but 
that is never going to be good enough for the cops. 
They are going to see him as nothing more than a "snitch".



CHAPTER 15

THE BANQUET AND THE FUNERAL

"It is not fair to compare your mother to 
the love of God, but if you do, your mother 
takes second place."

-Aline

IT was a long and tough night. I woke up
around 3 am to go and get a glass of water from
the bathroom at the bus. I heard a noise and 
turned around, to see my auntie, Cati, in tears
looking at me, looking sad. I said, "What's 
happening?" She hugged me, and said, "It is 
Mum. She is gone. She just slipped away." I 
thought, "We will make it though. You are my 
Auntie Cati, and no one will ever replace you. 
We will make it." It was just another thing. I 
got on the bus and went back to the hotel. The
first thing that I did when I walked in was 
have a long, hot bath, to try to get some of the
emotions out. I went to bed, knowing that I
had to attend the funeral in the morning, 
wondering how I was going to make it through 
that. I knew that with the police searching 
for me, they would assume that I was the one 
that was going to attend the funeral. I felt like
they would keep their eye on me. What made me
think that the police wouldn't be able to 
protect the funeral? 
I knew the police were not protecting 
everything around this place, so why was I 
expecting them to protect the funeral? It was
going to happen, and I had to face it.
I was lucky, to be able to attend the funeral
of my grandmother. It was a big feast and 
gathering. She was a wealthy woman. She owned 
a car, and a beautiful home in the middle of 
downtown Houston. It was not in our area. My 
grandfather was white, and owned a home, but 
his home was not in the middle of the city. It was 
in a separate, upper-class neighborhood. It was 
not in our "little town". But we lived in the 
"big" town. They would have a huge reception in 
their home, and they had enough friends to 
celebrate her life and what she had done to her
children and her friends. They had a lot of 
friends. Not to take anything from the black
community, but if they were to have the same 
celebration that she had in her neighborhood, 
where she grew up, they would have had 50 
friends. It would be a big celebration, a big 
party. My grandfather would invite all of the 
people that he used to work with. That was it.

She loved to spend time with 
friends and family. That was her.

She would have given them a reason to celebrate.
There was nothing left, 
she had everything. She had a
home, a car, and
security. Her own. She had 
nothing left to keep up. No job, no reason 
to get up in the morning, just to take care of 
herself. She was a rich woman, and had enough.
Money is freedom. It can buy you 
everything that you want. You don't need 
anything more. The people in my community
did not think that she had done anything 
extraordinary, but she did. She did what
she was supposed to do. There was
nothing more she could do. This is what 
she did. This is what God gave her. She was 
loved. She was loved beyond measure. This is 
what she was doing. She was having a big 
celebration. She had planned a big party for 
people. A lot of friends were invited. She loved
having big parties. I think it was because of the
songs and her love for soul and funk music. 
She loved to party and have fun. I guess she 
was the kind of person that would love you 
for the time that she was with you, not the 
person you were when she left you. I don't 
know. She was very, very kind. She would be 
on the phone for hours and hours and hours, 
talking to everyone that she knew. You'd hear 
her laughing. She would have phone calls and 
she would laugh. She would laugh because 
you'd be talking. You had to speak clearly, and 
you had to speak loud because she was deaf in 
one ear.
She had a lot of friends that she would 
be on the phone with. She loved to 
speak with my cousins and my aunties. I 
don't think she did it as much anymore. She
was tired and going deaf. It was hard on her.
Maybe it was just easier to talk to some 
people by email or Facebook. When I was 
sitting with her for a couple of hours, she 
might put the phone down for a while. You 
had to be able to talk a lot, and be loud, to 
get her attention. She was a lover, and had a 
lot of fun. She was my friend, and we had a 
lot of fun.

She was a caring, loving mother and a
very loyal, kind friend. She didn't have time
for people who were not close to her. She had
fun. She had a lot of laughs with people she 
loved, not just her family. She loved to have 
a good time. I had no idea about that. She was 
a good person. She gave people a lot of 
support and love, and laughter, and 
affection. She gave the people she loved 
that. She had friends that she did not like. 
Sometimes you just have to let a person go, 
because she is not your friend. And a 
lot of people did not like her. Maybe because 
she was loud, or because they could not 
speak with her in their native language, or 
maybe she was not their type.
She did not think she was better than any one 
of us, but she was good. She was a good person.

They did a big burial. When the man 
started calling people to come and honor her, 
I felt like they should have had some kind of 
protection, at least for the time that we were 
there. They should have had some kind of 
protection. I was wondering how they were 
going to keep us safe. But it was not until 
after the funeral that I was told, "We are 
talking about protection for her." I asked, "We
are talking about protection from the police?" 
I wanted to know, "Why? Why is protection 
needed?" One of the cops told me, "I can't 
say anything more, but when we are doing the 
testimony and everybody is looking at us, 
they are going to try to get close to you, and 
you need to watch for them." I said, "Okay. I 
know how I am going to feel like if I am 
approached by the police, because I am not 
going to like it. I won't like it one bit. But 
I'll say I did not do anything, because I have 
been doing nothing all night." I did not want 
to hear that one more time. I knew what was 
going to happen. I knew what was going to 
happen. I did not know how I was going to
defend myself. They would
make sure to find out who they were looking 
for, and they would start looking for me, I 
knew that. I was going to have to leave soon.
I was going to make sure that when the
police came, they found me. I was
going to try to have
them leave me alone.

It was a funeral, and people
were going to have to look at the 
police. They were going to have to look at the
police, and look at me, and the police were 
going to leave. The police were going to go 
away. I would not have to do anything. I had 
the police leaving me. I knew that the police 
were just looking for the people they were 
looking for, and that was it. They would not
be looking at me. I was glad that I was 
trying to have the police leave, and that they 
had not found me.

I was going</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:47
