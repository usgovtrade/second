A motor vehicle door latch is known from DE 20 2012 100 672 U1 which discloses a motor vehicle door latch with an unlocking and closing operation and/or an opening operation and with a locking mechanism. The locking mechanism of the motor vehicle door latch comprises a drive shaft which is mounted rotatably, preferably, the rotatable shaft of the drive shaft can be coupled in a detachable manner with a coupling shaft, such that the motor vehicle door latch may be moved from the closed position into the open position or vice versa. The coupling shaft of the motor vehicle door latch is mounted rotatably in such a way that the unlocking and closing operation and/or the opening operation of the motor vehicle door can be carried out either manually by means of a rotary movement or automatically by means of a motor.
A locking system, a motor vehicle door lock or locking device is known from DE 202 19 033 U1 which comprises a locking device with a coupling mechanism, wherein the locking device is mounted on a latch rod or a striker as a first lock component and is rotatably mounted on the door as a second lock component. The locking device is mounted rotatably via a pin on a lock housing, and the locking device is fixed with respect to the lock housing, in particular, with respect to the rotary axis of the lock housing. It is provided that a coupling mechanism which is connected to the coupling element of the locking device can be displaced by means of an opening and closing aid. A locking mechanism is known from DE 203 18 781 U1 which is constructed in such a way that a motor vehicle door latch can be opened and closed in two stages, wherein the first stage of opening the motor vehicle door latch is effected by means of a motor, and the second stage of opening is effected manually.
EP 1 602 944 A1 shows a locking mechanism in a motor vehicle door latch with a door lock which comprises two coupling points for coupling the motor vehicle door latch. The locking mechanism is mounted rotatably by means of a pin on a lock housing and is fixedly mounted with respect to the lock housing, in particular, with respect to the rotary axis of the lock housing.
The object of the invention is to reduce the installation space requirement for a motor vehicle door latch.
This object is achieved by a motor vehicle door latch with a locking mechanism by which the motor vehicle door may be locked in a closed position, wherein the locking mechanism is constructed in such a way that an unlocking and closing operation and/or an opening operation of the motor vehicle door may be carried out via a motor or manually. The locking mechanism may be, for example, the locking mechanism of the motor vehicle door latch according to the invention. In this case, the motor vehicle door latch is mounted, for example, in a motor vehicle door lock or locking device which is known from EP 1 602 944 A1. The locking mechanism is then mounted rotatably with respect to the lock housing of the motor vehicle door lock or locking device, wherein the locking mechanism is mounted with respect to the lock housing in such a way that a rotary movement, in particular, an unlocking and closing movement of the motor vehicle door latch can be carried out via a motor or manually. In this case, the motor vehicle door latch according to the invention is mounted rotatably on the lock housing of the motor vehicle door lock or locking device. The locking mechanism is mounted with respect to the lock housing, in particular, rotatably with respect to the rotary axis of the lock housing.
The object of the invention is also achieved by a motor vehicle door latch with a motor vehicle door and a door frame, and with a locking mechanism by which the motor vehicle door may be locked in a closed position. The locking mechanism is constructed in such a way that an unlocking and closing operation and/or an opening operation of the motor vehicle door may be carried out via a motor or manually. The locking mechanism is mounted rotatably with respect to the door frame of the motor vehicle door and is mounted in such a way that a rotary movement, in particular, an unlocking and closing movement of the motor vehicle door may be carried out via a motor or manually. In this case, the motor vehicle door latch according to the invention is mounted rotatably on the door frame of the motor vehicle door. The locking mechanism is mounted with respect to the door frame, in particular, rotatably with respect to the rotary axis of the door frame.
It is also an object to provide a motor vehicle door latch with a motor vehicle door, with a door frame, and with a locking mechanism, by which the motor vehicle door may be locked in a closed position. The locking mechanism may be constructed in such a way that an unlocking and closing operation and/or an opening operation of the motor vehicle door may be carried out via a motor or manually. The locking mechanism is mounted in such a way that a rotary movement, in particular, an unlocking and closing movement of the motor vehicle door may be carried out via a motor or manually. The locking mechanism is mounted with respect to the door frame of the motor vehicle door in such a way that a rotary movement, in particular, an unlocking and closing movement of the motor vehicle door may be carried out via a motor or manually.
According to the invention, it is provided that the locking mechanism is constructed in such a way that an unlocking and closing operation and/or an opening operation of the motor vehicle door may be carried out either manually or automatically by means of a motor.
It is advantageous, according to the invention, if the locking mechanism is constructed in such a way that a rotary movement of the locking mechanism is carried out manually, in particular, by means of a mechanical component which is connected to the locking mechanism or a rotational movement of the locking mechanism, in particular, of the locking mechanism with respect to the rotary axis of the locking mechanism may be carried out manually. According to the invention, it is provided that a rotary movement of the locking mechanism may be carried out mechanically by means of an operating element which is connected to the locking mechanism.
The invention is based on the principle that the locking mechanism can be mounted rotatably with respect to the lock housing, wherein the locking mechanism is mounted in such a way that a rotary movement of the locking mechanism is carried out mechanically. According to the invention, it is provided that the locking mechanism is mounted rotatably with respect to the door frame, in particular, the locking mechanism can be mounted in such a way that a rotary movement of the locking mechanism is carried out mechanically. It is particularly advantageous if the locking mechanism is mounted in such a way that a rotary movement of the locking mechanism is carried out mechanically. The locking mechanism may be mounted rotatably with respect to the door frame in such a way that a rotary movement of the locking mechanism is carried out manually.
