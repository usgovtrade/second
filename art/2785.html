New York City quartet Invisible Fences play an eclectic mix of psychedelic, grunge, shoegaze and noise rock for audiences around the world, but the band has been going strong locally for more than 20 years. The band has been playing their own brand of guitar-driven rock at downtown area venues since they moved to NYC.

The band’s current set up consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Chris “Cruiser” Osgood, guitarists Andrew “Hooty” Hooten and Kevin McGraw, bassist and backing vocalist Todd Morris, and drummer Matt “Mr. Sock” Pfeiffer. The band’s first single, the aptly named “Ones and Zeroes”, came out in 1995 and was followed by the EP “A Diversion From the Path”. Cruiser has released four studio albums since – two under the name “Invisible Fences” and two under the name “Blackbird”. As of December 2016, the band has released its fifth full length album, “Thousand Faces”.

In 2011, the band’s album “Blackbird” was released on the prestigious Kscope label, whose catalog includes recordings by acts like Nick Cave, My Bloody Valentine, Boris, and more. Check out the new video from the band for “Million Eyes” (embedded below).

According to the video description, the song is about “rejection of the religious system – people being thrown into the furnace.”

It’s a really interesting track, and one that I’m totally digging! The last several weeks has seen a huge influx of really cool grunge/punk-ish groups from the 80’s and 90’s.

The video for “Million Eyes” is a great combination of the old and new. I can easily see Cruiser being a part of the Kscope roster in a few years, as they just recently just released their fourth album, Thousand Faces. The album is available for streaming via Spotify below.

The Kessler Theater, a midtown Manhattan concert venue located at 151 East 64th Street, is now charging an electronic processing fee on all tickets sold on their site. According to a Facebook post by The Kessler, the fee is a “necessary, minimal fee” to “cover the costs associated with accepting credit cards.” The Kessler cites their large ticketing and credit card processing fees as a major reason for the fee.

“To process credit card transactions, ticket sales require a 3.2% fee plus another fee that varies depending on the credit card that was used for payment (more details below),” the Facebook post explains. “The net effect: If you buy a ticket on The Kessler’s website using a credit card, your ticket price will change by 3.2% + an additional 5.3% + any service fees incurred by the credit card company</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-15 19:04:39
