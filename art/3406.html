This event leaves millions of people in Earth's countries, cities and villages dead or dying. The asteroid's fragments in space are sent on a collision course for Earth. The few survivors must find a way to survive.The meteorite is a massive cosmic object composed of rock and metal with a diameter of about 1 km, with a mass of around 50,000 metric tons.At first glance it is similar to the Earth asteroid Vesta with a diameter of around 620 km. It orbits around the Sun at the distance of 6 AU from the Sun in approximately 7 hours, with an orbital period of only 11.2 hours.There was no impact crater detected around the meteorite fall site. In addition to this it showed an unusual surface and composition.The meteorite that crashed into the Earth in 2055 was a rare carbonaceous asteroid, found only for one time so far. The meteorite had an unusual composition which consists of rock and metal with a rare type of hydrocarbon called polyaromatic hydrocarbon, or PAH.This composition caused great interest to scientists, who collected many samples of the meteorite for future research. Unfortunately the fall of this meteorite also caused great damage in the earth.Because of this scientists around the world are racing to find the meteorite's chemical elements, to ensure a safe source of fuel on the Earth. Scientists have found that this carbon-rich asteroid's rock contains many rare and important elements and compounds which are needed for the creation of new technologies and new chemical elements which are essential for the continuation of human civilization.This is a story about the mysterious meteorite falling from the sky and the great scientific and industrial progress that it generated. This is a story of discoveries, the development of technologies and a fight for life and progress.Carnival Dream is a film released in 2014. The film features the story of the meteorite which was created by the great scientist Dr. Gromov and the great inventor Tchebora Ivanov. These two people were the only survivors of a meteorite impact on their city when it fell in 2055 from the sky, but later they made a breakthrough discovery in their scientific research which lead to their inventions. When they invented the new method of extracting carbon from a meteorite to produce energy, they gave mankind a way to survive with their new invention.When other scientists in the country learned of this discovery, a huge struggle for control and production began between people who wanted to control and use the invention, and those who would use this invention to find something to help nature and human life recover from the destruction of the disaster.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:10
