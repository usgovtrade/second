Another one of the most recognizable parts of the song is the line "I met a guru in the hallway, he said something cruel is about to happen..."

One of the versions of this song, released in 1988, has two versions of the chorus. One line of the chorus is "I met a guru in the hallway, he said something cruel is about to happen..."

The song was covered by Scottish punk/indie rock band The Vaselines on their album Dum Dum.

In an appearance on RedLetterMedia's review show "Best of Both Worlds", host Dan Trachtenberg and writer Simon Riggs argued that the refrain "he said something cruel is about to happen" is an example of what they consider to be clich√© lyrics.

In 2019, the song was covered by a Japanese idol group called Especia on the album "Pirits".
