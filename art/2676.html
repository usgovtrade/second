**Open** Breakfast, lunch & dinner daily

**Credit cards** AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V

If any other joint claimed it was the best breakfast place in town, we'd dismiss it, but not when it's owned by a Texan and this claim is backed up by several James Beard nominations. And we can vouch for the fact that a biscuit here is well worth the hefty price tag. Eggs come from nearby Stoddard's own chicken farm, the omelettes are cooked to order and the fresh fruit and berries arrive daily from the owners' own orchards. Add homemade jams, fresh sourdough bread and organic coffee and it's an all-American breakfast to die for.

###  SOUTHERN BELLE MRS B'S BARBECUE  Barbecue $

Offline map Google map

(www.mrsbsbarbecue.com; 4300 E Hampden Ave; half rack $13;  5pm-8pm Thu-Mon;  ) A huge and convivial place just a few blocks from the main tourist drag. Mrs B's specialises in dry-rubbed pork but it's no slouch with the chicken, either. It's especially popular on Sundays when a whole hog is cooked and barbecued until the meat falls off the bone. There's music on the weekends from 8pm to 11pm.

### TAPSHACK & FIRE IN THE PIT  Barbecue $

Offline map Google map

(6223 Marengo Ave; half rack $12;  11am-10pm Mon-Sat, to 3pm Sun) A classic in these parts. This is a friendly joint where everybody's welcome. It's owned by an elderly couple who cook and slice meats in-house (and don't skimp on fat), which gives the ribs, brisket and pulled pork that added smoke flavor. We love the homemade sauce and, of course, the beer.

### STONE'S SOUTH STREET BBQ  Barbecue $

Offline map Google map

(   410-244-4605; 3610 Chester St; half rack $12;   4pm-7pm Sun & Mon) Located in the Mt Vernon neighborhood near Patterson Park and a good place to go if you don't want to trek to U Street for your ribs and brisket. Owner-chef Stone (a _Top Chef_ reject) does things the old-school way: wood smoking and all.

### BIG TREE

Folks in Maryland refer to Washingtonians as 'Washingtons', but they're most definitely locals to DC's other big draw: The National Zoo. At the zoo you'll find a large number of locals in the parking lots, at the snack bars or in front of the zoo entrance – taking in the scene with a hot cup of java in hand. That's because the big attraction here is the National Zoo, which is an awesome experience and the best place to bring kids. There are lots of other places to take in the sights as well, but nothing tops the zoo. Make sure you visit all of the sections of the zoo, though, as some of the animals will only be located at certain sections.

For kids there's a petting zoo, a carousel and a miniature train, while older kids may want to play some sports at the sports park, which includes soccer, basketball and tennis courts.

For information about the zoo, call   202-654-6098 or visit www.nationalzoo.si.edu.

### JUANITA'S SOUTHERN KITCHEN, COTTAGE HILL  Barbecue $

(2901 Alabama Ave SE; platters $7-10;   11am-8:30pm Mon-Thu, 11am-9pm Fri, 10am-8:30pm Sat, 10am-8pm Sun) A great place to grab take-out. The barbecue platters are cooked on a smoking hog head. A spicy and sweet sauce flavors the pieces of meat.

### EL PIRAMIDE TAQUERIA, GALERIA LUCERO ROSTRO, U ST & 12TH STREET NEAR MCTOP

Offline map Google map

(1208 U St NW; mains $4-6;   11am-9:30pm) With so many taquerias lining the U St corridor of 'Little Colombia' (the small neighborhood of Colombian restaurants and other Latino businesses), it's hard to know what exactly this place does that's different from the rest. It's been around for a long time and everyone calls it a mom-and-pop joint, which means the quality should be good. They've added some new flavors to the menu (soups, tacos and tortas), but the food is still basic. So if you're a fan of basic or just want some good grub, the _arepas_ (corn flatbread) and _tostadas_ (tortillas with different fillings) are always worth a try. Don't forget to save room for dessert, either. If they make a good chocolate truffle, you'll be eating them before you know it.

### WASHINGTON, DC LAMB SANDWICHES

You've probably seen them in Union Station and the food court in Gallery Place. They're little, open-faced submarine sandwiches of grilled lamb, melted cheese, house pickles and onion. There are two local sandwich makers who claim to be the ones who invented them (we can't verify that), but the sandwiches originated in New York City in the late 19th century. Washingtonians eat the sandwiches so much that they became associated with DC's government. It's no wonder that many Washingtonians consider them the ultimate DC sandwich. But beware – that's a lot of calories and fat for one guy.

### CHURROS MANIA 

Offline map Google map

(www.churrosmania.com; 5018 Connecticut Ave NW;   7am-11pm Mon-Thu, 7am-11:30pm Fri, 8am-11:30pm Sat, 8am-11pm Sun) It's a bit confusing when you walk into this tiny shop at Connecticut and Florida. The wall with a big round mirror with a menu of churros? That's where you order the frozen hot-chocolate drinks that they serve in the basement below. The place to go for savory Venezuelan empanadas, _arepas_ (a baked or boiled cornmeal cake) and, most importantly, churros.

### ALEXANDER'S TAVERN MEXICAN $$

Offline map Google map

(www.alexanders.com; 3275 Connecticut Ave NW; dinner mains $10-24;   6am-midnight Mon-Fri, 7am-1am Sat & Sun;   ) The menu at this upscale eatery inside the Embassy Row Hotel is mostly seafood with Tex-Mex dishes and vegetarian options. It's a fun place for brunch.

### EL RINOCERO DULCE MEXICAN $$

Offline map Google map

(www.elrinocerorestaurant.com; 4200 Wisconsin Ave NW;   11am-1am Mon-Fri, 7am-1am Sat & Sun) The best reason to stop at this Mexican restaurant is to hang out on the outdoor patio on the 3rd St end of the building. And there's also a large shaded patio in the middle of the building that's also a perfect place to relax.

### FANTASIA & TASTEOF CHINA  Chinese $

Offline map Google map

(www.fannastasia.com; 2118 11th St NW; mains $4-8;   10am-10pm) This place is _the_ spot for dim sum (or 'little eats') on a Sunday when the area turns into a market for locals to come and catch up over a few rounds of dumplings and noodles.

### UPPER LINE LOUNGE  American $$$

Offline map Google map

(www.upperline.com; 3015 P St NW; brunch $9-17, dinner mains $27-38;   5:30-10pm Sun-Thu, 5:30-11pm Fri & Sat) From the outside, this place is a bit of an eyesore. The food inside, however, is anything but. The chef likes to blend high- and lowbrow cuisine – lobster pot pie served with chicken livers, foie gras ravioli and steak tartare all roll out of the same kitchen. There's also a three-course dinner (Monday to Friday) that starts with a crab bisque and tuna sashimi salad, followed by steamed grouper. And be sure to leave room for dessert.

### LA GRANITA TRATTORIA ITALIAN $$

(www.lagraniatrattoria.com; 2818 Connecticut Ave NW; mains $14-20;   5:30-10:30pm Mon-Thu, 5:30-11pm Fri & Sat, 5:30-10pm Sun;   ) An interesting restaurant where wait</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:53
