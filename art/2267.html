However, in general I think that the most important issue is that the new process is far more explicit, and does not require additional knowledge to understand the situation.

I believe it would be great to have an option to create a new account and migrate the old posts to the new one, but this can not be done unless you are logged into your Wordpress website (you must enter your password to be able to do it). So if I did not have access to the old admin login of my blog, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to login to Wordpress, then move the data over to the new site. In order to be able to do so, I would have to set up another Wordpress account.

It is actually possible to migrate posts from one account to another, but we would need to change the WordPress login procedure to support this, so it will require some significant programming. This is not being worked on at the moment. It is not a trivial thing to implement. I suppose one could hack the code a bit, but we are not interested in pursuing that route for this.

Thanks for this really interesting post ‚Äì it is really good to be able to read an explanation like that! But i am sorry to say that I have to say you were just wrong‚Ä¶

I found that some times back, it was really annoying to be signed in as 2 accounts on a site, because for example i logged in and set up a calendar. And later when i wanted to switch from my normal account to another one (as you said because of a comment i just wanted to see with that one), everything went to hell on this site.

So if i will never will leave my blog ‚Äì this is the only thing I can think about when it comes to the new sign up ‚Äì the only thing I can see:

1. It should not be possible to login to WordPress as an admin user ‚Äì since there is the possibility that the user might forget about the other account (if I won‚Äôt use the other one) and then if he will be logged in as an admin account and a normal user, he might see something he doesn‚Äôt want to (in my case the calendar).

2. When a user registers for the first time (with the new process) ‚Äì then should he not be able to create a post in his blog ‚Äì he should only be able to edit his profile and read news and subscribe and login.

Otherwise I can just see it to get really annoying when you have to switch user accounts and this always happens at the same place: on the blog itself.

(oh ‚Äì the only thing I can imagine is to keep the link to the blog homepage so that this is displayed for a normal user and the user has to click the button to go to the blog itself ‚Äì of course you have to think of a better way than this)

Thanks for the explanation, it was really interesting to read it. I also find the fact you wrote this article helpful, because it is very useful.

I‚Äôve written a lot about it and also published a post in which I explain what I think should happen: http://wpmentality.com/wordpress-sign-up/

You should also have a look at the original post in the comments, for example. To be honest I think we need to figure out a way to prevent people having two accounts on the same site if they don‚Äôt want them to.

I tried to create a test account, but couldn‚Äôt. What do you mean by that? There‚Äôs no ‚Äúcreate an account‚Äù link in the bottom right corner, where you would enter your information and then have the new account created automatically. Or am I missing something?

Anyway, thanks again for the helpful post! And if you have time and have a couple of minutes to spend, feel free to have a look at my blog to see what I‚Äôm talking about üôÇ

Ok, I found it now ‚Äì it was really stupid because there was a button which was so obvious to find (in the bottom right corner) that I completely missed it. Anyway thanks for the comments!

So since I did not have access to the blog because of the second login problem ‚Äì i was not able to enter the code and look in what you have changed.

I guess I have some more comments:

1. When you are setting up a new account (using the email-adress and then a username that you know ‚Äì instead of the wp-admin-login (or whatever it is called) where you can see the email-address and username and set up the password ‚Äì would it be possible to have a link in the wp-admin that says ‚Äúcreate new account‚Äù?

I know the question about the password is quite easy (if a users password is not set, you can just enter your email-adress and he will then get a message about the password being needed), but the other question is quite difficult and I want to prevent the users to login to WordPress with their email.

1) You have the option of not using a password at all, since this allows for auto-login and uses encrypted cookies. Users that don‚Äôt want to use a password should still be able to log in by just entering an email address and username.

3) You can‚Äôt have the same email as another WordPress user, since that‚Äôs where the password is stored. It‚Äôs possible, however, that someone could steal your password and reset their password by logging into your account. In fact, I know there is a vulnerability that allows this to happen if you‚Äôve changed your password.

@Oscar, I have posted some more information in the comments and have also added a detailed explanation in the article itself. I tried to add it to the comments, but the comment didn‚Äôt seem to show. If you‚Äôve not yet read the comments, you may find them useful.

The only thing I can think of is if I would delete the blog in which I do not want to get access to ‚Äì but that is kind of cheating and I would also loose everything that was posted in it (photos, comments, posts, friends, tags etc.)

There are other possible solutions and I think it‚Äôs great that you write about them. I think you‚Äôre looking at them from a different perspective. I‚Äôve only been involved in website development for about 3 months, but I want to be involved in it for a much longer time.

I just checked again ‚Äì I still can not access my old account! When I try to enter my email address, it tells me that I have already created an account. But in reality, I have not logged in. I can see the new account by going into the dashboard.

I now tried to log in ‚Äì but the same thing ‚Äì it says that I have already created an account. The thing is ‚Äì it does not even show me where to enter my password and email-adress ‚Äì I only have the opportunity to change my password which is set to ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that it did automatically.

And now I still can not get in with my old username and password (I know, it‚Äôs kind of stupid of me to be able to login, but this is because I want to access the information stored).

Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts on this process, it‚Äôs very important to get constructive feedback. In fact, I think this is what we should be doing more of ‚Äì rather than just posting code on GitHub!

@Jerry, it‚Äôs possible to view all the posts from that blog, but not the comments since it would involve retrieving your information from Facebook.

As you can see from the comments above, a number of us disagree with the new design of creating a WordPress account, because of the fact that it can happen in an existing account if you access the blog by entering the username and password of the old account. The original plan was to make a new account with a new name, but this was deemed confusing and too complicated.

Aside from this, I also found a way to access my WordPress blog from a completely different account with no need for cookies and a password.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:13
