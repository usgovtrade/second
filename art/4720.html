The NWS Houston/Galveston Tropical Meteorological Center said that a “potential flood situation” may develop, with some areas of Houston at risk for flooding.

According to the National Weather Service, areas north of I-10 between I-45 and Galveston Bay may be affected by “flash flooding,” as well as the Woodlands areas. IAH, north of I-610 and west of I-10, may be at risk of seeing significant rain amounts and flash flooding.

The Weather Service said if you see any areas of flooding, please report it to NWS Houston at 866-BEMAIN.

Flood Advisory for Harris County issued: 12:42 a.m. | 5:42 p.m.https://t.co/1N1ZU8K7d9 #txwx pic.twitter.com/pL9y5W4ZYT — NWS Houston (@NWSHouston) January 26, 2020

According to the National Weather Service, rainfall amounts in Houston could reach 4 to 8 inches.

The NWS Houston/Galveston Tropical Meteorological Center said in its forecast:

“Today and tonight will be slow to moderate rain that may lead to some street flooding in locations. The main threat will be between midday and 10 p.m. Sunday, when a cold front will move through. The front will quickly go through after 10 p.m. with much colder air along with gusty west winds that will cause the low-level convergence zone to become much weaker. Rainfall amounts will reach from around 0.5 inches south of Interstate 10 westward to around 4 inches near the coast.”
