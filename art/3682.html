The song was re-used for a series of TV commercials for the Australian ice cream chain Scream 'n' Sour by Sydney-based record company, RooArt Music. The commercial version features Australian rap artist, Briggs, and contains an additional verse not in the original version.

The song was also used as the theme song for the 1985 film The Karate Kid, although that was written by composer Harold Faltermeyer.

The dance routine was later included in the 1988 motion picture 'Kickboxer'.

Notable covers
The song was covered by The Strikers in 1983 with vocals by Robyne Robinson and Reggie Houston on their album Robyne & Reggie in Full Effect.

British pop group Shakespears Sister did a cover of the song on their 2000 covers album Broken Angels.

The song is the theme song to the short-lived sitcom Riptide and is included on the album Riptide: The Music of Paul Jabara.
