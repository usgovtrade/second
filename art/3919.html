The two played very well together, until the last week when the team lost its first game of the season. But it had a great start, it just didn't last.



So now, the two will go their separate ways. One will be traded away, while the other will get a fresh start in a new team. It was a great partnership, and I feel bad for them.

Thank you for supporting Alone and the best two players this season: @AloneRL and @GrualDubois

The final deadline for all roster changes has come and gone, meaning that every player in the Season 4 Rocket League Championship Series will be locked in for the duration of the season.



However, we‚Äôve already moved up one player from our official roster: After an incredible run in Season 3, we brought Jirair back to Europe‚Äôs roster for Season 4. We‚Äôre happy to welcome him back to our line up, and we hope that you are too.
