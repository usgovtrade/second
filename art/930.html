Instead 
of the 
normal 
two-day 
period, 
we 
experienced 
a 
rapid 
deterioration. 
When it 
was most 
dangerous 
to leave 
the hospital, 
we could not 
leave the 
room. We 
spent two 
months in the 
hospital. The 
children 
slept in the 
same room. 
Eventually 
we went to a 
new hospital 
for 
treatment. 
Later we 
went to a 
special 
center in 
Mexico City. 
The same 
house in 
Cuernavaca 
is still being 
used by many 
people. They 
are 
homeless, but 
the place is 
still sacred 
for them. They 
go there for 
healing and 
guidance. 
It also helps 
them to stay 
connected to 
where they came 
from. It is a 
very sad 
conclusion of 
our family. 
They could not 
see me even 
once during my 
treatment. The 
doctor and my 
husband, Rafael, 
told me I would 
see them 
again. I did. 
I saw my 
children every 
day, but when 
my husband got 
in touch with me, 
he told me to 
move on. He 
wanted to meet 
them in 
another place.
I was devastated. 
I was told by 
other people, 
that his father 
(my late 
husband) was a 
great man who 
sacrificed all he 
had to look for a 
better life for 
his family. I 
came here with 
nothing. My 
husband sent me 
away from my 
country with 
only two 
tattered 
suitcases. I 
worked for many 
years 
before he was 
able to join me. 
I had worked as a 
school teacher in 
the streets of 
our 
neighborhood. 
I never dreamed 
that one day I 
would be 
separated from 
my family, 
especially in the 
way that I lost 
contact with 
them. There was 
no hope that I 
would see them 
again. It is a 
terrible 
tragedy for our 
family. 
I always trusted 
God and the 
strength I 
learned from my 
faith. 
I could not 
sleep at night 
during my 
treatment. I 
tried to sleep 
but couldn't. 
Every night I 
dreamt about my 
family. 
I would wake up 
late at night, 
crying. I would 
say my prayers 
and pray for 
them. 
God heard me. He 
healed my wounds.
He sent me this 
message: My son 
is no longer a 
homeless man. He 
will not beg for 
food anymore. 
He can live in 
a home with 
electricity 
instead of using 
charcoal to cook. 
He can take a 
warm bath once a 
day, because 
there is a bath 
at my home. 
He will not 
lose his clothes 
and beg for 
money. There is 
no need to beg for 
money. He can use 
a towel for 
clothes. 
God told me that 
my other son 
Miguel, who died 
at the age of 13, 
will also be in 
that home. He will 
become a good man 
and will no longer 
use drugs. He will 
learn to study 
more. He will help 
with the 
housework, and 
he will love us 
again. We will 
see him every day. 
Miguel always 
loved flowers, so 
we will have a lot 
of flowers in our 
home. He will 
receive his 
blessings. I 
thank God for 
that. The house 
will be very big. 
I also saw in my 
dreams that I 
will be healed of 
my cancer. The 
doctors said I 
would not survive. 
I am feeling very 
good and healthy. 
God is hearing my 
prayers. He is 
with me. He will 
heal me with the 
grace of God. 
My whole family 
came to visit me 
at the 
hospital. I 
welcomed them with 
flowers, a bowl of 
water and two 
tattered 
candles. They 
told me not to 
give up, because 
the last few 
months were the 
worst 
stretches for our 
whole family. 
My eldest son is 
almost 17 years 
old, but he needs 
constant 
guidance and 
support. 
I have been 
helping him the 
best I can, with 
medication, but he 
has a lot to learn. 
He is my little 
man. 
I think he might 
be working and 
looking for a job. 
He is already 
saving for the 
bus to go home. 
I have told him 
that I forgive him 
for what he did. 
He doesn't need to 
be angry with me. 
I want him to come 
home. He can live 
at my house with 
us. We will find a 
way to help him, 
and to forgive him 
and 
continue our 
relationship. I 
had to tell him 
that. We are going 
to help him. I will 
stay close to him.
God told me I was 
blessed with many 
children and they 
are good children. 
They love their 
father. I know my 
children. I know 
my children 
better than anyone 
else. 
Miguel, my son, 
died two months 
before his 
birthday. 
Rafael is 
responsible for 
this. His father 
worked as a driver 
and they were 
moving houses and 
that was his job. 
He brought the 
family to the 
United 
States.  I had 
to earn money to 
help my mother and 
all the boys. The 
last house was on 
the way to a place 
where there was a 
lot of drugs. 
Miguel was 13 
years old, a good 
boy. He did not 
participate in 
that. I do not 
know the rest of 
the family. 
I lost contact with 
them in 2010, when 
I was taken into 
the hospital. I 
was in a hospital 
for about two 
years. I 
discovered that 
the hospital is not 
healthy for the 
human body. It 
does not always 
improve the 
condition. After 
two years, my 
physicians 
informed me that I 
could go home. 
I was very 
grateful to them. 
Rafael and I were 
so happy to be 
together again. 
We 
looked for a 
house, and were 
looking for an 
apartment for 
ourselves and our 
son. I also had to 
start my work 
again. 
I wanted to live 
near the 
hospital. We had 
our own medical 
records, so I knew 
that I could work. 
I wanted to 
improve my life. 
It did not work out. 
I found a new 
apartment. 
I had to pay rent. 
Rafael worked all 
day and bought our 
food. Then at 
night he would 
work with the 
homeless people. 
That was his work. 
He did not want to 
stay home and do 
nothing. 
He was not happy 
with that. I am 
grateful for 
him. 
He is the only one 
who helped me, and 
he did not want me 
to have anything. 
He spent his time 
outside 
begging for 
money. He only had 
a few cents. </div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:13
