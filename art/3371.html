(Italics ours.)
[7]  In order to create an irrevocable donative trust, the settlor must designate a beneficiary. In this regard, RCW 11.100.010 provides:

The terms "trust" and "trustee" as used in this chapter shall be construed to include any or all trusts created by declaration, agreement, deed, transfer, will, or other instrument in writing, for the purpose of conveying, directly or indirectly, any property or interest therein, and every trust heretofore created by will shall be construed to be declared in writing within the meaning of this chapter.

[8]  In addition, an "instrument in writing" includes a declaration of trust. RCW 11.02.010(13) provides: "Declaration of trust" means an instrument containing an expression of intention to create a trust; provided, that, for purposes of RCW 11.94A RCW only, an agreement between persons that it shall become effective only upon performance of future acts by one or more of the parties, shall be deemed to be a "declaration of trust".
[9]  In addition, the terms "trust" and "trustee" as used in the statute means any fiduciary relationship through which one person holds property or exercises control over property for the benefit of another. RCW 11.02.010(10) provides:

Trust includes an estate in property, an interest in property, a trust, an executory contract to transfer an interest in property, and a beneficial interest in a trust or property, whether legal or equitable.

[10]  The trust estate should be described in an instrument containing an expression of intention to create a trust or by reference to a definite document which contains such description.

In addition, RCW 11.94A.060 provides:

(1) The court shall find the facts specially upon each issue of fact material to the proceeding and state its conclusions of law thereon.
(2) The court shall enter such orders as it finds are required to carry out the terms of this chapter.
(3) If a person dies before the appointment of a guardian, the court shall enter orders as it finds necessary to appoint a guardian and establish an appropriate guardianship estate for the protection and benefit of the proposed ward.
(4) A complete statement of the facts found and the conclusions of law shall be entered in the journal or recorded in a separate document included in the clerk's file.

[11]  A "trust agreement" is an instrument in writing, signed by the settlor, or by another party in his or her fiduciary capacity, creating a trust. A "declaration of trust" is an instrument in writing stating the trustor's intention to establish a trust and specifying the trustee's duties and the persons who are beneficiaries and the amount of their beneficial interest. A declaration of trust also states a declaration of trust is irrevocable.

An "order" means an order adjudging a party to be incapacitated and appointing a guardian of the property of the proposed ward or an order appointing a guardian to serve during the minority of the proposed ward.
[12]  The terms of a trust must be stated clearly so that, without extrinsic evidence, the court or jury may properly interpret the trustor's intent. The evidence of this intent may be found in the language of the trust instrument, the circumstances surrounding its execution, the situation of the parties, and other evidence which may assist the court or jury in determining whether a trust was intended.

An "irrevocable trust" means a trust in which it is the duty of the trustee to distribute the entire beneficial interest of the trust property to the beneficiaries at the time of the trustor's death. An irrevocable trust does not permit revocation or amendment by the trustor or beneficiaries during the settlor's lifetime.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:06
