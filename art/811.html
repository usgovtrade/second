"I don't believe you can do anything for that boy."
  
  
   2.  With her father in a hospice bed after having an endoscopy, a woman is 
distraught to discover a lesion on his abdomen.
  
  
  
   3.  When a young man in Kenya is diagnosed with having one copy of the gene 
for sickle cell anemia, his future is not so bright.  However, with a little 
help from an innovative doctor, not only does the man recover, but the rest of 
his family does as well.  
  
  
   4.  A young woman on the autism spectrum has a difficult time trying to 
communicate with her boyfriend, but he does not give up.  
  
  
   5.  After losing his wife in a car accident, a man's grief causes him to 
forget to take his medication.  Fortunately, he had regular check-ups.  
  
  
   6.   A man with dementia is living on the streets of Philadelphia.  Because 
of the warm weather, a new disease, scurvy, has taken its toll on his health.
   
   As a result, his feet are incredibly swollen.  When he arrives at the ER, 
the staff is not sure if he is suffering from a bacterial infection, a viral 
infection, or scurvy.  The physicians have to put their heads together to 
figure out what is wrong with the man.  They finally discover that he is 
suffering from all three illnesses, and he will be just fine with the right 
treatments.  
   
   They decide to place him on antibiotics for the bacterial infection, 
vitamin C therapy for the scurvy, and anti-inflammatory medications to control 
the swelling in his feet. 
   
   As a result, the man has surgery for the feet, and he is back on his feet 
walking around town before the day is over.  
   
   The doctors discover that there are other cases like the man's in the ER. 
It's all about communication and a team approach to solving the medical 
problems.  
   
   A lesson learned is: There are a lot of medications out there that can cure 
many different illnesses, but only if you can figure out what is going on and 
treat the correct illness.
