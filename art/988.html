the desire for immediate solutions. 
We in Enron firmly believe that we need action. We cannot convince our 
customers to take shorter terms and sacrifice price if we cannot even provide 
them with material offers on which they can insist.
Enron has therefore decided to write down our receivables for well over 
$100m. We must reduce our risk. In this context, Enron Nordic Energy has 
today decided to sell forth-coming volumes in the physical market.
For those of you who are new to the business and may feel that the 
non-delivery risk has been reduced by booking out and offering out our energy 
in the secondary market, we should like to remind you that Enron's gain on 
energy trading is primarily related to the company that can offer the lowest 
price. 
We reduce our risk and we increase our competitive advantage when we can 
perform a trade and book out. I am convinced that there are few who can do 
that. 
Our solution is immediately effective. We will be writing down receivables as 
agreed with our customers, and we will increase our sale volumes. 
For the non-delivery risk to be removed, the industry must be able to offer 
guarantees of trade. We work with our customers to minimise risk and we have 
for many years used various derivatives to lock in the trade. This has 
allowed Enron to collect from our customers and avoid booking out with the 
counter-party. 
By selling out in the market and buying back later in the day, we can be 
sure that we have sold back at least some volume to be delivered against the 
trade. It therefore minimises our risk in a situation in which the power may 
be redirected, as Enron have been able to do from time to time. 
The fact that the market is volatile in itself will have an impact on our 
effort to collect the money due. This does not, however, change the principle 
that we should minimise our risk in the market by reducing the exposure to 
risk. 
In the end, we have taken a difficult but honest decision, but I would like 
to stress that this is something we had to do. We have always been in a race 
against the clock in order to maximise our sales, but our sales volume 
increase in itself has put more pressure on the market and brought the price 
down. In reality, our efforts to find other solutions have been exhausted, 
and we are running out of time to find options which will work in the market.

I believe that our immediate actions in the market will improve the 
climate. That is the reason why we have decided to act now. 
Enron remains the most experienced energy trader on the market and I am sure 
that our actions are what our customers expect from us. 
The Nordic market is particularly challenging. It has never been a problem 
for us to meet the financial requirements of the market, but as the 
difference between physical and financial market price has increased, we have 
concluded that it is necessary for Enron Nordic Energy to be active on the 
physical market.

India Dabhol Pwr Plant Sanctioned

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The India's Maharashtra state government Wednesday 
issued a statement saying it has sanctioned its plan to set up the third 
phase of the 2,184-megawatt power project in the state. 
Dabhol Power, Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit, has initiated the third phase 
of the project which would be a 2,400 MW, $3 billion power project.
Dabhol Power is a unit of Dabhol Power Company. Enron holds a controlling 
65% stake in Dabhol Power. 
Sanjay Jog 
Maharashtra State's Energy Minister, Sanjay Jog, said in a press statement 
that the decision has been taken after the power purchase agreement with the 
second phase of the Dabhol Power Project was terminated by the power 
company's sole buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. "This phase 
will be implemented within the existing non-payment of power dues situation 
and under the supervision of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board," the 
release quoted him as saying. 
In May 1995, Enron's Indian unit, DPC, and India's largest utility, the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, started negotiations for the 
second phase of the Dabhol Power Project. The plant comprises two phases. 
Phase one began operations in May 1999. Dabhol Power owns 95% of the first 
phase and 85% of the second phase of the project. 
In December 1995, DPC had initiated arbitration proceedings against the MSEB.

INDIA: New Delhi aims to help Enron patch up with utility.

05/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, May 22 (Reuters) - The Indian federal government is likely to help 
patch up multi-billion dollar energy firm Enron Corp's Dabhol Power Co with 
Maharashtra state's electricity board, which on Wednesday terminated a power 
supply agreement. 
The board, which is in default of payments, acted after DPC said the contract 
was being terminated following non-payment by the state electricity body.
"We are in favour of finding a solution and a patch up," a federal government 
official told Reuters. 
"The centre wants to act as a mediator and this is the situation where they 
should interfere," he added, referring to the centre's willingness to 
intercede as the power purchase agreement was negotiated in the early nineties 
and signed by a state government. 
The state board had served DPC with a preliminary termination notice, which 
gives six months to the company and the federal government to settle the 
dispute. 
In May 1999, the Maharashtra electricity board failed to pay overdue bills 
and the DPC pulled the plug on December 29, 2000 - finally prompting the 
board to make good the December 2000 bill last week. 
The move to end a row over a nearly $3-billion project which has become the 
largest ever foreign direct investment in India has won DPC the support of 
U.S. lawmakers in a move aimed at signalling to other global investors that 
Washington could not have been oblivious to the power project. 
A company spokeswoman said the firm would respond once it assesses the effect 
of the board's move. 
DPC, which holds the controversial power purchase agreement and the asset 
transfer agreement with the state electricity board, has also terminated 
those agreements. 
DPC is the first major power project to come up in India after the country 
opened up its power sector to private and foreign investment in the early 
nineties. 
Many other foreign and Indian firms rushed in to set up projects in an 
attempt to secure a piece of the power sector, seen as a potentially 
lucrative business. 
However, execution risks relating to a host of issues from environmental and 
forestry clearances to availability of coal have resulted in most of the 
projects not making it to completion. 
GROWING DISSENT OVER DABHOL 
There has been growing dissent against Enron among investors, which have 
accused DPC of charging uneconomical tariffs. 
Last November, the Maharashtra and central governments had given some 
guarantees to the DPC and the project to help Enron overcome its funding 
dilemma.
