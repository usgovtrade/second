From the same year, 1968, came "Krakatoa," by Spike Jones, made from a collection of sounds made by that volcanic island. Sitting in the middle of the Indian Ocean, Krakatoa gave off an eerie rumbling sound, as shown in _Anchors Aweigh_ by the Andrews Sisters, but "Krakatoa" came from the middle of the volcano's explosions, an ominous, menacing sound. Some people, such as the people of the island, who lived for days and weeks after the eruption, would have regarded these sounds as sounds of doom, but the musicians of _Anchors Aweigh_ saw only the joy of music.

Perhaps the most famous of the early sound effects albums was _Mission to Mars_ , made for Orson Welles' 1962 classic, _War of the Worlds_. This featured a number of "creatures" that invaded the Martian environment. _The Creeps_ was not only an influence on _Mission to Mars_ but for years had been a mainstay in movie theaters, with the famous sound of a hand scraping across a chalkboard. In a sense, the _Creeps_ may have been more important to those who heard it than to those who had recorded it, for it signaled the existence of the low-budget film industry.

In the early seventies the most effective use of sounds was not music but sound effects and atmospheres. The first of these was _Pigs_ , composed by Brian Eno, which was made into a short film, shown in a few theaters but mostly used for television commercials. The sound in this one consisted of an eerie whistle as a small bird flew along the road, which was quite unusual, and _The Creeps_ was also used again.

Probably the most well-known of sound effects from the seventies was _The Exorcist_ , made from the 1973 horror film. _The Exorcist_ included some excellent sound effects. For the opening scene, one of the heads of the two victims, who had been flayed, was dragged around on a stick. Noises were made by ripping through bedsheets, and a voice was used by a ventriloquist's dummy.

_Fitzcarraldo_ , the music for the 1982 film, was an example of non-musical sounds. The film was about a rubber baron, played by Percy Heath, who wanted to travel over the Andes Mountains in the Amazon jungle, to find rubber trees. Some musicians were involved in the project, but the sound effects in the picture were mainly from the jungleâ€”animal sounds and sounds of human beings singing, as well as wind, thunder, and waterfalls. _Fitzcarraldo_ is widely thought to be a "jungle" film, but no music was used in the soundtrack, no songs to be sung, and none of the characters were ever found singing. The music that one would hear while watching the picture was the actual sounds from the film, plus an orchestral score. This made the music even more effective, and it is still considered to be one of the greatest sound films ever made.

Sound effects have played a major role in some of the most significant films ever made, as well as the scores used to support the movies, but sound effects have also been used for other purposes, including advertisements. One such commercial was shown on television in 1966 by Dole, which showed a pineapple being peeled and shown to a family. In the commercials, the sound effects of the pineapple were the sounds of a radio announcer and a child saying, "Gee, it's my favorite fruit." Another commercial featured a can of pineapple rings that was being poured onto a snow-covered street. A fire hydrant suddenly burst out, blasting water onto the street. A couple walking in the street watched in horror as the woman's hat blew off her head into a dustbin, and a woman fell into the street, which now had a deep, slippery coating of ice.

Some of the earliest sound effects used in the commercial field were made by Walt Disney, who sold his Silly Symphonies (which started in 1930) to NBC and later became part of the Disney corporation. NBC hired the famed sound effects artist Walter E. Miller (1889-1974) to create some of the most memorable background sounds for some of its early programming. The three Silly Symphonies that were sponsored by NBC were _The Skeleton Dance, The Nutcracker Suite_ , and _The Old Mill_. The first two were both created by Miller and had excellent sound effects, while the _Skeleton Dance_ was directed by Ben Sharpsteen, who also had many of the film's musical instruments recorded by a musician. Miller used what were called sound effects _engineers_ (now called sound engineers) to record the sounds. The engineers played some of the noises, such as gunshots and thunder, while the musician recorded the sound of "the _Skeleton Dance_ " on a violin and other instruments.

_The Old Mill_ used a different method of recording, using a microphone to record the sounds at a slow speed. There was not much movement in the scene, but by listening to the recording and speeding up and slowing down the sounds, Miller managed to have the sounds "move." Miller continued this same idea for some of the Disney productions, adding some motion to the sound by having the sound of a whistle change pitch with the movement of a horse that was seen riding in a movie. This was not an exact science and much depended on the movement, but if done well, it added to the realism of the picture.

All of this was done with sound effects of thunder, animals, trains, and many other things that were incorporated into _The Skeleton Dance_ , which was called the best children's program on TV. But with the advent of television, there was more and more music involved, and it was felt that what was needed in the field were other kinds of sounds and noise.

In recent years sound effects have become more specialized. The sounds of the sirens on the New York City Fire Engine, for example, have evolved from the siren used on the Brooklyn Rapid Transit bus, to a large variety of sounds, such as the sound of a train wreck. A recent sound effect, when the fire truck engine runs into a fire, is that of the sound of a gun firing on automatic.

Some sound effects have been as ingenious as those in _Pigs_ , where a rubber band was stretched and pulled by the sound of a wind and even a pencil rubbing against a chalkboard. Other sound effects are actually combinations of existing sounds, such as one made for a commercial of a glass of water dropping into a sink. A glass was dropped, while another glass of water was poured into a pitcher that was dropped into a sink, and all the sounds were recorded on separate tracks, which were later played through the mixer. The last thing added was the sound of two water tumblers being knocked over in one motion, which played into the mixer at the same time that the two tracks began to play. The glass breaking into many pieces would have been recorded at the same time and used later to play into the mixer.

Some of the most used effects in films of recent years are the various kinds of explosions and gunfire, and this kind of music has taken on a very important role in movie history. With the advances in technology, and the fact that music in film has taken on a bigger role than ever, it is no wonder that many people are looking for ways to record these sounds and then to make certain that they are properly used in the productions.

The record is currently in the public domain. The reason that the record is in the public domain is that the work had been published and offered for sale before 1923. Since the copyright registration was in 1924, the work is now in the public domain. As previously noted, music has always played a very important role in film and sound film, and even in silent films, as well as on television. Many of the early sound films had sound effects that were recorded, even though there were no accompanying music or other performances, and music was not actually recorded in the studio. One of the first movies to feature the sound of a typewriter typing was shown in England in 1908, _Vampire Shadows_. Some of the early films that had sounds that were synchronized with their pictures were the British movie _Sensation Seekers_ , a picture of a woman dressed as a man, who would go out of doors at night, and make strange noises.

Early talkies had the soundtrack synchronized with the picture, which allowed them to use some kind of sound effects, although this was done only in the United States. _The Singing Fool_ was made in England, and other early films included those that were a mixture of both music and sound effects, like the movie _Fury_ , a combination of music, as well as several sound effects that were also used in other films.

It was during the early years of talking pictures that one heard "Boom Boom Boom" and "Seeing Nellie Home," which, unlike any of the other early sound effects, was recorded before it was used in a film. The record was used in the 1927 film _Show Boat_ , and it consisted of the sounds of things that were supposed to be heard on a plantation. Some of the more "realistic" sounds were of dogs, pigs, horses, dogs whinnying, chickens, bells</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:04:32
