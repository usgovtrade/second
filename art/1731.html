[name], you must have a mic in the background, you sound amazing on key!

Thank you, it is very helpful. I have started to try and be more aware of pitch with vocals because I know that if I have bad vocal technique for my voice type (F3-G#4) then it doesn't matter how much better the arrangement is or how well I have learned to read music.

I know a lot of singers in the F# and G# that can sing in tune, but not many that I have found do because it is not what is popular and what they are going to get the most amount of money for. Most of the time, I notice F# and G# to be the hardest types to be in tune with when singing harmony with others and I am in tune with most notes unless it is a piano piece.

I've been doing Aikido for about 5 years and I can't say that I've been much of a singer outside of karaoke. I've just recently found out I can sing higher than I realized as of late and when I found this thread it made me realize how to learn the correct way of singing.

The part of singing where it gets hard is when you start to sing faster. Especially when you sing in harmony. Because with my training, I am not able to tell much time apart, so it's hard to tell where to sing where.

I remember it being hard for me as well when I first started getting into singing and even now singing too fast can get me off pitch really easily. I think for me the key is to just slow down and find the correct note for the song and that way I can sing fast without worrying about it.

@[name], I had a few tips for you: I noticed in your post you mentioned starting to slow down your singing when you sing, I assume this is to ensure you are singing in the right key. If that is the case, I feel that learning what the note feels like, especially if your tone, means learning to read musical notation. Musical notation is a lot easier to learn when you are singing as opposed to playing an instrument.

In order to learn to read music you need to train your ear to hear where a note should be. As this is a lot easier said than done, you will need to be patient with yourself in order to get the hang of this.

You also need to try and slow down and take your time before singing. This will allow you to read music more easily and give you enough time to get the hang of it and feel out how notes feel on your voice before you try to sing any faster.

Lastly, as for the speed thing, I have seen others saying similar things. I know this can be quite hard to do but it is possible, so make sure you listen carefully to your instructors when you are practicing with them and make sure to do what they say when they tell you to practice it slow, so you won't end up like that person.

Thanks. I have been doing this for a while now... But it's not my strong point. I just realized how slow singing is as you pointed out. When you sing slow you can hear the notes right away... But I was singing when I was younger so I don't know if that is helping me or making it worse.

Also, it is hard to get the ear to see the notes when it's really loud but if you do this every day when it's not that loud you will eventually hear what you're singing right off the bat. I did this once in class and everyone told me how good it sounded but my teacher told me that I didn't sing correctly as my eyes were closed... haha.. I guess you have to get that perfect!

Finally, I have been doing my homework every night after school. It's not hard to get started. The hardest thing to remember is your right note and the left note. It's all in your head. The teacher will tell you what your first note is (the F3). When you have found the correct note, then your song is going to be perfect.

I do not mean for this to be rude but you sound like a boy soprano.
The top of your range in singing is middle C or middle D.
The lowest notes are F3 and G3.
Your voice is going to drop a lot if you sing your song at the top of your range.

Well, you can't say that I have a range. I just tried to make it as simple as I could for you to understand. My voice is deep.

Actually, a singer who goes from F3 to G#4 would be one of those people. But if you don't understand it... I'm sorry that it is hard for you to understand. That's why people say you need a teacher because the problem might not be the way you sing. Sometimes, it's just a matter of hearing your notes correctly.

I just know about the speed thing. I have tried to slow my singing down. But some songs are just that difficult to sing out loud for me. I still am trying to figure out the note that I am supposed to be on.

@[name], so you sound like a woman. I don't think that a woman has a range either. You are a female and you should stay as female.

I also am a woman and we can sing up to middle C and lower C#. After that, our voices will crack and sound horrible if we try to sing. And we can never sing any higher than middle C or C#. So your voice is not your singing range. Your singing range is the bottom of your range and the top of your range is the bottom of the range of a woman.

You don't have to sing a low voice. There are a lot of people who can sing as high as C4, and many that can sing as high as F#4. I have found that it helps me to know how to hit the notes correctly on the keyboard. It's easier to do if you have rhythm. This site is really helpful for me.

Not sure about high notes for you. But you are right.
I sing just in the range of F3.
I just can't sing the G#4 and below notes right now.

I'm doing everything that I can. Now I am just worried that I will never be able to sing any faster. I will try to learn my range and I'm going to keep practicing every night.

I've got my C#5 in an Aikido program with a teacher. The most difficult thing about this song is that the F# is the only black note, and I usually just sing the F# as an F. I'm working on remembering the key words to the song and singing them to help keep me in tune. With Aikido it's the same thing. It takes awhile to get it all perfect, but at the same time your voice will automatically get better.

When I was learning to read music, I had to be the person I would never be. I needed a lot of support. I had to learn to listen to myself.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:03:25
