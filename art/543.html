the necessity for a single point of truth and meticulous monitoring.
  By integrating financial and operational data to provide a snap shot 
statement of any entity at any point of time, we aim to give the 
user the information necessary for quick decision-making.

  * How do we store data

Electronic accounting data is key to the speed and functionality of any 
solution.  However, by utilizing a hosted model we can retain complete 
control of the data using secure encryption technology.

  * How do we offer the broadest possible utility

By providing a neutral data store, it means that any member of the 
community can query the data via an API or spreadsheet interface.

  * How do we promote collaboration

Building on this hosted environment, we should also be able to build a 
collaborative environment into the product.  

  * How do we present data

Utilizing common business objects, it means that the data can be imported 
and displayed in any business tool.  All data is stored in discreet objects 
to ensure that the data can never be incorrectly merged.

  * How do we develop a market for financial data

We can develop and market an interface that will deliver real-time data to 
the market in exchange for a fee.  This will offer a number of advantages 
for us, including:

  - Increased revenues from a single data source
 - Improved market efficiency
 - Improved price transparency

  * How do we create a viral model

These applications should also be marketed for a single fee in the form of 
API access.

  * How do we create added value

This helps the application to generate the added value that is essential 
given the proliferation of applications in this space.

  * How do we build loyalty

By supplying financial market data to industry end-users we can build loyalty 
and transactional revenues.
