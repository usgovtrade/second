Instead 
of going at 
least down you make it down.
And that just doesn't seem 
like a fair fight.
>> Well, all the world 
is a stage, 
but as long as the person's 
not breaking into 
a bank, the bank is 
the stage.
It might be a little 
dramatic,
but I think if the bank is 
not a physical 
bank, it's the stage.
 >> Here he comes now.
>> Oh, okay, this 
is 
>> Wait.
>> this is the actual, 
uh...
well, there's -- 
>> I know where 
it is.
>> You going 
>> Yeah.
>> there's a guard. 
>> Okay.
>> That's good, right. 
>> This is a real guard, 
okay.
>> No.
>> Okay, so I'm 
going to make 
a little pit stop 
here. 
You stay here. 
He's in my way.
>> Okay.
>> All right. 
And this is the bank that 
I'm doing it on.
All right.
We'll call this 
fake money.
We'll exchange this 
fake money for a real 
check. 
>> What about the guard?
>> I think he should see 
money going in and out.
 >> Wait. 
>> Okay, so I'm going to go 
talk to him.
 >> Okay, cool. 
>> Hi, 
>> Hi.
>> good, 
>> Here we go.
>> see.
>> Hey, 
>> Hi.
>> Hey, I got to 
the bank. 
>> Can you get into a 
real 
check, like it's 
the real checks that 
are coming out and in? 
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, perfect.
>> Okay.
>> That's good. 
>> Yeah, you guys go to 
the money, get your money.
I'm going to start 
with mine first.
And then you 
can fill your 
cup 
with the real money.
There we go.
>> Okay.
>> And... 
>> That's it.
>> Let's -- 
>> Who are you?
>> I'm Tony  Horton.
>> Okay, okay, we've seen 
you in the 
media before.
Why don't you give us the 
real checks and we'll try 
to see if we can get the 
real check back in here.
>> Okay.
>> Can you show me how 
you do it?
>> Look at this 
check, 
they're trying 
to get at you.
They don't want you to go 
through a check.
>> You're making it 
really hard.
>> They're trying 
to get at you. 
>> Let me come up 
and just.
>> It's not necessary.
>> You don't have to.
>> They don't want 
you to do it.
>> I'd like to know the 
fake 
>>> Look out.
>> There's the guard 
again. 
Okay, let's -- 
>> There's the guard. 
>> Let's pretend that we're 
getting into the real 
check.
We don't want any of your 
fake 
money in the real check.
>> Okay. 
>> And then we'll see what 
we 
>> Okay.
>> we do with the fake 
money. 
So, 
>> Okay.
>> they have it, 
right?
>> Yeah.
>> He's got this one, he 
doesn't have any of this 
one, 
>> Okay.
>> And then we'll go 
>> Yeah.
>> through the -- 
>> It's yours.
>> yeah.
>> What did he get?
>> Well, I 
thought it was one 
more that I had to put in, 
but I don't know.
>> You okay, man?
>> Yeah, we're 
good. 
>> Let me show you how 
you take --
how you take them 
out.
You can make this very 
quick.
>> But the guy's got 
my money in his 
pocket.
>> So, 
>> That's all right.
>> The other two, you have 
already gotten in there?
>> No. 
>> Do you have the 
money?
>> No. 
>> Then they 
can't do nothing. 
>> You want to try this?
>> Let me try.
>> Okay.
>> That's it. 
>> There we go. 
>> Here's the thing.
>> We still have this 
fake. 
>> Yeah, let's 
>> That's, let's try that.
>> Let's just do it 
and 
see. 
>> Then I don't get to 
take -- 
>> You have to give me 
the real check.
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> Then 
I 
can go with my 
money.
>> Yeah. 
>> So, 
I just want to 
>> okay, 
you go through your 
fake check and you take 
it.
>> Yeah.
>> This guy can't take 
anything out.
>> Because I 
know he is here.
>> Okay. 
>> Yeah, I'm going to show 
him a fake check. 
>> All right.
>> I go in here and 
I've 
already got 
my 
money, 
that's okay.
>> Cool.
>> Okay, now this is 
really important.
>> Okay. 
>> You know what I have to 
do 
before I even put 
it.
>> Sure.
>> Right?
>> You got to 
>> Yeah.
>> you don't have to 
>> He won't know.
>> You got to 
>> Yeah, 
do this.
>> So, okay, so I 
got 
this.
You don't think I'll be 
able to 
get 
>> Yeah, okay.
>> this much money out?
>> No. 
>> All right.
>> Put it in a 
card, and put the 
card in 
the 
bank. 
>> So you can't 
leave 
the real check.
>> I'll go through your 
fake 
and I go through 
his real.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, so we have 
now, 
>> Oh, man.
>> three of these.
>> Oh, that's cool.
>> We've already got two 
in the bank.
That was the 
real checks, 
that's okay.
>> Perfect.
>> So, now we're going to 
do this with the fake.
And let's get the 
real check 
going 
into 
the bank.
>> Okay.
>> He's trying 
to get 
>> Okay, so I'll do the 
fake check, 
right?
>> Yeah, 
go through the 
fake.
>> Cool.
>> All right, I'll do the 
fake check.
>> All right.
>> You going to be 
waiting?
>> Okay, you go 
>> Okay.
>> here to get the real 
check.
>> Yeah.
>> Then you'll 
have 
my money.
>> Yeah.
>> All right.
>> Cool.
>> And then they go 
through.
>> Cool.
>> All right.
>> Cool.
>> All right.
So, then we're going to 
get 
>> Yes.
>> out of this 
>> Cool, cool.
>> Now we can 
>> Yeah.
>> talk to each other 
everywhere.
>> Cool.
>> Good to meet 
you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Okay, 
good luck with the 
new bank. 
>> Thank you. 
>> All right. 
>> Wait. 
>> So -- 
>> That's our 
>> Wait, 
okay.
So, 
just 
to clarify, 
the problem we 
had earlier, 
is we 
started 
the real check 
with 
the fake, 
and it said.
I'm sorry, 
I didn't see it.
Where was the fake check?
>> Right.
>> We finished 
the fake, 
got it into the bank.
>> But the only way to 
get at 
the fake check was 
the real check
