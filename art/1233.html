The reason this all is happening is the same reason things like the "Great Culling" happened - The Earth is dying. All of the bad stuff that's happened in the past (World War I, WW2, Ebola etc.) has been done in order to help the Earth recover.

What happened to the dinosaurs was the precursor of something that was about to happen to the rest of the animals on Earth. The Earth was about to undergo a mass extinction like the one we are experiencing now. The dinosaurs knew it too because they were scared and fled in a great migration that spanned millions of years until the conditions were safe for them to return (and re-evolve). Eventually, the Earth got sick and it was no longer safe for the creatures that were meant to re-evolve to re-inhabit the planet.

If you have any questions about this, feel free to comment below and I'll do my best to answer.

We're very excited to be working with our friend, Ben at The Black Friday Project. We will be talking about his new documentary that has been making a lot of noise about the truth behind our media and information age, and how it has been manipulated, corrupted, and corrupted by money and what it has done to our country and the world.

After having read the article on Marijuana, Alcohol, and the War on Drugs by Gary Null, we want to see if we can help wake people up and bring them back to the truth!

Todd Nesloney says: "Cannabis is a herb that has many useful uses. When abused, however, it can lead to bad decision-making, mental health issues, and even death. That being said, if you or someone you know is suffering from mental health issues, there are a lot of great things out there that are very much worth talking about."

We're super excited to talk to a couple of some pretty great people this week. Our friend, Kevin Daly, has recently given up the bottle (as of this week). It is no coincidence that he is feeling more like himself than he has felt in the last 12 years. We had some great conversations with him, he had some amazing insights that we can't wait to share.

We also have a special interview with the creator of the popular YouTube channel, Veeone. He is working on a documentary right now that you guys can't miss! We have a great interview with him on the process of making documentaries, how he got started, and why he thinks it is the way to go. Please excuse his language and occasional cursing. We love him and think he has a lot to teach everyone about making films!

A new study of US citizens has revealed that they are still being surveilled by the NSA and other intelligence agencies despite public denials by President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and Congress, amongst others, that this is not the case.

This episode discusses the real state of affairs, why Obama made this announcement and what is really going on. We will break down everything you should know about the recent revelations that were publicly denied, and how the story is the same every time the media covers stories of government surveillance.

We also touch on the story of Mark Fulton and Kevin Mitnick who got off of the FBI's Most Wanted List - and why they were arrested again. We do a quick recap on the stories of the people that died mysteriously after releasing information from the Snowden docs as well as the story of the US government forcing Google to start censoring search results.

The reason we do this is because we are going to be talking to our old friend Kevin Daly, aka, BigBadVoodoo about his recent transformation and what it all means. He is super excited and we're excited to hear all about it.

We know, it is a long title. But a lot of things are happening. So let's see what this episode is all about:

We have a discussion on the ongoing news on the "Black Friday" events that are taking place. We're talking about what to do if you see protests against guns and why they are a good thing. We also have a short discussion on the use of the police in times of protests as well. We also have some new articles coming up that will cause the entire left side of our Facebook to just explode. So keep an eye out for that.

We have a great interview with our friend and fellow podcast host, Andrew WK. A lot of interesting things come out of this interview so we can't wait for you all to hear it! This will be a fun one because he is super honest about his past and where his mind is now. He has some excellent insight on spirituality, meditation, enlightenment and all of that good stuff that we really enjoyed talking to him about.

Lastly, please be sure to share this to your left wing Facebook friends so we can start an awakening!

Our friend, Kevin Daly, made a huge statement recently that he gave up Twitter, Tumblr, Google+, Facebook and pretty much all of the social media platforms. We found that to be a very controversial topic so we reached out to him.

Let me preface this podcast by saying that we have been asked by other listeners to change the name of our podcast and that we should be more focused on the "spiritual" side of the things that we discuss instead of being "political" and trying to get a change in the law. We also found a lot of criticism for not discussing "conspiracy theories" at all on our podcast because we are not "convinced" of the conspiracies and the people that we interview don't seem to be either. We know we're really good at interviewing people that aren't involved in all of this crap so we thought it would be best to stick to those sorts of people and we'd have to take everyone else's thoughts into consideration.

The feedback that we got from the show about the two-part episode on Chemtrails is that we should be "convinced" of the chemtrails conspiracy theories. We have some amazing stories that we cannot wait to tell you about. This time, we are going to dig deep into the chemtrails and take your questions so that you can leave with a whole lot of information, analysis, and a few laughs!

We have a fantastic conversation with the hosts of The Freedom Feens Podcast, Jason and Tim of TFF. We talk about the real "conspiracies" that have led to some of the best minds of our generation to be imprisoned, and some of the things that they've done for this world and how we need to continue to stand together and fight for what we believe in.

We also have a discussion on the media and its relationship with the truth, as well as how it is constantly creating controversy where there is none. There was a lot of confusion for the general public because so many people that were close to the event were telling their stories to the media that they did not even know what was going on. This happens in many cases as you will hear.

Also, we have some great articles this week, so make sure you read them and see what you think!

We had a very nice conversation with the amazing, Brian Glickman from Global Freedom Movement. We talk about his new podcast he's launching called "Life in the Balance," why he wants people to make a difference and change the world, and what to do with the "New Earth Crisis."

We have a super fast review of the movie "Snowden" because we had not seen it until very recently. We also have an update on the events surrounding Edward Snowden and why we believe that he's a very brave man. You will be shocked at what is going on and why we keep saying "This is a lot bigger than you think!"

Make sure you like, share, and subscribe! We are planning to release a podcast every week and we are so excited about it. Please also don't forget to comment below and let us know if you have any questions for us!

On our podcast this week, we are joined by Matt and his girlfriend, Kelly of Mad Dog Radio. We talk about their recent trip to Costa Rica, what their experiences were like, what they ate, where they slept, and where they saw. We also talk about the different kinds of cultures that they saw and how they reacted to it.

After seeing this interview, we decided to do our own mini-tour on YouTube. If you would like to see it, you can find it on our YouTube channel. Also, please remember to share, subscribe, and like our YouTube videos!</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:02:38
