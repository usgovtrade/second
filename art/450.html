crazy! No! I don’t want to be in jail. I can’t live in jail. Please. Let me 
go. I’ll go back to Mexico. I have three kids. I’ll be 
back in one month. No. One week. One 
week. If you let me go now, I promise you that I won’t come back here again."When he got this far in 
talking, I opened the 
gate. "Why are you 
letting me go? Who are you?"
In the darkness, I took out my knife. I felt it was better to kill him 
now. It’s too much of a risk to take 
him to jail, while he has been talking to the police all the time. "Stop talking. 
Get in the 
car and drive."He got into the 
car. I locked the gate, then walked back to my place. I was really thirsty, but 
I didn’t want to 
leave home.

Chapter Five

I took a long shower to calm myself. I was hot all over, 
and the cool water felt wonderful. I took a bath too. My body ached in many 
spots. I 
wanted to take a nap, but I just couldn’t. I went to the kitchen for a beer. It 
was 
already a few o’clock in the morning, but I thought I could sleep if I have a 
drink. In the cupboard, I saw a bottle of 
whiskey. This time I took it out, poured it in a glass, and took a sip. At that 
time, I was shocked that the glass was too full, and the whiskey just overflowed 
and 
went all over my hands. I was so angry. At this moment, the police and my dad 
were still nowhere to be found. The only thing that can go wrong is that this 
guy came back home drunk, and my dad would make him drink again. 
I ran to the kitchen to clean up my pants. I saw blood on them. I took a 
bleach. There were two types of bleach. The one you used on your clothes, and 
the one used for 
your hands, I chose the latter. I washed them all over and it made the skin 
flake off my 
fingers, which also made the pain worse. The whiskey had a bitter taste in my 
mouth. I was getting really pissed off, and I was going to kill him. If I 
killed him, 
everything would be over.
The whiskey made me feel good. And I had a plan. 
I was sure that I could catch him if I killed him with his own knife. So I 
cleaned up the blood all over the knife, and I put it in the kitchen. After I 
put it away, I felt better. I took out some beers, put 
them into a cool box, and walked back to the couch. When I woke up, I felt 
really hot. I was so thirsty, I 
couldn’t even talk. I walked to the kitchen, drank a beer and took a 
whiskey. I didn’t want to, but I was still 
hungry. So I had a sandwich, though 
I didn’t feel like eating. The only thing I 
wanted to eat was that Mexican food. I opened up a tub of nachos, then stopped. 
After I took one bite, I realized I was out of chips, and a few sips of liquor 
made me eat too many.
My body hurt and I was tired. I opened the drawer and found a cigarette. I 
pulled out a ashtray and lit up, then 
thought of all the things I had seen today. I was so pissed off at myself that I 
couldn’t feel anything, not even the cigarette. When I was done, I left the 
car outside and went to bed. I thought of the night before, the night I had my 
first boy. After a long 
day, I really wanted it. So I went 
to the living room and found the knife from that night. I opened it up. The 
blade was rusty. I cleaned it up, and went to bed.
The next day, I woke up with two beers in my hand. I got a 
bottle of water and called the hospital. I 
called many hospitals and it took me hours before I got a number of a hospital 
in 
Vegas. They said that the woman who was in ICU last night passed away a few 
minutes ago. I was surprised. That day, it wasn’t busy in the hospital, so I 
didn’t want to visit the 
woman, but I wanted to see her husband, if he was still in the hospital. But 
the nurse said 
the husband left yesterday and he went back to work. I stayed at work all day 
till evening. When I got home, I 
thought of the night before. I was looking at the pictures on the wall when I 
heard a knock on the door. It was a man who 
wore a suit and a badge. It 
was the police officer I saw the night before. He looked upset. He opened the 
door 
and asked me to follow him out. I wasn’t sure what it was about, but I 
followed him into the hallway. “Hey, 
where is he?” I asked.“Who?”“You know who. This young guy. He came here 
yesterday, took my car, and just now the man at the hospital told me that he 
killed the girl. That night, he was 
at the bar. I don’t know why he is here, 
but he is going to jail for the rest of his life. I was going to drink some 
pills and sleep here all day, but I 
thought I would talk to you before. I know he is your brother.”

Chapter Six

Before I could continue, my brother came out with the girl. She looked 
scared. “Take them to jail, 
and let’s go home.”“What’s going on? What did he do?”“Your brother 
killed 
some girl.”“What?”“I told you he was crazy.”“When did you see him?”“At 
the 
bar yesterday, in the day. He was in his hotel room yesterday and 
night, but 
he came back tonight, and I went to the bar to find him. I have not seen him 
since.”“How did he get your car?”“I 
don’t know.”“You should have told me. You brought a girl here to have sex with 
me, and 
you never told me.”“I didn’t do anything. I just brought her to you.”“You 
are lying! I asked you to pick up a girl for me. I didn’t ask you to fuck her 
here. 
That’s why we are in the bar, not the back room. I can’t believe you have 
sex 
in my car. Shit.”“I didn’t do that. She picked me up, and she 
came in the 
car. I don’t even know her. I just gave her my car. I didn’t have any 
part in this 
thing.”“You are unbelievable. You are so evil. I didn’t ask you to kill her.”“I 
know. I know I’m evil. But I did not kill her.”“Did you ask her for sex 
yesterday?”“No.”“Did you ask her for sex here?”“No.”“Or at the 
hospital 
when she was dying?”“I did not. I’ve 
never seen her.”“You are lying. I’m 
afraid of you. You are not 
acting right. Just stay here and give us an account, and we can let you go. 
They say that all prisoners have a chance.”“I am not. I’m no murderer. I didn’t 
do anything to her. She was at the bar with me. I saw her here. I just told her 
that she should come to my place, and I’ll pay her.”“Really? Who was she?”“She said 
her name was Maria, but she 
didn’t tell me anything else. She was with a man. I don’t know what happened 
to 
him. I don’t have any idea about the knife, but I’ve never seen her before in 
my 
life. She just showed up one day. They talked for a long time. They were 
talking 
about the future. I was gone</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:34
