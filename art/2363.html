Hey Guys! It’s been a little while since I’ve been able to blog so apologies for that. There’s been a lot of exciting things going on with me lately, including graduating from college, traveling to Africa, and going to Europe, to name a few! So yeah… life has been pretty hectic. Anyway, I have a new outfit post up for you today that features my favorite bag ever from H&M and some accessories. I got this bag a while ago and haven’t really used it because I was afraid I’d break the strap, but since it’s been working out I figured I might as well show it off. Since it’s now one year until my birthday, I figured I’d show you all what’s been going on over here. I have more pictures on Instagram. Hopefully I’ll be back next week! For now I hope you enjoyed this post. Please follow me on Twitter and Instagram and watch my YouTube for updates on my stories! Please leave a comment and let me know what you think. I love reading them and they really motivate me to make more posts. Thank you so much for reading! For a fashion post, click below for some of my favorite pieces. I hope you like it!
