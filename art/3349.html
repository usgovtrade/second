<Vandalite> moo
<Vandalite> :p
<soundray> nikin: no, you need to use /dev/sda1
<Lukian> soundray: I would very much recommend it if you're trying to boot a kernel that your monitor can't handle.  I use it on my laptop
<Razgriz> how can I find out if i need to run a script on startup ?
<jrib> nikin: sda1 is what is at the beginning of the drive when you have your bios showing all connected drives, so it may not be sda when you can mount it
<Vandalite> bittorrent is working, the linux client... but i have a question about the torrent servers in general
<Razgriz> in Gentoo I just looked for one of these in init.d/* and it was up there, easy to figure out, but I'm running ubuntu and can't find a simple way to figure out this...
<soundray> LethAL: so I must reboot after the kernel change?
<Vandalite> are they like the magnet links that you can download from?
<thoreauputic> Razgriz: in ubuntu it depends on the program - if the service runs in the foreground it will show up
<soundray> LethAL: how does the system know when to reboot?
<wisie> Hey all, I have a problem with my wireless... I'm on a desktop, running Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. The wireless card isn't working - its an IBM WLAN Notebook Adapter. It's on the list of supported network cards, but it doesn't seem to be working. Anyone got any ideas?
<LethAL> soundray, I don't know; I use a KVM switch
<Razgriz> thoreauputic: it's rtorrent, i'm using the terminal command: rtorrent  -u usr -d localhost:6969 /home/...torrent
<zorba64> Vandalite: are they magnet links
<soundray> LethAL: thanks
<Vandalite> ah
<Vandalite> yes, zorba
<jrib> Razgriz: usually you create a symlink to a script in /etc/init.d/  but you don't want to run a bunch of scripts from the command line when you start up your computer
<soundray> LethAL: thanks a lot for your help -- I'm booting right now
<LethAL> soundray, You're welcome
<zorba64> Vandalite: if so, then you need bittorrent with encryption
<Razgriz> jrib: ah, ok.
<Razgriz> jrib: so how do I do it then?
<nikin> jrib : its not hda , but hdb1
<Vandalite> ah, i see
<Vandalite> so the torrent servers have to be encrypted?
<thoreauputic> Razgriz: if you want it to start at boot, check in /etc/init.d  I believe it uses the update-rc.d command
<Razgriz> thoreauputic: ok, thanks.
<jrib> Razgriz: create a script and call it in /etc/rc.local  or make a symlink to /etc/init.d/name_of_your_script_here
<soundray> LethAL: if you have a chance, could you try a different boot option?
<nikin> but i am still stuck... grub sees that sda, but not sda1 :S
<Razgriz> jrib: thanks :)
<nikin> i need to get a kernel and set the root to my drive
<Vandalite> zorba: thanks for your time. how about ebay? i can see that there's a bit of difference in quality as it comes from an ebayer rather than some ubuntu user
<LethAL> soundray, I could try "debug" (I think that's the one...?)
<soundray> LethAL: did you set that in grub?
<LethAL> soundray, Nope
<soundray> LethAL: you have to add a line to your boot stanza in /boot/grub/menu.lst
<zorba64> Vandalite: not sure, never used ebays
<jrib> nikin: use:   root (hd0,1)
<Vandalite> not sure either
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: you can download torrents as magnets from any mirror
<nikin> ok
<LethAL> soundray, I thought that was it... I could try the debug one, the other only said 'Ubuntu'
<nikin> will try
<wweasel> I have accidentally removed my /dev/cdrom device from the desktop.  How do I get it back?
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: it's called "magnet"
<jrib> Razgriz: you can use update-rc.d if you want
<Vandalite> ah, i see
<Vandalite> thanks for the tip, thoreauputic
<soundray> LethAL: also, you should use your kernel version name, not 'Linux'
<nikin> hmm this works now :D
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: it's supported by all torrent clients that I know of
<jrib> nikin: excellent!
<nikin> just i had to set the root correctly
<LethAL> soundray, I have done that, you just said it twice ;P
<wweasel> !cdrom
<ubotu> I know nothing about cdrom - try searching http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi?db=ubuntu
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: I don't think the magnet links will be blocked by ISPs, but just as downloads, it's not guaranteed that they will be fast
<LethAL> soundray, I would use default except... :P
<soundray> LethAL: my apologies then. Have you tried the debug option, as I asked you earlier?
<jrib> nikin: what device is your root drive on?
<LethAL> soundray, I have
<nikin> jrib : i have 4 partitions, hda and the first one is set to root
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: e.g. it's pretty slow for me - in fact very slow
<nikin> i think its hdc
<Vandalite> aha, i think i get it. the reason why i'm finding the files is because of the .torrent extension, right? if i was to use windows clients it would probably not find the .torrent files if they don't have the extension. right?
<LethAL> thoreauputic, Isn't it illegal?
<Vandalite> like, for instance, i have a file called rtorrent.tar.gz
<soundray> LethAL: so I can't set it to boot without mounting root?
<LethAL> soundray, Are you using 2.6.15-27?
<Vandalite> but when i click on it in windows, it says i need to install it
<jrib> nikin: what are the options in /boot/grub/device.map for root?
<soundray> LethAL: I'll try it with a debug line. But that might be a bit drastic.
<Vandalite> and that's because it has no extension. when i go and grab a .torrent extension, it opens it in azureus instead, right?
<soundray> LethAL: yes
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: in fact most torrent clients check extensions, so I'd doubt they would see the magnet link unless it has the .torrent extension
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: azureus has a search function for magnet links - it's quite sophisticated
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: it's also really slow on my system
<Vandalite> right, right
<nikin> jrib : i have root (hd0,0) <-- hda1 , (hd0,1) <-- hdc1 and then root (hd0,2) <-- hdb1 and hda5
<LethAL> soundray, Set it to debug and also do sudo update-grub afterwards
<soundray> LethAL: I see, the debug option should log more output
<nikin> jrib : what should i set in device.map?
<LethAL> soundray, I'll do both at once...
<thoreauputic> Vandalite: try a different port - it speeds</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:53:03
