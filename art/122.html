our market to pursue a business plan that will eliminate the complexity 
caused by trading multiple L/C swaps on a given ECCL transaction and also to 
remove the complexity of booking the interest accrued on the L/C.  Also, the 
simplification we propose will enable us to develop a "commercial" L/C 
booking process to enable us to compete in the marketplace.   

To that end, we have been researching the different ways to accomplish 
these two objectives:

(1) Eliminate multiple L/C swaps and book the L/C interest.  There are two 
options:

We could book the swap against a long leg  of the trade and settle the 
swap's interest accrual and any long leg interest with the trade.  However, 
we are concerned with the credit exposure we would assume for the L/C 
booking the swap.  

We also considered booking the swap against a short leg, settling the 
swap's interest accrual and long leg interest, and then paying the swap's 
interest when the trade is settled.  Again, we are concerned about credit 
exposure.  We think this solution would work the best, but it's harder to 
book a short against a long.

(2) Eliminate the complexity of calculating and booking interest accrued on 
the L/C.  There are two options:

Settle the L/C interest accrual against the long leg of the trade.  ENA would 
be financially responsible for the L/C's interest.  

Settle the L/C interest accrual against the short leg of the trade.  ENA would 
be financially responsible for the L/C interest.

Your assistance is appreciated.   

Thanks,
