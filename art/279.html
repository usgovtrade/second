This is a ridiculous article.

> The potential applications of graphene are nearly endless

I would like to see this, but every single one of these claims comes from
patent applications.

_" You can take graphene and spread it out until you're transparent, but it's
still graphene."_

It is not true, you can separate a single layer of graphene from graphite with
a piece of scotch tape: <https://twitter.com/josephg/status/325321287174610

I'm not an expert by any means, but the article leaves the impression that
they've made graphene that is just as good as graphite, with all the same
properties like graphite, but that can be easily separated, making it far
easier to process.

It sounds interesting and I'm going to track down the original study it's
citing when I get a chance.

That's called "graphene nanoplatelets" and is essentially single-layer graphene
that you can dope/paint, etch, or stamp out. I don't know if it can be
painted/stamped out in bulk, but I'm sure you can scale to larger sizes than
single sheets.

~~~
mrb
In addition to what sp332 said, graphene can be delaminated into single
grahene with tape (see this tweet:
<https://twitter.com/josephg/status/325321287174610M>). I am not sure if it
can be done in large quantities though.

We need to make a big bet on this, or other people will. It's incredibly
valuable to be an early mover on a technology that is on the verge of
changing the world.

DaniFong
It could be a huge breakthrough.

There's real momentum behind graphene that we haven't seen in other science
-- it's the breakthrough that might not be.

There's definitely room for the most ambitious people in technology, and
there's no shortage of them.

Are you familiar with the history of computer chips?

When I was much younger and much stupider, I wanted a desk job but was
unwilling to sit in front of a monitor for 12 hours a day. So I looked into
jobs that would involve using an X-Ray to solder or connect things. Now, maybe
something in my 20's, if X-Ray technology allowed it, might be able to take
off again and we might have something new.

One of the key challenges for graphene is being able to control the process
that forms it.

That is, graphene will never be mass produced at the scale of the modern world
if every tiny bit of graphene has to be made at every step of production.

Sigh. This is what it means to be at a foundational moment in technology. If
this can be solved, then I'm fairly sure we'll see the fruits of it soon.

This article from 2011, on a similar subject, shows how it could be a big
breakthrough: <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3189447>

Could graphene make for the future of flexible electronics? Is it possible?

~~~
gambiting
Depends what you want to do. I don't think it will do well for flexible
electronics as it has extremely poor conductivity - just look at this video:

What is the significance of single-layer graphene? Would it be possible to
create a "multi-layer" graphene?

------
J3L2404
Heh. You have to tell your customers before you launch the product because it
may be a little expensive to recycle.

------
geuis
The significance of graphene here is not the chemistry. It is, as the article
mentions, the manufacturing.

andyl
Hurray, graphene is for real. I can't wait for super-fast Internet (tm).

seaguy94
In what way is this different than other carbon compounds, like diamonds,
graphite, etc.?

~~~
cbr
Diamond is really complicated and expensive to manufacture. Graphene has the
advantage of being simple and cheap to manufacture. In addition, graphene has
the potential for new materials properties we have never had before, including
extraordinary conductivity.

Wow. Great Article!

Woah, I really need to wake up and do what I have to do to make graphene!

Buy tons of silicon! And buy a vacuum chamber to make your own graphene by
heating silicon in the vacuum. It will get easier later because you can make
graphene from the gas after the silicon gets very hot.

Graphene can be delaminated into single graphene sheets with Scotch tape:

He's making flakes, not a flat sheet.

Great discovery, right?

Well, wrong...

I'm really sorry to say but I'm not sure how you see this as a breakthrough
in science.

~~~
mrb
I believe you are misinterpreting the significance of single layer graphene
with a grain of salt. If it can be separated out and grown in large enough
sheets to be used for making functional material/devices/wafers, then it is a
breakthrough.

~~~
brunnsbe
I said graphene is no scientific breakthrough. It's just a layer of graphite.
This means the significance of this is just that now you can take some paper
and separate it from a battery. Or something similar.

I know what you mean. But it's like saying you have isolated the source code
of Internet Explorer 9. Well yes that's cool, but what does it mean for
everyday life?

The significance of this is that people are running around claiming new</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:21
