Jumping Ship

A New Generation of Women Are Turning to Life on the Line for a Last Chance at Redemption on the Waterfront.

Maggie’s Promise tells the incredible true story of the most infamous woman in the history of the U.S. Navy. While many stories of women on the high seas are apocryphal and overblown, the truth about Mary DeWitt (Burns) is far less melodramatic, more tragic and ultimately more inspiring. From an early age, Mary is torn between being a carefree child and following a more practical path: to become a career woman, wife, and mother. A lifetime in the Navy promises stability, discipline, and family: a dream-come-true for Mary, and the means to provide for her loved ones and herself. She excels at her duties—until World War I destroys the world she knew. Injured in a bombing raid while serving at a destroyer base on the East Coast, Mary loses her footing in civilian life, and her relationship with her husband threatens to unravel. The one thing Mary cannot shed is her deep sense of responsibility to family and country—she knows it’s not the same, but has nowhere else to go. A deep love for her country fuels Mary’s lifelong struggle to reconcile the ideals of the U.S. Navy with her desire to be a good wife and mother.

A bold, beautifully rendered film, Maggie’s Promise tells a unique and compelling story: a woman in search of her true self; a father’s duty to his child; the price of idealism, of freedom, of patriotism; and the ultimate question: how far will you go to please your country?

Maggie’s Promise is also available as a special edition DVD! The special edition features three additional scenes that explore the story in greater detail, plus an original commentary, featurettes, and behind-the-scenes footage.

The American Dream: What If There Wasn’t One?

The American Dream: What If There Wasn’t One?

How far will you go to satisfy your ambition, and at what cost? That’s the story of Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who came from the depths of the steel mills of Pittsburgh to make her dreams come true in the Roaring Twenties in America.

As a young woman, Gilbreth witnessed poverty, alcoholism and physical abuse among her working-class family. She found salvation in numbers and in work. Encouraged by her employers, she began documenting every step of their industrial processes. She developed a method of recording this data, a system that could be used in the homes of people all over the world.

Gilbreth taught herself how to become a professional manager, and her theories gained worldwide recognition. She was a pioneer of modern management, and her ideas spread all over the world. As she advanced through the business world, however, she found herself losing the home she loved.

Gilbreth was the first wife of Frank Bunker Gilbreth, a mechanical engineer and an innovator in the emerging field of motion pictures. They met during the early years of the silent film industry, and it was his genius with his hands that encouraged Gilbreth to turn her attention to science. He gave her the confidence she needed to see herself as a scientist, and he worked tirelessly to see her ideas realized. The Gilbreth household was a laboratory—and, through her father’s influence, a meeting place for creative and intellectual people from all over the country.

The American Dream is based on the biography by Lillian D. Gilbreth and Mary C. Gilbreth (Simon & Schuster, 2015).

Lillian Gilbreth is an early example of a woman in science and technology. Her experience of moving up in society, learning to see herself as a leader and a manager, gave her the confidence to put her ideas on paper. And with her father’s help, Gilbreth became a leader in the workplace.

Although they worked together as a team, their marriage was difficult. Forced to choose between success in her work and success in her personal life, Gilbreth chose the former, keeping her own dreams on the back burner for many years. She never lost her belief in the importance of work and love, but in the end, Gilbreth decided it was time to choose love.

“It is true that my mother did not succeed in the business of love, but she did succeed in making people laugh at many things.”

–Lillian D. Gilbreth

Lillian Gilbreth’s story is one of persistence. In a time when women were not encouraged to stay in school, Lillian completed a full college education despite multiple obstacles. It’s a story of perseverance in the face of challenges.

“How will the millions readied for life in American homes and offices use the time, energy and money they save?”

–Frank Bunker Gilbreth

To answer this question, people in the Roaring Twenties worked hard. They pushed themselves to do their best work and push it out the door in the shortest amount of time possible. There was an enormous pressure to perform—and when the going got tough, people left the workforce.

Gilbreth understood her people, and she knew that if she didn’t maintain constant pressure, she’d lose the race. So she worked around the clock, living in the homes she built, until she reached a point of exhaustion. It wasn’t until she learned to be an expert at managing herself that she found her passion for work again. She was able to turn her home into her laboratory, her office and her playground—a workshop for her projects. She was proud of what she accomplished.

The American Dream is produced by Anne Heslop-Marshall for the Heslop-Marshall Foundation.

The American Dream: What If There Wasn’t One? is supported by PBS pledge drives.

Lillian’s Playroom: A Mother’s Touch

Lillian’s Playroom: A Mother’s Touch

A mother’s touch is a blessing. When Lillian Gilbreth loses her son Tommy to polio, she takes up her pen and paper to express her grief. Her pain and frustration turns to empathy as she writes about the experiences of people who live a few doors down from her home in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

It’s no wonder she felt compelled to share her stories of sorrow and of joy—she had been both the object and the cause of such trials. But Gilbreth did much more than write about her life: she transformed it. Her children’s books, “Mother’s Playroom” and “The White Dot,” became part of millions of homes, schools and libraries.

“By the time I was 17, I knew I wanted to help people in some way. And in a way, that’s what happened, in little moments—every person I ever worked with.”

–Lillian D. Gilbreth

By age fourteen, Lillian was working as a cashier at a movie theater, and the following year she graduated from high school at age sixteen. After graduation, she began work as a cashier at a bank. During World War II, she went to work for the United States government in war-time Washington, DC. Her intelligence and her dedication to her work made her attractive to the Army, and when the war ended, the military hired her to prepare for a European post-war. Gilbreth was twenty-five years old at the time, with three years of college behind her.

Gilbreth’s determination and her intelligence made her a perfect fit for the new jobs, and her future looked promising. She was confident that she could get ahead and get promoted, but she was also the wife of Frank Bunker Gilbreth, a mechanical engineer who was doing work for the government. His job took him away from home, but he could often be found in Lillian’s arms at the end of the day, exhausted and happy.

Unfortunately, the pressure of her new job and her marriage began to make Lillian sick. Gilbreth developed insomnia, and her symptoms of anxiety and insomnia combined to make her physically sick. The couple traveled often, and that meant that Lillian couldn’t get her children to school. Even worse, her son Tommy became ill. He had always been frail, but</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-21 20:54:10
