technology company. And now that it's
an enormous organization, everybody's
saying where are we going? How are we
moving forward? And people have
a very clear sense. And that's
all I've ever wanted was a clear sense
of what we're moving towards. One of
the things I did when I got to Google
was I said look we want to build the
ultimate search engine on the internet.
And we want to be a world class
search engine. And everything else we
want to do really is really about the
search engine and that's it. Now once
we've got that in place we're going to
go and do other things. The other thing
that's really important for me is the
search engine is our way to show what
we know about you and your interests
to advertisers. It's our way to show
it to our product group, it's our way
to show it to other people in the
company and if we do that well, if
you're comfortable with the way we're
doing this and it looks like we're
doing it well, then the search engine
will grow. And you will stay with us
and you'll get more capabilities. But
if you are not comfortable with that,
then if you want a more ad-free way of
getting to content or we're not making
this easy to use or the UI is taking a
hit, then you should probably be moving
on. And I don't blame anybody that does
that, because we should have put the
time in to give them something that
works and we didn't. I don't want to
use this as an example, but it happened
with the iPad in 2012, and it happens
over and over again.
But over time you'll look back at this
and I was just happy that people liked
what we did. That was the most
important thing. So we started with the
search engine. That wasn't the only
thing that we were doing in Search. We
also wanted to support local search,
video search, the Knowledge graph and
so on. So it's not just search, but
everything else we are doing today is
built on the Search foundation. As
we've got experience with doing those
things, we're starting to add more and
more of the things we were building in
the mid 2000s but it's an all-hands
effort. And that's the way you
scale a technology company.
And what does it look like as a CEO,
you mentioned the two examples earlier,
and there are many other examples. You
want to give users what they want and
you want to create an atmosphere of
safety, where people feel that it's
going to get better over time. And I've
been at this company for seven years,
just about. But let's take just a few
of those and go over them. So the first
one is, when we do a search and a
result pops up, what's the first thing
you want? The first thing you want is
there's a nice visual indication that
we're finding something. That the page
is being crawled and the query is being
formatted correctly. And that's what
we deliver. We are finding things as
fast as possible for that query and
you want to know that. That's very
important for what we're doing. We
don't know what you're looking for yet,
but we are going to find it. And as we
find it, you want to get the right
results, the things that you're
looking for. And that's why search is
so powerful. Because we can find
information that you are interested in.
Now, getting the results is an
incredible challenge. So for any query,
it could be hundreds of billions of
potential results, which is a huge
number and you need to make sure that
the ones you find are in a useful
format. And so we did some work and
today we have a very important idea
called the visual interface. And in
that visual interface is the search
result that gets shown to you when
you're doing a search. And I really
think that's a breakthrough. It's the
first time that we actually find stuff
for you based on what you are looking
for. And that's what the Search is all
about. And that's why it's great. And
over the last seven years, we've gone
from that visual interface to an
entirely visual interface. And just
looking at the video of the search, and
thinking about what it was and how it
was working, just being able to look
at the thing we did seven years ago,
it's an incredible feat. Now this is
something we have been doing for a
while. There is some interesting stuff
at the end of this, a lot of machine
learning on a product that we are not
really putting into a lot of advertising
or the branding that you've got, because
it's very interesting. I think it's
something we have just begun to do and
where it will go, we'll see. But on the
Search side, the work that we did with
the visual interface, our next
thing to do was understand that users
want to find what they're interested in
and show it to them. So instead of just
being shown a web page or an article,
we show them what the article is about.
We show them the pictures in the
article, and so on. And this is
what we did with a new product called
images. And images, the way we thought
about it, was this is a two step
process: one we're going to crawl and
find images for you, two we're going
to create a visual interface for you,
which is the image viewer. So
in this, the user starts by telling us
that they want an image. So this is a
query, this is a picture, and
then they tell us the image they want
to see. So it starts to bring up the
image that the user wants to see,
whether it's from a photo site or from
a web site or something like that. And
it shows it to them, it zooms in on it
and shows them all the pictures around
it. And it's got a pretty UI to help
you do what you want to do. So if you
want to view it full size, you can do
that. You can download it, you can
share it. It's a pretty interesting
thing. And now this is still being
built out. And you know this was the
thing that we were talking about a few
weeks ago, this whole idea of having an
interactive voice response or some
sort of automation where you can get
your groceries delivered at your house.
And we could take this and say that
could be a very powerful thing that
you're looking for, but let's take
images, which is now pretty mainstream,
and see if we could take it to that
next step and do something really
powerful. And then that lead to another
product called the visual discovery,
where we show you images that we think
are similar to what you were searching
for, because we want to make sure you
see the really good results. So you'll
notice in the image here, there's a lot
of different images that are
similar to what you were looking for.
But at the end of the day, if we take
an image, in this case the thing to
the left is very close, and then we
look at the image and we say, you
know, there's a lot of people who
love this image, what about taking it
to the next step. And so for us this
is the natural thing. But in today's
era, that UI needs to happen. And this
idea of you're a human sitting in front
of a computer, you want to interact, you
want to get stuff done. And as a matter
of fact, the most significant thing is
that it can look up where it's being
used, so we know what to show you next.
You're going to do better because we've
got a bunch of pictures of this product
and let's see what you do when you're
thinking about it. So there was a lot
of work that we were doing here and
we're still doing it. And a lot of
stuff here and that work is really
exciting to me. And the big idea is
that we want to get you information
that is useful to you. So we don't
just want to take the words from a
keyword and show you that. We actually
want to take what the language is that
you use and show you that, because we
know that that's what you're looking
for. And the same with people. We know
that this company is talking about
these guys. That's what they're saying.
So this whole concept of showing
people things based on the queries they
are using is something that we
started doing about a year ago. And it
went through, and I want to tell you
about what we have done so far, I want
to explain why we are doing</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-25 08:18:48
