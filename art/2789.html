My favorite of these t-shirts... this is the type of shirt that I like. If I can wear it in public, I do. They are comfortable to wear, great colors, and can wear on any occasion. The slogan is unique and really reflects a portion of my personality and what I like to do.

I wore this around, but did not end up buying it. It was really cool how this went from being a white t-shirt to a distressed-look, blue-colored shirt in just about 5 minutes! But, I decided against it because I want an actual distressed-look, blue-colored tee. I think it would look great on me!

This really is a great t-shirt! But I wouldn't have picked this particular design had I not seen it at one of my favorite stores, H&M, before. But I didn't want to spend my money on another shirt when I just got the one I wanted. I still love the shirt, just a different one. :)

I love these shirts, they're super comfy. My only regret with this shirt was that I tried to wash it and it turned yellow in the front and back of the shirt. I didn't think I put in enough detergent so next time I'll make sure to wash them in cold water and I hope they will fade. I've bought all of the shirts on here so far and love them all.
