The Rampant Wolverine is a lost 1923 American silent western film directed by and starring Richard Barthelmess, and featuring Boris Karloff. This was the first of Karloff's eight appearances in the sound era, and also one of only two sound films he did not appear in with Bela Lugosi.

Plot
As described in a film magazine, Richard "Dick" Moore (Barthelmess), heir to an enormous and almost bankrupt lumber business, has been ordered to go to the lumber country of Washington to collect a huge debt for his father, who is serving a long prison term. He is accompanied by his friend, Ed Burton (Preston). A series of events leads Dick to believe that his father's partner is plotting to capture Dick's entire property, using a false marriage contract between Dick and the partner's daughter as an excuse. Dick kills the man, and when brought to justice stands trial for murder. During the trial the girl's lover, Dr. George Macfarlan (Sturges), is found shot to death. Dick escapes conviction but then becomes a fugitive, pursued by men of high social position who believe the partner of his father to be innocent of wrongdoing. Dick becomes the guardian of John Wilson (Littlefield), the daughter of Macfarlan, and eventually returns to his own home.
