How to access an object outside its Class?

I'm writing a class, where i have 2 instances of another class, which are in the same file, and in a different class. The instance is the "player1" variable.
How can i access a variable of this class in another class ? (e.g. when another function is called, that variable needs to be updated)
class mainPage(Frame):
    def __init__(self, master):
        #self.parent = Frame()

        Frame.__init__(self, master)
        self.grid()

        self.action = Button(self, text="Start", command=lambda: self.game())
        self.action.grid(row=2, column=0)
        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        grid = self.pack(fill="both", expand=True)
        self.player1 = Player(grid, "black")
        self.player2 = Player(grid, "blue")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if sys.platform == "win32":
        import os
        app = mainPage(None)
        app.mainloop()
    else:
        from Tkinter import *
        app = mainPage(None)
        app.mainloop()

EDIT:
This is my attempt to solve my issue:
class mainPage(Frame):

    def __init__(self, master):
        #self.parent = Frame()

        Frame.__init__(self, master)
        self.grid()

        self.action = Button(self, text="Start", command=lambda: self.game())
        self.action.grid(row=2, column=0)

        self.update = Button(self, text="UpDate", command=self.update.update)
        self.update.grid(row=1, column=1)

    def update(self):
        print(self.player1.player1_name)

The error message is:
AttributeError: 'tkapp' object has no attribute 'player1'

A:

First and foremost, when you have a lot of work to do, break it down into small steps. You'll be happy you did. So instead of looking for the code that does everything, I suggest you create a main function that does a few things:

initialize the GUI
create a Game class
initialize the game as a Game object
start the game
return to the GUI

Then create an update function for the game:
def update(self):
    print(self.player1.player1_name)

This way, you will be able to see the problem before anything else and you'll be able to resolve it in a matter of minutes. Also, the way you initialize game was using lambda, which can be inefficient and make things more complicated. You could do the same with
game = Game(self.player1, self.player2)

In summary, this is how you would rewrite your code (see comments):
class mainPage(Frame):
    def __init__(self, master):
        # initialize the game with values obtained from previous controls
        self.game = Game(self.player1, self.player2)
        self.game.start()

        Frame.__init__(self, master)
        self.grid()

        self.action = Button(self, text="Start", command=self.game.start)
        self.action.grid(row=2, column=0)

        self.update = Button(self, text="UpDate", command=self.game.update)
        self.update.grid(row=1, column=1)

    def update(self):
        print(self.game.player1.player1_name)

class Game:
    def __init__(self, player1, player2):
        self.player1 = player1
        self.player2 = player2

    def update(self):
        self.player1.player1_name = "New Value"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if sys.platform == "win32":
        import os
        app = mainPage(None)
        app.mainloop()

Now all you need to do is start the game in mainPage. As for updating the GUI, you'll have to figure that one out yourself.
(btw, your code is really missing docstrings that explain what each variable is doing. For a start, I would change self.player1 to player1 since that's the name of the variable, and instead of creating new variables like player1_name, you can store player1 in a different variable (e.g. self.player1.name) so you can easily change it later, if needed.)

A:

In your question, you mention this line:
self.player1 = Player(grid, "black")

So, you need to take a look at Player class, and create a method in it that returns the score to self.player1 object.
class Player:
    ...
    def addPoints(self):
        self.score += 10
        self.player2_name = "black"
        self.player2_score = 10
    ...

You need to create such a method in every class that is dependent on player1 object. For example, let's say this is a class where you need to call addPoints method.
class PointCalculator:
    ...
    def updateScore(self):
        self.player1_score += self.player1.addPoints()
        print(self.player1_score)

Also, you may want to include Player class and updateScore method in another class (let's say GameController), then use self.player1.addPoints() method.

You mentioned self.player1_name = "a" method. So, you need to store "a" string value in a different variable. Also, this "a" string must be accessible to player2 object (so that a second player can see it). You could, for example, create a class variable called player1_name, and access it like this:
class mainPage(Frame):
    def __init__(self, master):
        self.player1_name = "player1"
        self.player2_name = "player2"

        Frame.__init__(self, master)
        self.grid()

        self.action = Button(self, text="Start", command=lambda: self.game())
        self.action.grid(row=2, column=0)

        self.update = Button(self, text="UpDate", command=self.update.update)
        self.</div></body></html><!-- 2022-07-17 11:30:10
