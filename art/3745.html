It describes the club's mission to "explore and observe...the unknown" as well as its influence on science fiction, the paranormal, and the space program. Much of the documentary concentrates on the early expeditions to Mount Palomar and the discovery of Pluto.
I Don't Like Having Snakes Around: A Documentary (Vols. 2 & 3) by Bob Fouts and Gerry Fouts - VOLUME 2 covers the period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. It describes how the club's focus changed from individual expeditions into a social organization concerned with the public's role in science, as well as a means for preserving the American frontier through exploration. Particular emphasis is placed on the club's role in space exploration, public understanding of science, and education.
I Don't Like Having Snakes Around: A Documentary (Vol. 4) by Bob Fouts and Gerry Fouts - VOLUME 4 covers the period from the mid-1970s to present day. It describes how the Explorers Club has grown from a very small organization to one of the largest and most influential non-governmental organizations. The club now includes scientists, professionals and everyday people who join the club for a variety of reasons, but all for the common purpose of exploring, discovering and getting involved with science.

The Explorers Club has an extensive video archive of its many expeditions, many of which are available for download from the site's main page.
