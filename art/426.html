DARLENE GASPARINI:
Yeah. I know. We've been 
saying, like,  in the film. 
When you have two black 
people in this film. This 
is going to be really 
interesting, I'm sure. 
Ruthless. 
The year of the dog or the
Year of the Rat, the Year 
of the Wooden Table, 
which comes first. 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  Yes. 
For your information, 
those are a couple of 
Chinese zodiac terms that 
was not really popularized
for Western culture till 
I think at least 1900. 
[ Laughter ] 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  The 
year of the Rat, I think it
is 1920. 
I do not remember. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD:  Yeah. 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  But 
you can be sure that you 
know every single Asian 
person who is on this 
panel will probably know 
that. 
It was not really popular 
in the US at first. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD:  OK. 
OK. What's the story? 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  So the 
Rat has always been the 
year of the Wooden Table. 
And the year of the Wooden 
Table's actually kind of 
an inside joke. 
It's kind of like those 
songs, you know, where 
they all mean something. 
Where they have a 
double-meanig. 
Like, it's really hard for 
a white person to pick up 
on that. 
And if you think you know 
what the Asian person 
means, but you don't. 
The Year of the Wooden 
Table, it just basically 
means a wooden table in a 
very fancy restaurant. 
So you have a lot of 
business in the year of 
the table. 
So sometimes people would 
just be like, oh. You 
know what? 
A lot of the tables at this
club in the end of the year
are kind of, you know, 
tables with some 
parchment. 
So they're kind of like 
wooden tables. 
We always thought that 
people just assumed the 
parchment was really nice 
and beautiful. 
And the reason why the year
of the table, the 
tablecloth, it's a table 
that is really really cheap.
So the tables are kind of 
cheap. 
But you know, to the people 
who have really expensive 
and nice table cloths. 
They're really poor. 
They can't afford it. 
So I thought that the table
in the end of the year, the
fancy table, is actually a 
cheap table with the best 
tablecloth you could have. 
So that's what's the story 
behind the Year of the 
Wooden Table. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  We're 
gonna see if it's, like, a 
bad year or good year. 
We'll see what happens. 
[ Laughter ] 
RUTH LAUGHEAD:  Yeah. I 
like it. 
Yeah. 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  It 
makes total sense, though. 
Like, in ancient times, 
like, let's say, you're 
talking, like, the ancient 
Chinese zodiac. 
Like, you know, people like 
to eat a lot of meat. 
They would eat meat off the 
floor. 
And then in modern times, 
like, it's not really 
something we do anymore. 
The tablecloth, it's like 
something else. 
Like, this is, like, a real
new age type of thing. 
Yeah. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  Yeah. 
[ Laughter ] 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  We're 
gonna find out. 
OK. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  So my 
background, I spent most of
my time in the performing 
arts. 
When I was first going into 
the performing arts, I 
really enjoyed dancing 
because I was really 
involved in athletics. 
[ Applause ] 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  And 
I'm a dancer. 
[ Applause ] 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  I'm a 
dancer. 
And I had always felt like 
people always called 
themselves dancers. 
And if you're a dancer, you
know, you must be very 
flexible. 
[ Laughter ] 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  So I 
had kind of grown up with a
lot of dancers in my family.
So it was kind of always, 
you know. 
I felt really confident. 
And I felt kind of shy. 
I was like oh. You know 
what I mean? 
I think because of that. 
I was always very, I mean, 
you know, I think because 
of that, I was always very 
nervous about starting 
college, because I have 
never been to college. 
I really, I had never 
heard, you know, first 
generation college student.
Because I went to private 
schools. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  I had a 
lot of siblings. 
And I have like three 
brothers and two sisters. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI: 
Yeah. 
So I had already gone to, 
like, all three types of 
private schools and a lot 
of dance schools, where my 
mom and my dad worked at 
a lot of -- my parents 
work at a lot of different 
schools and also with the 
Chinese association. 
So, they had a lot of 
events and performances. 
So I would help out. 
I would dance at the 
performances with my mom. 
So I always had a lot of 
training, like private 
training as well, that 
helped me keep up my dance 
ability. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI:  And 
this is also where I 
learned how to deal with 
being a minority. 
Because, you know, in 
schools. 
We had a dance team. 
It was amazing because it 
was like 40 percent of the 
kids were black, 40 percent 
were white. 
And 40 percent of the kids 
were Filipino and 
Filipino-Americans. 
And I had always felt like 
the white people and the 
black people always looked 
at me. 
I was like, oh. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI: 
Yeah. 
And I was like, well, they 
kind of don't look at me 
that way, because I'm a 
dance team member, I'm 
never the last person. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI: 
Sometimes I would get the 
flunk out. 
But, yeah, it was really 
wonderful. 
And it was a lot of really 
talented people. 
And it was really cool. 
So that was the part. 
And I did a lot of stage 
presence. 
I did a lot of things that I
really enjoyed, and as I 
kind of got older, I kept 
performing, and it kept 
pushing me, you know, to 
always want to push my own 
boundaries. 
So that was the beginning. 
RUTH LAUGHEAD: 
DARLENE GASPARINI: 
And I realized that my 
parents both really love to 
perform. 
Like, they're so funny. 
Like, they love to go 
around and perform on 
cassette tape with their 
friends. 
And just so</div></body></html><!-- 2022-06-12 21:01:33
